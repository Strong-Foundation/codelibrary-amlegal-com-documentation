the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
that next succeeding day which is not Sunday or a legal holiday.
      (2)   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last
day for doing the act or before its usual closing time on that day, the act may
be performed on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal
holiday.
      (3)   "Legal holiday," as used in divisions (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this
section, means the following days:
         A.   The first day of January, known as New Year's day;
         B.   The third Monday in January, known as Martin Luther King day;
         C.   The third Monday in February, known as Washington-Lincoln day;

202.06 CONFLICTS OF LAWS.
   (a)   All ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations of the
Municipality, and all parts of the same, enacted prior to the date of the
adoption of these Codified Ordinances and inconsistent or in conflict with any
of the provisions of these Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed, save and
except any ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation, or part of the same,
expressly excepted from repeal by the ordinance that adopts these Codified
Ordinances. No ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation, or part of the same,
of the Municipality, that is not inconsistent or in conflict with any of the
provisions of these Codified Ordinances and/or that can be reasonably
interpreted to be compatible with the provisions of these Codified Ordinances,
shall be deemed to be repealed by the adoption of these Codified Ordinances.
Such ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations, and all parts of the same,
shall continue to be viable and enforceable by the Municipality.
   (b)   In the event of a conflict between any of the provisions of these
Codified Ordinances, or between any of the provisions of these Codified
Ordinances and a provision of any standard code adopted by the Municipality
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.231 or a Municipal Charter, the provision that
establishes the higher or stricter standard shall control. In the event of a
conflict between any of the provisions of these Codified Ordinances and any
provision of State law, including rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to
State law, the State law, rule or regulation shall control if it is of a kind
required to be in conformity with State law by Article XVIII, Section 3, of the
Ohio Constitution; otherwise, the provision of these Codified Ordinances shall
control.
   (c)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (d)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (e)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
   (f)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different meetings
of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments are to
be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)
202.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)
202.08 SEPARABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of these Codified Ordinances or the
application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the
invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the section or
related sections which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
application, and to this end the provisions are separable.
(ORC 1.50)
202.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in these Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, the commission or performance
of such act, or the failure to commit or perform such act, as required, shall,
unless another penalty is provided, be deemed a minor misdemeanor and the
offender shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each
offense. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation or noncompliance occurs or continues, unless otherwise
provided.

(Ord. 152-86. Passed 8-21-86.)
204.04   CRITERIA FOR NAMING A CITY-OWNED ASSET.
   (a)   General Guidelines.
      (1)   The applicant will submit suggested name(s) to City Council for
outdoor spaces (including parks), buildings, and other structures owned by the
City where there is a strong possibility that signs for the public will be used
and references to such spaces and structures will become the common name for
them.
      (2)   The City will not name interior spaces in buildings, small
individual structures within a larger named complex that are generally not
viewed by the public except upon entry, or programs of the City that are
generally not viewed by the public except upon entry. City departments may use
naming opportunities for these interior and non-public spaces or programs.
      (3)   While the general process may be to emphasize names of local
importance, the possibility of using a non-local person, event, or feature
should not be overlooked. These categories might include explorers, astronauts,
sportsmen, political leaders, rivers, states, etc. There should be no name
duplication to existing City-owned assets. If the asset is to be named after a
person, the full name should be used unless the public persona of said person
was otherwise.
   (b)   Criteria for Naming City-owned Assets After Deceased Individuals.
      (1)   It is strongly recommended that City-owned assets be named for
deceased, not living, individuals and only after a sufficient period of time
has passed to assure that the person’s achievements, reputation and
contributions are above reproach.
      (2)   The name of any sworn public safety employee of the City of London
killed in the line of duty is eligible after the employee has been deceased for
six months.
      (3)   All other proposed names under this category shall meet the first
criterion below as well as at least one of the second and third criteria.
         A.   When the individual has been deceased for at least twelve months.
         B.   When the individual has served as a community role model or shown
exemplary leadership.
         C.   When the individual has had a positive impact on the City of
London.
   (c)   Criteria for Naming City-owned Assets After Living Individuals or
Current Organizations.
      (1)   It is strongly recommended that a City-owned asset not be named
after a living individual. An individual’s name will affect the community for a
long time; therefore, the use of an individual’s name shall carry in-depth
scrutiny. That scrutiny is often aided by the passage of time and should be
viewed from many perspectives within the community.
      (2)   Proposed name(s) will be considered only after extensive review and
the proposed name meets the first two criteria and at least one of the
remaining criteria set forth below:
         A.   When the person's achievements, reputation, and contributions are
above reproach and either:
            1.   Has served as a community role model or shown exemplary
leadership; or
            2.   Has had a positive impact on the City of London.
         B.   When the proposal is accompanied by evidence of local support for
the proposed name and such support is consistent with the purposes propounded
by the nominee. Such evidence may be in the form of letters from local
residents and administrative agencies and/or petitions containing original
signatures of local citizens.
         C.   When the nominated individual is a former employee or elected
official of the City or any of its agencies, departments, or enterprises, the
individual has been retired from active service or office for a minimum of two
years.
         D.   When private funding is involved in the acquisition,
construction, or development of the asset and 50% or more of the value of the
property is donated or contributed in-kind by the individual or organization.
         E.   When a significant amount of monetary contribution is made toward
the acquisition, construction, or development of the asset, the naming is
appropriate to the nature and prominence of the asset.
         F.   When a major contribution has been made by the individual or
organization to the enhancement of the quality of life of the community.
   (d)   Criteria for Renaming a City-owned Asset.
      (1)   Names perform an important function as they identify a particular
geographic feature, place, or area providing a high degree of stability.
Changing or renaming a City-owned asset is strongly discouraged so as not to
diminish the original name or discount the value of prior contributors. It is
recommended that efforts to change a name be subject to the most critical
examination so as not to diminish the original justification.
      (2)   Proposed name change(s) must meet all of the following three
criteria.
         A.   A history of the City-owned asset shall be included with the
application.
         B.   An economic impact review including costs, to the City and the
public, associated with a name change shall be included with the application.
         C.   When the criteria for naming a City-owned asset after a deceased,
living individual, or current organization can be applied.
   (e)   Criteria for Naming Streets.
      (1)   Streets should generally be named after people, places, events, and
things related to the City and citizens of London. When naming new streets,
strong consideration should be given to the continuation of any existing street
name to maintain street name alignment. Note however, that naming of street(s)
shall come within the purview of these criteria only in extraordinary
circumstances. General naming of streets and roads in the City are managed
through the City development review process.
      (2)   Proposed name(s) must meet one or more of the following five
criteria.
         A.   To honor and commemorate noteworthy persons associated with the
City of London.
         B.   To commemorate local and significant history, places, or culture.
         C.   To strengthen neighborhood identity.
         D.   To recognize native wildlife, flora, fauna, or natural features
related to the City of London.
         E.   To recognize communities that contribute to the diversity of the
City of London.
   (f)   Criteria for Naming Parks. Consideration should be given to names
describing the park, its geographical location and its historical or ecological
relationship indigenous to the City or County, making it easy for persons
outside the neighborhood to identify the park. While historical and natural
features should be used for parks, individuals could be recognized by naming
features within the parks, i.e. Smith Field, Jones Shelter House, subject to
approval by the Playground and Public Recreation Commission. The use of foreign
words or phrases shall be avoided if unfamiliar to the general public.

CHAPTER 209
Public Records Policy
209.01   Public records.
209.02   Record requests.
209.03   Costs for public records.
209.04   E-mail.
209.05   Failure to respond to a public records request.
209.01 PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   The City, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, defines records as
any document, whether paper, electronic (including, but not limited to, e-mail)
or other format that is created or received by, or comes under the jurisdiction
of a public office that documents the organization, functions, policies,
decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the office. All
records of the City are public unless the Ohio Revised Code specifically
exempts them from disclosure.
   (b)   As required by Ohio law, the City will organize and maintain its
records so that they are readily available for inspection and copying (See
Section
209.04 for the e-mail record policy). The City will regularly update its record
retention schedules and post them prominently.
(Ord. 115-08. Passed 3-20-08.)
209.02 RECORD REQUESTS.
   The City will evaluate each request for public records using the following
guidelines:
   (a)   Although the City does not require use of specific language to make a
request, the requester must at least identify the records requested with
sufficient clarity to allow the City to identify, retrieve, and review the
records. If the City is not clear what records are being sought, the City must
contact the requester for clarification, and should assist the requestor in
revising the request by informing the requestor of the manner in which the City
keeps its records.
   (b)   The City does not require that a requester put a records request in
writing, and does not require the requestor to provide his or her identity or
the intended use of the requested public record. The City may ask a requestor
to make the request in writing, ask for the requestor's identity and inquire
about the intended use when such information would benefit the requestor by
enhancing the ability of the City to identify, locate or deliver the public
records south by the requestor. However, the City must first disclose that a
written request is not mandatory and that the requestor may decline to reveal
the requestor's identity or the intended use.
   (c)   The City will make public records available for inspection during
regular business hours, with the exception of published holidays. The City must
make public records available for inspection promptly. The City must make
copies of public records available within a reasonable period of time. “Prompt”
and “reasonable” take into account the volume of records requested; the
proximity of the location where the records are stored; and the necessity for
any legal review of the records requested.
   (d)   (1)   The City should evaluate each request for an estimated length of
time required to gather the records. The City should immediately satisfy
routine requests for records if feasible to do so. Routine requests include,
but are not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form),
budgets, salary information, forms and applications, personnel rosters, etc. If
the request constitutes fewer than 20 pages of copies or if the records are
readily available in an electronic format that the City can e-mail or download
easily, the City should make the records available as quickly as the equipment
allows.
      (2)   The City must either satisfy each request (see division (d)(1)) or
acknowledge it in writing within three business days following receipt of the
request. If the City deems the request is significantly beyond "routine," such
as seeking a voluminous number of copies or requiring extensive research, the
acknowledgment must include the following:
         A.   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request.
         B.   An estimated cost if copies are requested.
         C.   Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure.
   (e)   The City must include an explanation, including legal authority, of
any denial of public records requested. If portions of a record are public and
portions are exempt, the City will redact the exempt portions and release the
rest. If the City makes any redactions, it must accompany each redaction with a
supporting explanation, including legal authority.
(Ord. 115-08. Passed 3-20-08.)
209.03 COSTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   The City will charge those seeking public records only the actual cost of
making copies. Such charges must be paid in advance by the requestor.
   (a)   The charge for paper copies is five cents ($0.05) per page.
   (b)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is one
dollar ($1.00) per disc.
   (c)   The City does not charge for e-mailing documents.
   (d)   Requesters may ask that the City mail documents to them. The City will
charge the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies. Such charges must
be paid in advance by the requestor.
(Ord. 115-08. Passed 3-20-08.)
209.04 E-MAIL.
   Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by the Ohio
Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the office. The City
treats e-mail in the same fashion as records in other formats and should follow
the same retention schedules.
   (a)   Records in private e-mail accounts used to conduct public business are
subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of the City must
retain their e-mails that relate to public business (see Section
209.01) and to copy them to their business e-mail accounts and/or to the
office's records custodian.
   (b)   The records custodian is to treat the e-mails from private accounts as
records of the City, filing them in the appropriate way, retaining them per
established schedules and making them available for inspection and copying in
accordance with the Public Records Act.
(Ord. 115-08. Passed 3-20-08.)
209.05 FAILURE TO RESPOND TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST.
   The City recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of failure to
properly respond to a public records request. In addition to the distrust in
government that failure to comply may cause, the City's failure to comply with
a request may result in a court ordering the City to comply with the law and to
pay the requester attorney's fees and damages.

210.01 GENERAL REVENUE SHARING GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE.
   (a)   The following General Revenue Sharing Grievance Procedure is hereby
adopted:
   Any person who feels that, because of handicap, he or she has been
discriminated against by the City, by being denied benefits of, by being
excluded from participation in, or by otherwise being discriminated against in,
any program or activity of the City, may have his or her grievance considered
in the following manner:
      (1)   Step 1. Such person shall file a written complaint of the alleged
discrimination with the Mayor, through the responsible employee appointed by
the Mayor as the contact person concerning the handicapped and named in a
public notice.
      (2)   Step 2. The Mayor shall, within five days of receipt of the
complaint, rule whether or not the complainant has or has not been
discriminated against because of a handicap. Upon rendering his or her
decision, the Mayor shall notify the complainant of his or her finding by
written letter, to be sent within ten days of the filing of the complaint. If
it is found that discrimination has taken place, due to the individual's
handicap, the Mayor shall also include in the written letter his or her
suggestion on how to remedy the discrimination and transmit the same to Council
at its next regular meeting.
      (3)   Step 3. If the complainant disagrees with the Mayor's ruling and/or
recommendation, he or she may file an appeal with Council, through the Clerk of
Council, by filing a copy of the original complaint and the Mayor's ruling and/
or recommendation.
      (4)   Step 4. At the next regular Council meeting, after the appeal has
been filed with Council, Council shall set a date for a hearing on the
complaint. Such hearing shall be not sooner than the next regular Council
meeting and not later than the second regular Council meeting which is held
after the complaint has been received by Council. Council shall notify the
complainant by certified letter or notice of the time and date of hearing.
      (5)   Step 5. Council shall render its decision within thirty days of the
hearing and shall notify the Mayor and the complainant of such decision. It
shall take a two-thirds majority vote of the members elected thereto for
Council to override the Mayor's decision as to whether discrimination did or
did not take place. In any event, Council shall decide the remedy to be taken.
   (b)   The Administrative Secretary to the Safety-Service Director is hereby
designated as the responsible employee appointed by the Mayor as the contact
person concerning the handicapped and General Revenue Sharing Grievance
Procedure.

212.01 PURPOSE; APPROVAL.
   (a)   The purpose of this policy is to provide for the prudent management of
all public funds in accordance with the stated investment philosophy of the
Auditor/Treasurer as Fiscal Officer for the City of London. The Fiscal Officer
and all staff members will adhere to this policy, Ohio R.C. Chapter 135 and all
other applicable laws and regulations at all times.
   (b)   This policy has been approved and adopted by the Fiscal Officer and a
copy hereof has been filed with the Auditor of the State of Ohio.
(Res. 213-96. Passed 12-6-96.)
212.02 INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY.
   The Fiscal Officer and all other persons who are responsible for investing
public funds have fiduciary responsibilities to the City of London and the
public. Such persons shall seek to follow an investment strategy based on the
prudent person standard. The prudent person standard requires the Fiscal
Officer and other fiduciaries to exercise the care, skill and experience that a
prudent person would use to manage his or her personal financial affairs. The
prudent person standard requires the Fiscal Officer and other fiduciaries to
seek investments which will preserve principal while maximizing income.
(Res. 213-96. Passed 12-6-96.)
212.03 INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES.
   (a)   Preservation of Principal. The primary investment objective is
preservation of principal. To meet this objective, portfolio diversification
will be established and maintained with a goal of generating portfolio income
that exceeds any losses in individual security values. It is recognized that
occasional losses are inevitable, and such possibility will be considered in
evaluating diversification decisions and investment strategy.
   (b)   Liquidity. The second investment objective is maintenance of liquidity
of assets. This objective will be met by preparing a draw schedule for
anticipated expenditures and matching investment maturities with anticipated
expenditure dates whenever possible. Once cash flow requirements have been
satisfied, maturity date selection will be determined by market conditions and
interest rate forecasts. No unmatched investment will have a maturity date of
more than five years from the settlement date. Investments made prior to
September 27, 1996, that do not have a maturity date will be kept for no more
than five years.
   No investment will be made unless, at the time the investment is made, the
Fiscal Officer reasonably believes that the investment can be held until
maturity. However, an investment may be sold prior to maturity if the Fiscal
Officer determines that such sale is prudent.
   (c)   Income Maximization. Income maximization is the third investment
objective. To accomplish this objective, the investment portfolio will be
managed with the goal of producing income returns within acceptable risk
parameters. High financial risk is unacceptable. Thus, moderate income
volatility will be permitted, but no investments which are expected to be
subject to large interest rate fluctuations will be made.
   (d)   Minimization of Cost of Services. The fourth objective is to minimize
transaction costs. To meet this objective, relationships with securities
dealers, investment bankers and other entities providing investment services
will be carefully managed to secure high quality services while simultaneously
minimizing costs.
(Res. 213-96. Passed 12-6-96.)
212.04 STANDARDS OF CONDUCT; CONTINUING EDUCATION.
   (a)   Standards of Conduct. The Fiscal Officer and staff must continually be
aware of the fiduciary nature of their responsibility for investing the public
funds under their control. All persons responsible for investment decisions, or
who are involved in the management of the City of London's assets, shall comply
with all applicable Ohio and Federal statutes and regulations, the codes of
conduct established by the National Association of Securities Dealers and the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Code of Ethics and Standards of
Professional Conduct of the Association for Investment Management and Research.
   The Fiscal Officer and staff members are prohibited from having any direct
or indirect interest in any of the investments made by the Fiscal Officer and
from receiving payment, bonuses or other compensation for investment services
in excess of their regular compensation.
   The Fiscal Officer may designate qualified staff members in his or her
office to take responsibility for executing individual investment transactions.
   (b)   Continuing Education. The Fiscal Officer will annually complete the
continuing education programs provided by the Treasurer of the State.
(Res. 213-96. Passed 12-6-96.)
212.05 QUALIFICATIONS FOR INSTITUTIONS PROVIDING INVESTMENT SERVICES.
   (a)   A copy of this policy will be provided to all securities dealers,
investment bankers and other entities doing investment business with the City
of London. Other interested parties may receive a copy upon request.
   (b)   No securities dealer, investment banker or other entity may provide
investment services to the City of London, unless its representative has
reviewed, signed and agreed on behalf of the entity to abide by the terms of
this policy. In signing this investment policy, the representative acknowledges
that the entity assumes full responsibility for recommending and making
investments in violation of any Ohio or Federal statute or regulation,
regulation or code of conduct established by the National Association of
Securities Dealers or the Securities and Exchange Commission, the terms of this
policy or any other applicable law.
    (c)   While every effort will be made to obtain appropriate discounts,
investment firms will be selected to achieve the best possible transaction
execution. The fact that a particular firm provides statistical and market
information and services will be considered in the selection process. All
investment firms selected shall be qualified to do business in the State of
Ohio, have all appropriate licenses, be in good standing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers and the
Ohio Department of Commerce's Division of Securities, and be on the list of
investment firms approved by the Fiscal Officer. A periodic review of the
investment from capital and disciplinary standing will be conducted and
necessary changes in the list of approved investment firms will be approved by
the Fiscal Officer.
   (d)   All securities orders shall be placed according to accepted investment
practices. All receipts confirming securities transactions will include the
trade date, par value, maturity, interest rate, price, yield, settlement date,
description of securities purchased, investment firm, amount due and third-
party custodial information. Confirmation receipts will be received within
three business days after the trade, and payment for investments shall be made
only be upon receipt of the securities.
   (e)   All securities dealers, investment bankers and other entities
providing investment services to the City of London are prohibited from having
any direct or indirect interests in any of the investments made by the Fiscal
Officer and from receiving payment, bonuses or other compensation for
investment services in excess of their regular compensation. As used in this
policy, "regular compensation" includes the reasonable and agreed-upon fees,
commissions and other compensation customarily associated with securities
transactions earned by outside securities dealers, investment bankers and other
entities providing investment services to the City of London.
(Res. 213-96. Passed 12-6-96.)

instrumentality, the State of Ohio or any political subdivision of the State is
not considered to be a derivative, even though it has a variable interest rate

(Ord. 113-86. Passed 4-3-86.)
   (c)   The regular work week for employees in the Fire Department shall be an

Overtime compensation shall be calculated by dividing such employee's gross
weekly pay by forty-four hours.
(Ord. 142-87. Passed 12-17-87.)
   (d)   The days of the week and the hours of each day to be worked by an

The maximum compensatory time which may be accrued by any affected employee
shall be 480 hours for an employee engaged in a public safety or seasonal

compensatory time that is not used. An employee shall be permitted to use
accrued compensatory time within a reasonable period, provided that the time
off would not unduly disrupt the operations of the particular department.
Payment for accrued compensatory time, upon termination of employment, shall be
calculated at the average regular rate of pay for the final three years of
employment or the final regular rate received by the employee, whichever is
higher. An employee's refusal to work, when requested, shall be considered
sufficient cause for suspension or dismissal.
(Ord. 118-97. Passed 2-6-97.)
260.08 ABSENCE FROM WORK; HOLIDAYS AND VACATIONS.
   The following regulations are hereby established for absence from work by
all full-time employees of the City:
   (a)   Holidays. Full-time employees shall be paid for the holidays
hereinafter set forth, but shall not be required to work on such holidays,

regularly scheduled to work the day of the holiday on the day that the holiday
falls on for a period of three months immediately preceding the holiday shall

Sunday, the Monday immediately succeeding shall be observed as the holiday.
   (b)   Vacation Leave.
      (1)   All full time non-union employees are eligible for paid vacation
leave according to the following schedule:
         A.   After one year of continuous service - 80 hours vacation;
         B.   After seven years of continuous services - 120 hours vacation;
         C.   After fourteen years of continuous services - 160 hours vacation;
         D.   After twenty-one years of continuous services - 200 hours
vacation.
      (2)   Vacation leave will be taken in a minimum of eight hours increments
unless the department head/appointing authority approves a lesser number of
hours in advance, provided however, that employees earning two weeks or more of
vacation annually, must take vacation in a forty-hour increment at least once
each calendar year. Employees who earn four weeks or more of vacation annually
must take vacation leave in forty hour increments at least twice in each
calendar year. In lieu of taking the second forty hour vacation leave,
employees earning at least four weeks of vacation leave annually may request to
be paid for forty hours of vacation leave. Such request must be submitted to
the City no later than December 13 of each calendar year. Payment shall be at
the employee's hourly rate on December 31 of the calendar year in which the
request is made. The City shall make the payment to the employee no later than
January 31 the following calendar year.
      (3)   Employees who resign or retire are entitled to compensation, at
their current rate of pay, for any earned but unused vacation leave at time of
separation. To be eligible, the employee must have given two weeks notice.
      (4)   Request for vacation must be made by March 1 of any calendar year.
In such event, employee's seniority and operation considerations shall be used
in determining which employee shall be entitled to the vacation time. After
this date employees must submit requests for vacation leave of forty hours or
more at least fourteen days in advance. Vacations will then be granted on a
first come first serve basis with operation considerations.
(Ord. 166-07. Passed 10-18-07.)

six-tenths hours per eighty hours in an active pay status with a maximum
accrual of four and six-tenths hours per pay period.
   (d)   Leave Without Pay. Absence without proper authorization or approval
shall be considered sufficient cause for suspension or dismissal. Leave without

year.

payment to employees shall be made in lieu of unused vacation or sick leave,
except when an employee is permanently separated from employment and in special
circumstances when the director of each department and/or the Board of Public
Utilities determines that it would be in the best interest of the City. No such
payment shall be made to an employee dismissed for cause. Any employee who has
accumulated 1,120 hours of sick leave as of November 1 of each year shall be

exchange for reduction of three weeks of unused sick leave. A request for such
exchange may be made only once each calendar year and must be submitted not

half personal days off with pay during each year of employment. Such days shall
be requested in advance in the same manner as vacation days. Employees who
desire to use a personal day in December must submit a request no later than
November 30. If the personal days cannot be scheduled due to the operational
needs of the Department, the employee shall be paid for such days not used in
the first pay period after January 15. The parties shall make a reasonable
effort to cooperate to schedule the personal leave days. Any time periods set
forth in this Section may be waived with the mutual consent of the parties.

290.01 REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS OF CONFINEMENT.
   (a)   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04,
753.16, 2301.56, 2929.15 and 2947.19, which are incorporated herein by
reference, any person who is convicted of an offense other than a minor
misdemeanor and is sentenced to confinement in the County Jail shall reimburse
the City for its expenses incurred by reason of the offender's confinement,
including, but not limited to, expenses relating to the provision of food,
clothing and shelter. Such reimbursement shall include expenses for
preconviction confinement when credit for such confinement is credited against
the term of imprisonment.
   (b)   The amount of the reimbursement required by this section shall be
determined by the court after a hearing held pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.15 or
any subsequent amendment thereto. The amount of the reimbursement ordered by
the court shall not exceed the actual costs of the confinement.
   The court shall consider all factors that affect the offender's financial
ability to make reimbursement to the City. When the Municipal Court makes a
reimbursement determination pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.15, a judgment entry and
order of reimbursement shall be filed and entered that sets forth the total
amount of reimbursement due to the City, and the reimbursement schedules and
methods.
   (c)   This section shall not apply to offenders that the court finds to be
indigent.
   (d)   Funds that are reimbursed to the City pursuant to this section shall
be paid into the General Fund of the City Treasury.
   (e)   If an offender does not pay to the City the reimbursement ordered by
the court pursuant to this section, the City Law Director may collect the claim
or institute an appropriate civil action in the name of the City, either in the
Madison County Municipal Court or the Madison County Court of Common Pleas, to
recover from the convict the reimbursement for the expenses of confinement as
determined by the court. If an action is filed, it shall be brought not later
than one year after the person is released from incarceration. If it is deemed
in the best interests of the City, the City Law Director is authorized to
compromise and settle such claim in an amount less than the total reimbursement
due to the City. If an offender does not comply with the reimbursement
determination for expenses of confinement made by the court, vexatiously,
wantonly and obdurately, and in any civil action on behalf of the City to
recover from the convict the reimbursement for the expenses of his or her
confinement, the City Law Director or his or her representative shall request
an award of attorney fees as part of the costs of the proceedings. The award of
such attorney fees shall be paid into the General Fund of the City Treasury.

convicted of the violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties
provided by law, may impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may

offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the

(R.C. § 4549.081(C))
414.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more State routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic- control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
414.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start
to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians
facing a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not
enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(ORC 4511.13)
414.04 SIGNAL TO CONTROL LANE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(ORC 4511.131)
414.05 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"don't walk," or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.
(ORC 4511.14)
414.06 FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS (REPEALED).
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section 414.06 was repealed as part of the 2012 updating and

or signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or hides from
view or interferes with the effectiveness of any traffic-control device or any
railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit, upon any highway any traffic sign or signal bearing
thereon any commercial advertising. This section does not prohibit either the
erection upon private property adjacent to highways of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for traffic-
control devices, or the erection upon private property of traffic- control
devices by the owner of real property in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.211 and
4511.432.
      (2)   Every prohibited sign, signal, marking, or device is a public
nuisance, and the authority having jurisdiction over the highway may remove the
same or cause it to be removed.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
(ORC 4511.16)

with a manhole cover.
   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (a)(1) or (3) of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third
degree. If a violation of division (a)(1) or (3) of this section creates a risk
of physical harm to any person, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If a violation of division (a)(1) or (3) of this section causes
serious physical harm to property that is owned, leased, or controlled by a
State or local authority, the offender is guilty of a felony to be prosecuted
under appropriate State law.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (a)(2) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within
one year of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever
violates division (a)(2) of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
fourth degree. If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has

      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left

right-of- way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;

device.
   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;

      (2)   Nothing in division (b)(1) of this section requires a driver of a
slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (c)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic-control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or

distance ahead to permit the overtaking and passing to be completely made
without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken. In every event, the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable, and
in the event the passing movement involves the use of a lane authorized for the
traffic approaching from the opposite direction, before coming within 200 feet

      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal

Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definitions. As used in this section:
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device” means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person
if convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)
(c), (d), or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two- hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
         “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under
State law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the
person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a
drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).
         If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.
or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state
O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased
penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
         (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
         If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person’s initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under this section,
and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test
results indicate is present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.
(ORC 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension Effective Immediately. A suspension of a person's
driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial Appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal OVI ordinance, or for being in physical control of
a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
division (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver's or occupational driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19 as a result of the

sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the 60-day period following the date of sentencing, the court may
impose an alternative sentence as specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(3) that
includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous
alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.
         B.   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by Ohio

must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of
the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).

distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial

(c)(3)C. of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court, neither the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept any
application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the
registration of the vehicle.
   (f)   This section does not apply to motor vehicle rental dealers or motor
vehicle leasing dealers, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4549.65.
   (g)   Evidence of a conviction of, plea of guilty to, or adjudication as a
delinquent child for a violation of this section shall not be admissible as
evidence in any civil action that involves the offender or delinquent child who
is the subject of the conviction, plea, or adjudication and that arises from
the wrongful entrustment of a motor vehicle.

   (a)   The operator of a motor vehicle shall display the operator's driver's
license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver's
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, whoever
violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Sections
698.02,
698.03 or Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Section
698.02(d) or Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding Section
698.02(f)(1)B.1. and Ohio R.C. 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the offender may be fined up
to one thousand dollars ($1,000); and notwithstanding Section
698.02(e)(1)C. and Ohio R.C. 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered
pursuant to Section
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up
to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community
service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section,
Ohio R.C. 4507.35, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

RESPONSIBILITY OR IN VIOLATION OF LICENSE RESTRICTIONS. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section 436.07 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating and

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(1) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(2) of this section. The
person charged with a violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section
may offer evidence to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (4)   A.   Whoever violates division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section is

offender a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in Ohio
R.C. 4510.02(A)(7).
         B.   1.   Except as provided in division (a)(4)B.2. or (a)(4)B.3. of
this section, the court, in addition to any other penalty that it imposes on
the offender and if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
            2.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to two violations of this section, or any combination of
two violations of this section, Ohio R.C. 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or of a

state.
      (5)   Any order for immobilization and impoundment under this section
shall be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.233 and 4507.02, as
applicable. The court shall not release a vehicle from immobilization ordered
under this section unless the court is presented with current proof of
financial responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order
from the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar
shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration
of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

      (2)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (b)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section is guilty of
driving under suspension and shall be punished as provided in division (b)(3)A.

pursuant to Section
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up

service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
         B.   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (b)
(1) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree, and the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial

and who, during the suspension, operates any motor vehicle upon any public
roads and highways is guilty of driving under a twelve-point suspension, a
misdemeanor of the first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to a
minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the first three days
of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.
(ORC 4510.037(J))
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver's
or commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

698.02(e)(1)C. and Ohio R.C. 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered
pursuant to Section
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up
to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community
service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of
this section or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under division (c)(2) of this section, if
within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender's license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender's
driver license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02 (A)(7).

   (c)   (1)   No court shall impose an alternative sentence of house arrest
with electronic monitoring under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on
the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.

      (1)   When permitted as specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.021, if the court
grants limited driving privileges during a suspension imposed under this
section, the privileges shall be granted on the additional condition that the
offender must display restricted license plates, issued under Ohio R.C.

in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).
      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver's license under this section
shall be concurrent with any period of suspension or disqualification under
Ohio R.C. 3123.58 or 4506.16. No person who is disqualified for life from

driver's license under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period for which the
commercial driver's license was suspended under this section, and no person

         A.   A violation of a municipal ordinance, law of another state, or
law of the United States that is substantially equivalent to division (a) of

section to be secured in a child restraint system, is being transported in a
motor vehicle, other than a taxicab or public safety vehicle as defined in Ohio
R.C. 4511.01 or a vehicle that is regulated under Ohio R.C. 5104.015, that is
required by the United States Department of Transportation to be equipped with
seat belts at the time of manufacture or assembly, the operator of the motor
vehicle shall have the child properly secured in accordance with the

of this section to be secured in a child restraint system or booster seat, is
being transported in a motor vehicle, other than a taxicab or public safety
vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4511.01, that is required by the United States
Department of Transportation to be equipped with seat belts at the time of
manufacture or assembly, the operator of the motor vehicle shall have the child
properly restrained either in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
in a child restraint system that meets Federal motor vehicle safety standards
or in an occupant restraining device as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.263.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section has been
or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or
summons for a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section or causing the
arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation of division
(c) or (d) of this section, and absent another violation of law, a law
enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual inspection of a motor
vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not be used for the purpose
of determining whether a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed.
   (f)   The Director of Public Safety shall adopt such rules as are necessary
to carry out this section.
   (g)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a
child restraint system, a booster seat or in an occupant restraining device as
required in this section is not negligence imputable to the child, is not
admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to
be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the operator of the motor
vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section, and is not
admissible as evidence in any criminal action involving the operator of the
motor vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
   (h)   This section does not apply when an emergency exists that threatens
the life of any person operating or occupying a motor vehicle that is being
used to transport a child who otherwise would be required to be restrained
under this section. This section does not apply to a person operating a motor
vehicle who has an affidavit signed by a physician licensed to practice in this
State under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4731 or a chiropractor licensed to practice in
this State under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4734 that states that the child who
otherwise would be required to be restrained under this section has a physical
impairment that makes use of a child restraint system, booster seat or an
occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   (1)   Whoever violates division (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section
shall be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a
motor vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system,
booster seat or occupant restraining device as required by this section that
occurred at the same time, on the same day and at the same location is deemed
to be a single violation of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (j)(1)B. of this
section, the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not
less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars
($75.00).
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a violation of division (a), (b),(c) or (d) of this section or of a
State law or municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent any of those
divisions, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
      (2)   All fines imposed pursuant to division (j)(1) of this section shall
be forwarded to the State Treasurer for deposit in the Child Highway Safety
Fund created by Ohio R.C. 4511.81(I).

person included in the database under division (c)(5) of this section is not
required to have the affidavit obtained in accordance with division (c)(3) of
this section in their possession while operating or occupying an automobile.
      (6)   A physician or chiropractor who issues an affidavit for the
purposes of division (c)(3) or (c)(4) of this section is immune from civil
liability arising from any injury or death sustained by the person who was
issued the affidavit due to the failure of the person to wear an occupant

misconduct.
      (7)   The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall adopt rules in accordance
with R.C. Chapter 119 establishing a process for a person to be included in the
database under division (c)(5) of this section. The information provided and

   (d)   Officers Not Permitted to Stop Cars to Determine Violation.
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law enforcement
officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on any street
or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of determining whether a
violation of division (b) of this section has been or is being committed or for
the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or summons for the violation or
for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for the
violation. No law enforcement officer shall view the interior or visually

to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of division (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section or
the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff's failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates division (b)(2) of this section shall be subject
to the penalty set forth in Section

      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
division (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates division (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

of improper replacement of a motor vehicle air bag, a misdemeanor of the first
degree on a first offense. On each subsequent offense, or if the violation
results in serious physical harm to an individual, the person is guilty of a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (c) of this section is a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (3)   Each manufacture, importation, installation, reinstallation, sale,
or offer for sale in violation of this section shall constitute a separate and
distinct violation.

440.01 LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
Ohio R.C. 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
            4.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         B.   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a
vehicle, are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules
establishing requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially
similar to the requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:
2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the Municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in Ohio R.C.
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34) (Adopting Ordinance)
   (b)   Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)
   (c)   Permission for Moving Overweight Vehicles. The Safety-Service Director
of the Municipality, upon application in writing by the owner or person having
charge thereof, may grant permission for the moving of vehicles, objects and
structures in excess of the limits set forth in this section and Section
440.02. Such permission shall be in writing and the Director may grant the same
subject to such conditions and restrictions as in his or her judgment are
necessary for the preservation and protection of streets, bridges and culverts.
(Ord. 1569. Passed 6-4-69.)
   (d)   Local Streets Generally. 
      (1)   No person shall drive or operate any vehicle designed to be used
for the conveyance, transfer or delivery of freight, merchandise or other
substances and materials usually hauled in such vehicles, exceeding a gross
weight of 10,000 pounds, including the weight of the vehicle, whether loaded or
unloaded, upon any street or other public place in the Municipality, except on
designated and marked State and Federal routes, whether temporary or permanent.
However, when the loaded contents of such vehicle exceeding such weights are
for delivery to, or such vehicle is called to remove merchandise or other
material from, any business, house or other place not located on such State or
Federal routes, then such vehicle may be driven and operated on the streets and
other public places not designated or marked as a State or Federal route, but
only between the place of delivery or removal of freight and merchandise and
the nearest intersecting State or Federal route.
      (2)   The operators of such vehicles shall be required, upon request of
any member of the Police Department or other person authorized by the
Municipality, to give full and true information as to the route they are
following, the means of the consignor and consignee, the place of delivery or
removal, and the location of any consignment being hauled or goods being
removed.
   (e)   Streets Other Than State or Federal Routes. The drivers of all such
vehicles exceeding such weights, entering the Municipality upon a street other
than a State or Federal route, shall proceed immediately, by the shortest way
possible, to the nearest State or Federal route leading in the direction in

452.05 WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper,
upon notification to the chief of such action and of the location of the place
of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, including an abandoned
junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief
of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However, when such
a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be ordered into
storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief or state highway patrol trooper shall allow
the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the removal
of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief or state
highway patrol trooper. If the chief or state highway patrol trooper determines
that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of time, the
chief or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the chief shall designate
the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
division (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle by
a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity of
the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the presentation, shall issue a salvage
certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (g)   (1)   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor vehicle,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, on private property for more than 48
consecutive hours without the permission of the person having the right to the
possession of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right-of-way of any road or highway for 48 consecutive hours or longer, without
notification to the Police Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in
such place.
      (2)   For purposes of this division (g), the fact that a vehicle has been
so left without permission or notification is prima facie evidence of
abandonment.
      (3)   Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions
of other ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles
on streets, highways, public property, or private property within the
Municipality.
(Ord. 122-94. Passed 3-17-94.)
   (h)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a
parking infraction and shall be subject to the provisions of
Chapter 454.
452.06 PARKING PROHIBITIONS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY; PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation, upon complaint of any person adversely affected, may order into
storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or private
agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the chief
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to division (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle
only in accordance with division (d) of this section.
      (4)   As used in this section, “private residential property” means
private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than
three separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. The
phrase does not include any private property on which is located one or more
structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by two or more
persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in the structure
or structures.
   (b)   (1)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been
ordered into storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section arrives after
the motor vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual
removal from the property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator
oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that the chief orders
into storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section. The record shall
include an entry for each such motor vehicle that identifies the motor
vehicle’s license number, make, model, and color, the location from which it
was removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the
person from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it
has been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under division (a)
(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both of
the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 or, if the vehicle

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
R.C. § 4513.611.

(d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage under division (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any personal items
from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
      (4)   For purposes of division (d)(3) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (5)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
division (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for 30 days, the
procedures established by R.C. §§ 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 4513.60)
   (h)   Private Tow-away Zones.
      (1)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away
zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         A.   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;

If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow- away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the
sign.
         B.   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this division
(h) is taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with
all of the following:
            1.   It is located within 25 linear miles of the location of the
private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to a
place of storage within 25 linear miles.

            3.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly
scheduled route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public

as a private tow-away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this division (h). The vehicle owner and
the operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by

unlicensed tow truck operator.
         C.   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
      (3)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (h)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.
Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
      (4)   A.   Prior to towing a vehicle under division (h)(2) of this
section, a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many
photographs as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on
private property in violation of a private tow-away zone established under

         B   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under division (h)
(2) of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more
than two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone,
unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two
hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is
not within the power of the towing service.
      (5)   A.   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under division
(h)(2) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of removing the

            1.   The records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles;
            2.   The records of any vendor or vendors, approved by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles, that are capable of providing real-time access to

         B.   The towing service or storage facility may search the National
Motor Vehicle Title Information System in order to determine the state in which
the vehicle is titled. The entity that provides the record of the owner and any
lienholder under this division shall ensure that such information is provided
in a timely manner.
         C.   Subject to division (h)(6)F. of this section, the towing service
or storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
            1.   Within five business days after the applicable entity provides

(Ord. 193-88. Passed 11-17-88; Ord. 219-21. Passed 11-18-21.)
454.02 DECRIMINALIZATION; IMPOUNDMENT AND IMMOBILIZATION OF VEHICLE.
   (a)   Except as provided in Section
454.06(e), the commission of a parking infraction shall not be considered a
criminal offense for any purpose. A person who commits a parking infraction
shall not be arrested as a result of such act. All parking infractions shall be
dealt with in accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   A vehicle found standing or parked in violation of any of the sections
that constitute a parking infraction, as provided in Section
454.01(e), is subject to impoundment or immobilization by law enforcement
officers of the City or their agents, irrespective of whether or not the
vehicle is impeding or hindering the movement of other vehicles. The owner of a
vehicle impounded pursuant to this chapter shall be liable for impoundment fees
and storage charges as provided in Section
404.07(b).
   (c)   A vehicle so impounded or immobilized shall be released to the owner
upon the owner' s presenting a valid certificate of title to the vehicle to the
Violations Clerk of the Parking Violations Bureau and upon the owner's either
paying the fine due on the parking infraction that led to the impoundment or

454.03 PARKING TICKET; SERVICE AND LIABILITY.
   (a)   The parking ticket form adopted in Section
454.08 shall be used by law enforcement officers in all cases in which a person

ticket shall be the summons and complaint for the purposes of this chapter.
   (b)   A law enforcement officer who issues a parking ticket for a parking
infraction shall complete the ticket by identifying the parking infraction
charge, recording the license plate number and the type, make or model of the
vehicle, and indicating the date, time and place of the charged parking
infraction. The officer shall sign the ticket, affirm the facts it contains and
file a copy with the Violations Clerk. If the operator of the vehicle is
present, the officer shall also record on the ticket the name of the operator
(in a space provided on the ticket for identification of the offender) and then
shall personally serve the parking ticket upon the operator. If the operator of
the vehicle is not present, the officer shall insert the word "owner" in the
space provided on the ticket for identification of the offender and then shall
constructively serve the parking ticket upon the owner of the vehicle by
affixing the ticket to the vehicle in a conspicuous place. Constructive service
of a parking ticket upon an owner of a vehicle by such affixation or by the
procedure described in subsection (d) hereof has the same force and effect as
if the parking ticket were personally served on both the owner and the operator
of the vehicle at the time of the violation, and potentially subjects both the
owner and the operator of the vehicle, whose act or omission resulted in the
parking infraction, if different, to the same fine and the same penalties, fees
and costs for failure to timely answer or to appear, if a hearing is requested.
   (c)   The original of a parking ticket issued pursuant to this section or
any true copy thereof shall be considered a record kept in the ordinary course
of business of the City and of the law enforcement agency whose officer issued
it, and shall be prima-facie evidence of the facts it contains.
   (d)   An operator of a vehicle who is not the owner of the vehicle, but who
operates it with the express or implied permission of the owner, is the agent
of the owner for purposes of the receipt of a parking ticket served in
accordance with this section. Personal service of a parking ticket upon the
operator, in accordance with this section, constitutes constructive service
upon the owner for purposes of this chapter. The operator of a rented or leased
vehicle whose act or omission resulted in an alleged parking infraction shall
not be considered to be an agent of the owner if the owner is engaged in the
business of renting and leasing vehicles pursuant to a written rental or lease
agreement and if the owner follows the procedures set forth in Section
454.07.
   (e)   Except as provided in Section
454.07, when a parking ticket is issued for a parking infraction and is served
pursuant to this section, the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission
resulted in the parking infraction for which the ticket was issued and the
owner of the vehicle involved in the parking infraction, if different, are
jointly liable for the parking infraction and for any fine, penalty, fee or
cost arising out of the parking infraction. Any owner of a vehicle who pays any
fine, penalty, fee or cost imposed for a parking infraction pursuant to this
chapter may recover the amount so paid from the operator of the vehicle whose
act or omission resulted in the parking infraction.
   (f)   No person who is served with a parking ticket pursuant to this section
shall be arrested as a result of the commission of a parking infraction.
(Ord. 193-88. Passed 11-17-88.)
454.04 PARKING VIOLATIONS BUREAU.
   (a)   A Parking Violations Bureau is hereby established. The Bureau shall be
administered and operated in the manner and form set forth in this chapter and
under the supervision and control of the Safety-Service Director, who may
delegate the responsibility for operating the Bureau in such a manner as he or
she deems appropriate. The Director shall establish the Bureau and appoint
qualified employees to administer it. The Director is hereby authorized to
adopt rules and regulations for the operation thereof. The Bureau has
jurisdiction over each parking infraction that occurs within the City.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, each parking
infraction that occurs within the jurisdiction of the Bureau and the
enforcement of such parking infraction shall be handled pursuant to and
governed by this chapter.
   (b)   The fines, penalties, fees and costs established for a parking
infraction shall be collected, retained and disbursed by the Violations Clerk
if the parking infraction out of which the fines, penalties, fees and costs
arose occurred within the jurisdiction of the Bureau.
(Ord. 193-88. Passed 11-17-88.)
454.05 ANSWERS TO CHARGE; JUDGMENTS.

ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction may answer the charge by

   (d)   If a person who is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction fails to timely answer
the charge, as provided in subsection (a) hereof, the Bureau shall issue the
proper notification of infraction, pursuant to Section
454.06, and proceed according to such section. Failure to timely answer a
charge may result in the imposition of an additional penalty of five dollars
($5.00).
(Ord. 221-97. Passed 11-6-97.)
   (e)   The issuance of a parking ticket, the filing of or failure to file an
answer by a person personally or constructively served with the ticket, the

not the owner of the vehicle, as determined from the records of the Ohio Bureau
of Motor Vehicles, a notification of infraction shall also be sent to the owner
at his or her most recent address appearing in such records.
      (2)   If the person who fails to answer was the owner of the vehicle and
was constructively served with the parking ticket, a notification of infraction

records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles.
   (b)   A notification of infraction shall be sent by first class mail within
twelve months after the expiration of the time specified in Section
454.05 for the making of an answer and shall contain all of the following:

offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two

         A.   The phrase “offense is directly related to the misconduct in
office of a public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of
Ohio R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A),

municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code
sections listed in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.
   (d)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal

commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation

      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in

   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

   (i)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred

have occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
   (l)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section that
took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03
committed on and after July 16, 2015, and apply to a violation of either of

applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.
(R.C. § 2901.13)
606.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.” Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.” Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.” Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.” A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
606.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
606.11 ATTEMPTS.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an
attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to
hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
State law. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.

      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
606.13 SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (a)   As used in this section, “residence” has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (b)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (c)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.

the death of a person shall fail to report the death immediately to a physician
or advanced practice registered nurse whom the person knows to be treating the

nurse-patient relationship is not a ground for excluding evidence regarding a
person’s burn injury or the cause of the burn injury in any judicial proceeding

      (3)   Disclosure of the information would amount to revealing a news
source, privileged under R.C. § 2739.04 or 2739.12.

member of the ordained clergy of an organized religious body of a confidential
communication made to that member of the clergy in that member’s capacity as a
member of the clergy by a person seeking the aid or counsel of that member of
the clergy.
      (5)   Disclosure would amount to revealing information acquired by the

program of treatment or services for persons with drug dependencies or persons
in danger of drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a
hospital, clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider
whose alcohol and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to R.C. §
5119.36.
      (6)   Disclosure would amount to revealing information acquired by the
actor in the course of the actor’s duties in connection with a bona fide

any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.

regardless of whether the person or child aided ultimately is apprehended for,

enforcement agency, or a laboratory established by or under the authority of an
institution of higher education that has its main campus in this State and that
is accredited by the Association of American Universities or the North Central
Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, primarily for the purpose of
providing scientific service to law enforcement agencies, and signed by the
person performing the analysis, stating that the substance that is the basis of
the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as
to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it contains any
amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of unit
dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or the
existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,
or substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report
from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as
described in this division that is signed by the person performing the
analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the alleged offense
have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content,
weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the
content, identity, and weight of the substances.
      (2)   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by
the signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that the
signer is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report and that performing
the analysis is a part of the signer's regular duties, and giving an outline of
the signer's education, training, and experience for performing an analysis of
materials included under this section. The signer shall attest that
scientifically accepted tests were performed with due caution, and that the
evidence was handled in accordance with established and accepted procedures
while in the custody of the laboratory.
   (b)   The prosecuting attorney shall serve a copy of the report on the
attorney of record for the accused, or on the accused if the accused has no
attorney, prior to any proceeding in which the report is to be used against the
accused other than at a preliminary hearing or grand jury proceeding where the
report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (c)   The report shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents,
identity, and weight or the existence and number of unit dosages of the
substance if the accused or the accused's attorney demands the testimony of the
person signing the report, by serving the demand upon the prosecuting attorney,
within seven days from the accused or the accused's attorney's receipt of the
report. The time may be extended by a trial judge in the interests of justice.

substances that are, the basis of the alleged violation preserved for the
benefit of independent analysis performed by a laboratory analyst employed by
the accused person, or, if the accused is indigent, by a qualified laboratory
analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused's analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's analyst with the sample
portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial. If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused's analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused's attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused's privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis
and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings, or
opinions concerning the identity of the substance or substances subject to the
analysis.

any person who is accused of a violation of this chapter or Ohio R.C. Chapters
2925 or 3719 that involves a bulk amount of a controlled substance, or any
multiple thereof, or who is accused of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 or a

the prosecuting attorney, to have a laboratory analyst of the accused's choice,
or, if the accused is indigent, a qualified laboratory analyst appointed by the
court, present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis
of the alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

pay to the state, municipal, or county law enforcement agencies that handled
the investigation and prosecution all of the costs that the state, municipal
corporation, or county reasonably incurred in having tests performed under this
section or Ohio R.C. 2925.51 or in any other manner on any substance that was
the basis of, or involved in, the offense to determine whether the substance
contained any amount of a controlled substance if the results of the tests
indicate that the substance tested contained any controlled substance. No court
shall order an offender under this section to pay the costs of tests performed
on a substance if the results of the tests do not indicate that the substance
tested contained any controlled substance. The court shall hold a hearing to
determine the amount of costs to be imposed under this section. The court may
hold the hearing as part of the sentencing hearing for the offender.

opportunity to be publicly heard in person or by counsel in his or her own
defense. Any such removal shall be final.

626.08 PROCEDURES AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Any person subjected to an unlawful housing practice may file with the
Fair Housing Board, within 360 days of the alleged violation, a complaint in
writing, sworn to or affirmed, which shall state the name and address of the
person alleged to have committed the violation complained of and the
particulars thereof and such other information as may be required by the Board.
The Board may also corroborate or initiate complaints on the basis of testing
carried out by its staff or volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (b)   Upon the filing of a complaint, the Executive Secretary of the Board
shall make such investigation as he or she deems appropriate to ascertain facts
and issues. If the Executive Secretary determines that there are reasonable
grounds to believe that a violation of this chapter has occurred, he or she
shall attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of initial conference and
persuasion with all interested parties and such representatives as the parties
may choose to assist them. Conciliation conferences shall be informal and
nothing said or done during such initial conferences shall be made public by
the Board or by any member of the Board or its staff unless the parties agree
thereto in writing.
   (c)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to
writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties,
which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not constitute an
admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent agreements shall
be signed on behalf of the Board by its Chairman.
   (d)   The Board may seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio Real Estate
Board or the Ohio Civil Rights Commission in any investigation under this
chapter.
   (e)   If the Executive Secretary determines that the complaint lacks
reasonable grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he or she
shall so inform the Board and the Board may, at its discretion, dismiss such
complaint or order such further investigation as may be necessary. However, the
Board shall not dismiss such complaint without first affording the complainant
an opportunity to appear before the Board.
   (f)   If the Executive Secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a
violation of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties
have in good faith attempted such conciliations or fails to effect an informal
conciliation agreement or a formal consent agreement, or determines that a
complaint is not susceptible of conciliation, he or she shall notify the Board
immediately and the Board shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to
determine whether or not a violation of this chapter has been committed. The
Board shall serve upon the respondent a statement of charges and a summons, and
shall serve upon all interested parties a notice of the time and place of the
hearing. The respondent or his or her authorized counsel may file such
statements with the Board prior to the hearing date as he or she deems
necessary in support of his or her position. The hearing shall be open to the
public, except that the respondent may request, in writing, a private hearing.
The determination of such request shall be at the discretion of the Board. The
hearing shall be held not less than fifteen days after service of the statement
of charges and summons. The summons so issued must be signed by two members of
the Board, and the issuance of such summons requires the attendance of named
persons and the production of relevant documents and records. The failure to
comply with a summons constitutes a violation of this chapter. The interested
parties may, at their option, appear before the Board in person or by a duly
authorized representative and may have the assistance of an attorney. The
parties may present testimony and evidence and the right to cross-examine
witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony and evidence shall be given under
oath or by affirmation. The Executive Secretary shall keep a full record of the
hearing, which record shall be public and open to inspection by any person.
Upon request by a principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish
such party a copy of the hearing record, if any, at such cost as the Board
deems appropriate.
   (g)   If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board determines upon the
preponderance of the evidence, that the person complained against has violated
this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Director of Law in
executive session, state its findings to and cause the Director to prepare and
issue an order under Board directive requiring the person complained against to
cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take such affirmative action
as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter, with notice that if the Board
determines that the person complained against has not, after fifteen calendar
days following service of the Board's order, complied with the order, the Board
will recertify the matter to the Director for enforcement.
   (h)   Upon recertification to the Director of Law for enforcement, he or she
shall seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the
Board before a court of competent jurisdiction. In any such proceeding, where
the court determines that there has been a violation of this chapter, the court
shall award compensatory damages and, where appropriate, punitive damages,
along with attorney fees. The court may also order such other relief as it
deems necessary or appropriate.
   (i)   If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board determines, upon the
preponderance of the evidence of the record, that the person complained against
has not violated this chapter, the Board shall state and publish its findings
and issue an order dismissing the complaint.

sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than the day or time specified
on its license, the charitable organization may apply in writing to the
Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to R.C. § 2915.08(J). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than

violation of this section and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of R.C. § 2903.13, or any substantially similar municipal ordinance,
based on the same conduct involving the same victim that was the basis of the

vehicle or any pedestrian using such street or sidewalk, or any other person.
      (4)   Such owner shall immediately remove any obstruction to a public
street, alley, or sidewalk in the event that a tree and/or branches fall and
cause such obstruction. In the event that the City of London Street Department

public health, the municipality shall cause a written notice to be served on
the owner and, if different, on the lessee, agent or tenant having charge of
such land, notifying him or her that litter is on the land and that it must be
collected and removed within 15 days after the service of the notice.
      (4)   If the owner or other person having charge of the land has a known
address, the notice shall be sent to his or her address by certified mail. If

building or construction permit or license, a municipal permit or license, a

such noxious weeds to be cut and destroyed or such litter removed and may
employ the necessary labor to perform the task. All expenses incurred shall be
paid out of any money in the Treasury of the municipality not otherwise
appropriated.
   (d)   Assessment of Costs. Whenever the municipality proceeds under division
(a) or (c) of this section, the municipality shall give five days notice, by
certified mail, to the owner of the land to pay the cost incurred by the
municipality in removing the weeds or litter, or in trimming the trees, which
notice shall be accompanied by a statement of such cost. If such owner has no
known address and has been previously served pursuant to division (b) of this
section by publication, no notice required pursuant to this division need be
given. If the cost has not been paid within 30 days after the mailing of such
notice, then the municipality shall make a written return to the County Auditor
of its action with a statement of the charges for its service, the amount paid
for labor and a proper description of the premises. These amounts shall be
entered upon the tax duplicate, be a lien upon such land from the date of the
entry and be collected as other taxes and returned to the municipality with the
General Fund.

guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

672.03 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially similar municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02,
2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses,
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender previously has been convicted of a theft offense, a violation of

   (c)   A motor vehicle identification license plate as prescribed by R.C. §
4503.22, a temporary motor vehicle license registration as prescribed by R.C. §
4503.182, or any comparable temporary motor vehicle license registration as
prescribed by the applicable law of another state or the United States;
   (d)   A blank form for a certificate of title or a manufacturer's or

relevant information.
      (2)   After receiving a notice demanding the return of the rented
property as provided in division (c) of this section, the rentee neither
returned the rented property nor made arrangements acceptable with the renter
to return the rented property.
   (c)   To establish that a rentee has an intent to commit theft of rented
property or rental services under division (b)(2) above, a renter may issue a
notice to a rentee demanding the return of the rented property. The renter
shall mail the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
rentee at the address the rentee gave when the rental contract was executed, or
to the rentee at the last address the rentee or the rentee's agent furnished in
writing to the renter.
   (d)   A demand for the return of the rented property is not a prerequisite
for the prosecution of a rentee for theft of rented property or rental
services. The evidence specified in division (b) above does not constitute the
only evidence that may be considered as evidence of intent to commit theft of
rented property or rental services.

698.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Dangerous offender" means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   "Repeat offender" means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or
more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent felony drug
abuse offense;
      (5)   Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or
degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offenses, or minor
misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
         (ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
666.99 or
698.03 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
         (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in Ohio R.C.
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. 307.932. In all
other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including
but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, and other contagious diseases. The
person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who
refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, or another contagious
disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         C.   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor of
the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or fourth
degree;
         D.   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         E.   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         F.   A term of basic probation supervision;
         G.   A term of monitored time;
         H.   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         I.   A curfew term;
         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender's privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender's motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator's license, or any other related sanction;
         N.    A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political subdivision
may bring an action to do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
         (R.C. § 2929.28)
698.03 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04 ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand

      (5)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a
prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

698.06 MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section 698.06 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating and
revision of these Codified Ordinances because substantially identical State law
(Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
698.07 SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
similar to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially similar.

820.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Community antenna system", "CATV system" or "wired city" means any
facility which originates or transmits or distributes electronic or other
signals to subscribers or others for which a fee or fees may be charged,
including video and/or audio signals from operating television stations and AM
and FM radio stations, but not limited to such signals. Specifically included
as permissible are services, transmissions, distributions and/or programming
originated by or on the system or by others with the system's consent.
      "Community antenna system" shall not be applied to the following
facilities:
      (1)   A facility servicing fewer than fifty subscribers;
      (2)   A facility servicing one or more rental complexes, including
apartments and/or townhouses and/or single dwellings under the same ownership,
control or management, and including commercial establishments located on the
premises of such a rental complex or complexes;
      (3)   A facility servicing individual hotels or motels or more than one
hotel and/ or motel under the same ownership, control or management; or
      (4)   A facility owned and operated by a nonprofit organization, with
service limited to the premises of such nonprofit organization.
   (b)   "Operator" means any person, partnership, firm, company, corporation
or association operating a community antenna system and holding a permit
granted by an ordinance of Council to operate the same within the corporate
limits of the City.
   (c)   "Transmission and distribution", "carriage and/or utilization" and
"origination" means methods, techniques and procedures in the operation of a
community antenna system as authorized by the Federal Communications
Commission, either by virtue of enabling rules and regulations or in the
absence of prohibiting rules and regulations.
(Ord. 123-76. Passed 6-17-76.)
820.02 PHILOSOPHY OF COUNCIL; OBJECTIVES.
   Considering the concept of the "wired city" to be valid and believing that
it will not only become a reality in the foreseeable future but will require a
combination of cable and off-the-air transmission for the ultimate in services,
the philosophy of Council is as follows:
   (a)   In setting forth the guidelines for the operation of CATV, this for
all practical purposes being the beginning of a "wired city", insofar as
Council may do so without being in conflict with rules and regulations of the
Federal Communications Commission, it is the intent to make possible the
offering of a variety of services, while at the same time affording the City
and its residents maximum protection.
   (b)   In these guidelines is recognition of the right of the operator to
have a profitable enterprise and to return invested capital to stockholders
with a gain.
   (c)   In summation, the philosophy might be stated as one based on mutual
good faith, as involving the City, its residents and the operator.
(Ord. 123-76. Passed 6-17-76.)
820.03 INTENT; FINDINGS.
   Underscoring certain pertinent facts having to do with communication
ventures, primarily radio and television type services, which are considered
relevant to the enabling legislation for CATV and which are detailed herein, it
is the stated intention of Council not to impose unreasonable ceilings on rates
to subscribers, which rates in the final analysis, under the free enterprise
system, will be dictated by the subscriber, and not by the operator or some
regulatory body; nor to specify unrealistic fees to be paid by the operator to
the City.
   (a)   The speculative nature of a CATV system required to compete in and to
meet the demands of a "wired city", without the benefits or protection of an
exclusive operator's permit, is hereby noted, together with a need for
substantial risk capital on a long term basis.
   (b)   Restricted broadcast competition for radio and television stations, a
monopolistic condition created by FCC allocation tables or spectrum
limitations, is hereby noted.
   (c)   That broadcast stations pay no fees to anyone for using the public's
air space for the transmission of their signals is hereby noted.
   (d)   That broadcast stations are subject to no rules or regulations of the
Federal government, where the right of regulation is solely vested,
establishing maximum charges for advertising or imposing a pre-determined rate
of return on investment, is also hereby noted.
(Ord. 123-76. Passed 6-17-76.)
820.04 MAXIMUM VALUE SERVICE REQUIRED; ANNUAL REVIEW.
   Conversely, but as another facet of the mutual good faith philosophy
introduced in part in Sections
820.02 and
820.03, it is the stated intention of this chapter to require maximum value
service for subscribers in the City. Therefore, Council retains the option, to
be exercised upon recommendation of the Mayor, for a thorough annual review to
ascertain:
   (a)   The fairness of the operator's rates;
   (b)   Whether the fees paid to the City in previous years by the operator
were adequate and/or justifiable, each as measured against the service or
services being rendered subscribers; and/or
   (c)   Whether the operations authorized hereunder continue to be in the
public interest.
(Ord. 123-76. Passed 6-17-76.)
820.05 CONSIDERATIONS FOR REVIEW.
   In order for the operator to meet the prerequisites of maximum value service
to subscribers, his or her system necessarily must be viable and a worthwhile
investment for ownership; otherwise, operating funds for optimum service and
sufficient additional capital for expansion and extension of service in the
future, as both anticipated and desired by Council, will not be available.
   It is to be emphasized that Council, with such an understanding as expressed
in this section, will never act capriciously or arbitrarily with its right of
review as set forth in Section
820.04, and no review will be undertaken and no action detrimental to the
operator will be proposed as a result of such a review, which have been
motivated by the operator's profit and loss record alone. The overwhelming
issue in any and all reviews will be the propriety of charges for service
versus the service itself, this being of far greater import to Council than
payments to the City.
(Ord. 123-76. Passed 6-17-76.)
820.06 SCOPE OF SERVICE AND OPERATIONS.
   In addition to conventional services currently being offered by operating
community antenna systems, including the signals of TV, AM and FM stations and
also programming originated by the operators, this chapter, anticipating the
future of a "wired city", specifically covers the following:
   (a)   Pay television, programming for which a special or extra fee is
charged, if authorized by the Federal Communications Commission and if such
service is offered by the operator.
   (b)   The sale of advertising in connection with locally originated
programming, if such sales are authorized by the Federal Communications
Commission and if such sales are made by the operator.
   (c)   Any other service or services involving the use of electronic signals,
if authorized by the Federal Communications Commission and if such additional
services are offered by the operator.
(Ord. 123-76. Passed 6-17-76.)
820.07 CHAPTER AS ENABLING ORDINANCE.
   This chapter is an enabling ordinance authorizing the operation of CATV
systems in the City, but it does not take the place of any franchise, license
or permit which may be additionally required of the operator by law, either
currently or at some later date.
(Ord. 123-76. Passed 6-17-76.)
820.08 OPERATOR'S RESPONSIBILITY RE FRANCHISES, LICENSES AND PERMITS.
   It shall be the responsibility of the operator to obtain any and all
franchises, licenses or permits necessary to the operation and conduct of his
or her business activities.
(Ord. 123-76. Passed 6-17-76.)
820.09 VIOLATIONS OF FRANCHISES, LICENSES AND PERMITS; NONPAYMENT OF FEES.
   Failure of the operator to obtain and conform to the provisions of any and
all such franchises, licenses or permits, and to make prescribed payments if
required as a condition of their issuance, shall be considered a violation of
this chapter and subject to the penalties set forth in Sections
820.16 and
820.99.
(Ord. 123-76. Passed 6-17-76.)
820.10 PERFORMANCE DELAYS; TIME EXTENSIONS.
   Provisions of this chapter notwithstanding, delays in the performance of the
operator's obligations under this chapter which are caused by equipment
shortages, a state of war or national emergency, acts of God or any
circumstances beyond the control of the operator, as determined by Council,
shall not be construed to be in violation of the requirements set forth herein,
and reasonable extensions of time shall be granted therefor.
(Ord. 123-76. Passed 6-17-76.)
820.11 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No operator shall offer service to subscribers by means of a community
antenna system within the City, unless he or she holds a permit granted by
ordinance of Council and authorizing such a system within the City and in,
under and over the streets, highways and other public grounds of the City. In
connection with the adoption of such an ordinance, Council shall consider and
approve the operator's character and legal, financial, technical and other
qualifications and that the adequacy and feasibility of its construction
arrangements have been approved by the franchising authority as part of a full
public proceeding affording due process.
(Ord. 123-76. Passed 6-17-76.)
820.12 NONEXCLUSIVENESS OF PERMITS.
   All permits granted by ordinance pursuant to this section shall be
nonexclusive and nonassignable; and Council reserves the right to issue as many
permits as it deems advisable in the public interest.
(Ord. 123-76. Passed 6-17-76.)
820.13 PERMIT EXPIRATION.
   Any permit granted under the terms of this chapter shall be declared null
and void one year from the date it is granted, and such permit shall be revoked
unless the operator who received it satisfactorily demonstrates to the Mayor
compliance with the timetable set forth in Section
820.04.
(Ord. 123-76. Passed 6-17-76.)
820.14 PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS; OBTAINING AGREEMENTS AND APPROVAL; TIMETABLE
FOR MAKING SERVICE AVAILABLE.
   The operator, not later than six months from the effective date of the
ordinance granting him or her a permit, shall furnish to Council, for approval,
complete plans and specifications for the construction and operation of his or
her system, including transmission and distribution, which insofar as is
technically and economically practical shall call for service to all the
incorporated area of the City, as of that date. Within thirty days after
receiving approval from Council, the operator shall begin all the procedures to
obtain whatever agreements, if any, are required from utility companies and
approvals from the City officials required herein. After obtaining all
necessary agreements and approvals, the service contemplated by this chapter
shall be made available to all residences in the City within one year after
commencement of construction and to all business establishments and other
potential users in the City within two years after commencement of

      (1)   A maximum installation charge for the first television set, and a
maximum charge for each additional television set on the same premises.
      (2)   A maximum charge for basic monthly service for the first television
set, and a maximum charge for each additional television set on the premises.
      (3)   The maximum disconnection-reconnection charge related to the
temporary suspension of service requested by a subscriber, which shall be no
more than the monthly service charge.
      (4)   The maximum reconnection charge, if service has been terminated by
the operator for nonpayment of fees.
      (5)   The installation charge, which shall be personal to the individual
subscriber. Upon removal to another location within the City, the maximum
reconnection charge shall be no more than the monthly charge for service.
   (b)   If a use tax is ever imposed on CATV charges, such tax may, at the
option of the operator, be added to the maximums listed in the approved rate
schedule.
   (c)   The rates listed in the approved rate schedule apply to basic service
to individual dwelling units, consisting of up to and including twelve
television channels. It is understood that, consistent with the rules of the
FCC, Council's jurisdiction over rates applies only to rates regarding regular
subscriber services. Regular subscriber services comprise the delivery of
normal broadcast signals and such services as are required on the system by the
FCC. They exclude, without limitation, such auxiliary services as pay cable,
leased channels and data transmission.
   (d)   It is not the intent of this chapter to retard the growth of CATV
service beyond the conventional twelve channels offered by most systems, a
limitation imposed by the industry. If and when expanded regular service beyond
twelve channels is offered by the operator, the operator shall have the right
to apply to Council for a second rate structure. An increase in the rates
listed in the approved rate schedule will be favorably considered by Council,
assuming an additional investment in equipment or an increase in operating
costs.
(Ord. 123-76. Passed 6-17-76.)
820.51 SCHEDULES FOR COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENTS.
   Although no effort is made by this chapter to establish maximum rates for
commercial establishments or for buildings requiring special arrangements for
service, including apartment buildings, hotels and motels already possessing
their own master distribution systems, the operator shall, before offering any
such service, submit his or her proposed rate structure to Council for
approval.
(Ord. 123-76. Passed 6-17-76.)
820.52 SCHEDULES FOR UNCONVENTIONAL SERVICES.
   The operator shall, if and when the services outlined in Section
820.06 as possible services to be offered are actually offered as services,
submit detailed proposals of all applicable rate structures to Council for
approval, if such services are regular subscriber services under Section
820.50.
(Ord. 123-76. Passed 6-17-76.)
820.53 FILING RULES, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES.
   A current, up-to-date copy of all the operator's rules, regulations and
policies concerning subscriber service will be kept on file with the Mayor. No
rule, regulation or policy shall be contrary to the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 123-76. Passed 6-17-76.)
820.54 INTERPRETATION; CONFLICTS.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to supersede any rule or regulation
of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) relative to cable television
systems and franchises. In the event of a conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter and a provision of such FCC rules and regulations,
the latter shall control.
820.55 SEPARABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this
chapter is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court
of competent jurisdiction, or in conflict with rules and regulations of the
Federal Communications Commission, then such provision shall be deemed a
separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect
the validity of the remaining provisions hereof.
(Ord. 123-76. Passed 6-17-76.)
820.99 PENALTY.
   In addition to the provisions of Section
818.16 dealing with revocation of permits, whoever violates any of the

   (a)   “Alarm holder” means any person, organization or company in control of
a building property, or part thereof located in the City, in which an alarm
system is installed and maintained.
   (b)   “Alarm system” means any assembly of equipment and devices which
signals, so as to be seen or heard outside the protected building or space, the
presence of robbery, burglary, vandalism, unauthorized intrusion, fire or
medical emergency.
   (c)   “Automatic dialing device” means a device, which is interconnected to
a telephone line and is programmed to select a predetermined telephone number
and transmit by voice message or code signal an emergency message indicating a
need for emergency response.
   (d)   “False alarm” means any alarm signal or message initiated and
transmitted either automatically or manually through an alarm system to the
City soliciting an emergency response by Police or Fire Department personnel,
when robbery, burglary, vandalism, unauthorized intrusion, fire or medical
emergency does not, in fact, exist, but does not include an alarm signal caused
by hurricanes, tornados, or other catastrophic acts of God not reasonably
subject to control by alarm manufacturer, installer, or alarm holder. An alarm
shall be deemed a “false alarm” when; upon visual inspection by the responding
public safety personnel, there is no evidence of the condition for which the
alarm was made. Such evidence may be the lack of physical damage, no electrical
power interruption, or atmosphere conditions, which may have disturbed windows
or doors.
   (e)   “Inter-connected alarm system” means any alarm system which directly
or indirectly automatically or manually, uses a telephone line to transmit an
alarm or message upon activation of the alarm system.
   (f)   “Local alarm” means any alarm system that when activated only sounds a
horn, bell, buzzer, or other type of audible or visible alarm that is designed
to be audible or visible beyond the premises being served but which does not
result in the transmission of a signal to any other location.

872.02 AUTOMATIC DIALING DEVICES.
   (a)   No person shall use or cause to be used any telephone device or
telephone attachment that automatically selects any telephone line allocated by

provisions of Section
872.99.
   (b)   In the event that public safety numbers are changed or an alarm line
is designated, all automatic dialing devices shall be reprogrammed to use the
designated telephone line within ten days of notification of the designation by
the City Administrator.
(Ord. 103-03. Passed 2-6-03.)
872.03 EXEMPTIONS.
   The provisions of this chapter are not applicable to local alarm systems or

872.04 FALSE ALARM SERVICE CHARGES.
   (a)   False alarms are declared to be a public nuisance and a danger that
are avoidable, and by reason of the activity and responses intended to be
generated, present a threat to the safety, health and welfare of the citizens
of the City. The alarm holder shall reimburse the City for all costs incurred
by reason of a false alarm, which shall at minimum be as follows:
 
Residential Alarm Holder
Number of False Alarms Per Year Amount of Penalty per Occurrence
1-3                             $0.00

13-more                         $200.00
 
   (b)   This section imposes strict liability for all false alarms. Upon
determination that the alarm is false, as defined by this chapter, then the
issue of fact is conclusive and fault, except as may be exempted by this
chapter, is not a defense to the assessments stated by this section.
   (c)   On the fourth occurrence in a year, the City may waive the cost of
what otherwise would be associated with a false alarm, if the alarm holder
supplies the City with a plan of action to resolve the problem of false alarms.
(Ord. 103-03. Passed 2-6-03.)
872.05 DUTY OF ALARM HOLDER OR ALARM SYSTEM OWNER.
   (a)   It shall be the sole responsibility of the alarm holder or alarm
system owner to select proper equipment and qualified installers to assure
proper installation of any alarm system, and properly service and maintain the
alarm system at all times. No claim of defective installation or age of the
alarm system shall be a defense for a "false alarm" service charge assessed. It
is the intent of this section to impose strict liability for any "false alarm"
upon the alarm holder to this section and any or all sections of this chapter.
   (b)   No alarm holder or alarm system owner or alarm system lessee shall
fail to promptly respond to a request by public safety personnel to disconnect
or reset an alarm. Any person responsible for the alarm who fails to respond
within a reasonable time period, upon receiving notice by public safety
personnel, is guilty of a minor misdemeanor for the first offense. Whoever
violates this section more than once in a calender year, defined as January 1st
to December 31st, is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
   (c)   No liability will be imposed upon public safety personnel or the City
as a result of rendering the system inoperable, nor shall there be any
liability for loss or damage to the premises, contents, or business
interruption that may occur as a direct result or proximate cause of such
action.
   (d)   Where the OBC or Fire Code requires an alarm system, the alarm holder,
owner or lessee who disables an alarm because of faulty equipment shall provide
a fire watch during the period the alarm is disabled.
(Ord. 103-03. Passed 2-6-03.)
872.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   No alarm holder shall allow more than three chargeable false alarms,
as defined by Section
872.01(d) to be transmitted to public safety personnel during the immediately
preceding one year calendar period. An alarm will be classified as false if the
responding public safety personnel see not evidence of fire, robbery, burglary,
vandalism, unauthorized intrusion or medical emergency.
   (b)   If the alarm holder proves that the alarm was caused by an event not
reasonably foreseeable and which could not have been prevented by the proper
adjustment or pre-setting of the sensor threshold, the alarm will be designated
a nonchargeable false alarm. Such evidence shall be presented to the Director
of Public Safety or designee, within fourteen days of the false alarm. Failure
to provide the evidence in a timely manner shall exclude any consideration of
the evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates subsection (a) hereof, or any subparagraph thereof,
is guilty of a minor misdemeanor in addition to any other fine or service
charge provided by this chapter.

880.03 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)   An annual tax for the purposes specified in Section
880.01 shall be imposed on and after November 1, 1968 at the rate of one
percent (1%) per annum, subject to Section
880.031 and Section
880.032, upon the following:
      (1)   On all income, qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation
earned and/or received on and after November 1, 1968, by residents of the City,
including compensation made to employees by or for an employer for vacation
pay, a wage continuation plan during periods of disability and/or sickness. For
further clarification “income” includes, but is not limited to:
         A.   Spousal support received (i.e., alimony).
         B.   Lottery, gambling and sports winnings, games of chance, and
prizes and/or awards.
            1.   If the taxpayer is not considered a professional gambler for
federal income tax purposes, the tax shall apply to all income of six hundred
dollars ($600.00) or more per event won by the taxpayer. An “event” shall mean
a singular game or contest on which a wager is placed or entered.
            2.   If the taxpayer is considered a professional gambler for
federal income tax purposes, related deductions as permitted by the Internal
Revenue Code shall be allowed against gambling and sports winnings.
      (2)   On all income, qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation
earned and/or received on and after November 1, 1968, by nonresidents for work
done or services performed or rendered in the City, including compensation made
to employees by or for an employer for vacation pay, a wage continuation plan
during periods of disability and/or sickness. Separation pay, termination pay,
reduction-in-force pay, and other compensation paid as a result of an employee
leaving the service of an employer shall be allocable only to the City.
         A.   London shall not, however, tax the compensation of a nonresident
individual who will be deemed to be an occasional entrant if all of the
following apply:
            1.   The compensation is paid for personal services performed by
the individual in the City on twelve or fewer days during the calendar year, in
which case the individual shall be considered an occasional entrant for
purposes of the City income tax. A day is a full day or any fractional part of
a day.
            2.   In the case of an individual who is an employee, the principal
place of business of the individual's employer is located outside the City and
the individual pays tax on compensation described in Section
890.03(b) to the municipality, if any, in which the employer's principal place
of business is located, and no portion of that tax is refunded to the
individual.
            3.   The individual is not a professional entertainer or
professional athlete, the promoter of a professional entertainment or sports
event, or an employee of such a promoter, all as may be reasonably defined by
the City.
         B.   Beginning with the thirteenth day an individual deemed to have
been an occasional entrant to the City performs services within the City, the
employer of said individual shall begin withholding the City income tax from
remuneration paid by the employer to the individual, and shall remit the
withheld income tax to the City in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter. Since the individual can no longer be considered to have been an
occasional entrant, the employer is further required to remit taxes on income
earned in the City by the individual for the first twelve days.
         C.   If the individual is self-employed, it shall be the
responsibility of the individual to remit the appropriate income tax to the
City.
      (3)   A.   On the portion attributable to the City of the net profits
earned on and after November 1, 1968, of all resident unincorporated
businesses, professions, associations, or other entities, derived from sales
made, work done, services performed or rendered and business or other
activities conducted in the City.
         B.   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits
earned and/or received on and after November 1, 1968, of a resident partner or
owner of a resident unincorporated business entity not attributable to the City
and not levied against such unincorporated business entity.
      (4)   A.   On the portion attributable to the City of the net profits
earned on and after November 1, 1968, of all nonresident unincorporated
businesses, professions, associations, or other entities, derived from sales
made, work done or services performed or rendered and business or other
activities conducted in the City, whether or not such unincorporated business
entity has an office or place of business in the City.
         B.   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits
earned and/or received on and after November 1, 1968, of a resident partner or
owner of a nonresident unincorporated business entity not attributable to the
City and not levied against such unincorporated business entity.
      (5)   On the portion attributable to the City, of the net profits earned
on and after November 1, 1968, of all corporations derived from sales made,
work done, services performed or rendered and business or other activities
conducted in the City, whether or not such corporations have an office or place
of business in the City.
      (6)   Effective for tax years 2004 and later, the distributive share of
income paid to an S corporation shareholder shall be taxable only to the extent
of the portion, if any, that represents wages, or net earnings from self-
employment.
   (b)   The portion of the net profits attributable to the City of a taxpayer
conducting a business, profession or other activity both within and without the
boundaries of the City shall be determined as provided in Ohio R.C. 718.02 and
in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by the Director of
Taxation pursuant to this chapter.
   (c)   (1)   Commencing with taxable years beginning subsequent to December
31, 1992, the portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
allocable to the City may not be offset against salaries, wages, commissions
and other compensation but may be applied against the portion of the profit of
succeeding years allocable to the City until exhausted, but in no event for
more than five taxable years. Commencing with taxable years beginning January
1, 2008, the portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
allocable to the City may not be offset against salaries, wages, commissions
and other compensation but may be applied against the portion of the profit for
years 2008, 2009 and 2010 allocable to the City until exhausted. Effective
January 1, 2010, no net operating loss may be applied toward any profit. No
portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back against net profits of
any prior year.
      (2)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the City in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to
the City.
      (3)   The Director shall provide by rules and regulations the manner in
which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.
   (d)   (1)   Consolidated Returns. Any affiliated group which files a
consolidated return for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of
the Internal Revenue Code may file a consolidated return with the City.
      (2)   In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the City
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Director shall require
such additional information as he or she deems necessary to ascertain whether
net profits are properly allocated to the City. If the Director finds net
profits are not properly allocated to the City by reason of transactions with
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or transactions with such division, branch, factory,
office, laboratory or activity, or by some other method, he or she shall make
such allocation as he or she deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper
allocation of net profits to the City.
   (e)   (1)   Rentals received by the taxpayer are to be included only if and
to the extent that the rental, ownership, management or operation of the real
estate from which such rentals are derived, whether so rented, managed or
operated by the taxpayer individually or through agents or other
representatives, constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole or in
part.
      (2)   Where the gross monthly rental of any real properties, regardless
of number and value, aggregate in excess of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per
month, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the rental, ownership, management
or operation of such properties is a business activity of such taxpayer, and
the net income of such rental properties shall be subject to tax; provided,
that in case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered engaged in a
business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or fluctuating percentage
of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the lessee, whether or not such
rental exceeds one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month; provided, further, that
in the case of farm property, the owner shall be considered engaged in a
business activity when he or she shares in the crops or when the rental is
based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts derived from the farm,
whether or not the gross income exceeds one hundred dollars ($100.00) per
month; and provided, further, that the person who operates a rooming house of
five or more rooms rented shall be considered in business whether or not the
gross income exceeds one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month.
      (3)   In determining the amount of gross monthly rental of any real
property, periods during which, by reason of vacancy or any other cause,
rentals are not received shall not be taken into consideration by the taxpayer.
      (4)   Rentals received by a taxpayer engaged in the business of buying
and selling real estate shall be considered as part of business income.
      (5)   Real property, as used in this section, includes commercial
property, residential property, farm property and any and all other types of
real estate.
      (6)   In determining the taxable income from rentals, the deductible
expenses shall be of the same nature, extent and amount as are allowed by the
Internal Revenue Service for Federal income tax purposes.
      (7)   Residents of the City are subject to taxation upon the net income
from rentals, to the extent above specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (6)
hereof, regardless of the location of the real property owned.
      (8)   Nonresidents of the City are subject to such taxation only if the
real property is situated within the City. Nonresidents, in determining whether
gross monthly rentals exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00), shall take into
consideration only real estate situated within the City.
      (9)   Corporations owning or managing real estate are taxable only on
that portion of income derived from property located in the City.
      (10)   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties,
regardless of number and value, aggregates in one hundred dollars ($100.00) per
month or less and therefore may not be considered a business activity, the
income shall be taxed as ordinary income.
   (f)   Exemptions. The tax provided for herein shall not be levied upon:
      (1)   The military pay or allowances of members of the armed forces of
the United States and of members of their reserve components, including the

nature of compensation for service rendered from whatever source derived.
      (5)   The income of religious, fraternal, charitable, scientific,
literary or educational institutions to the extent that such income is derived
from tax exempt real estate, tax exempt tangible or intangible property or has
tax exempt activities. This exemption does not include unrelated income that is

      (6)   Receipts by bona fide charitable, religious and educational
organizations and associations, when those receipts are from seasonal or casual

exempt from Federal income tax.

      (1)   In the case of individuals the extended due date shall be the last
day of the month following the month to which the due date of the federal
income tax return has been extended.
      (2)   In the case of businesses, the extended due date shall be the last
day of the month to which the due date of the federal income tax return has
been extended, if the annual return is filed through the Ohio Business Gateway.
If not filed through the Ohio Business gateway the extended due date remains
the last day of the month following the month to which the due date of the
federal income tax return has been extended.
      (3)   The Director may deny the extension if the taxpayer fails to file
the request timely, fails to file a copy of the federal extension request, or
if the taxpayer's income tax account with the City is delinquent in any way.
      (4)   The Director may require a tentative return, accompanied by payment
of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon by the date the return is normally
due. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is filed
and the final tax paid within the period as extended, but interest shall be
assessed from the original due date of the return.
   (d)   (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of filing
thereof, pay to the Director the balance of tax due, if any, after deducting
the amount of City income tax deducted or withheld at source, pursuant to this
chapter, together with such portion of the tax as has been paid on declaration
by the taxpayer and any credit allowable under the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   Should the return or the records of the Director indicate an
overpayment of the tax to which the City is entitled under the provisions of
this chapter, such overpayment shall first be applied against any existing
liability, and the balance, if any, at the election of the taxpayer
communicated to the Director, shall be refunded or transferred against any
subsequent liability. However, overpayments or liabilities shall not be paid or
collected if less than ten dollars ($10.00).
   (e)   (1)   Where necessary an amended return must be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of

used for the federal return) or apportionment of net profits after the due date
for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability, such taxpayer shall make
and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City tax based
upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and pay any additional
tax shown due thereon or make claim for a refund of any overpayment.

or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and making the payment
shall be personally liable for failure to file the return or pay the tax,
penalties, or interest due as required herein. The dissolution, bankruptcy or

employee's liability for a prior failure of such business to file the return or
pay taxes, penalties, or interest due.
   (j)   The failure of any taxpayer to receive or procure a return,
declaration or other required form shall not excuse the taxpayer from filing
such forms or from paying the tax due.
(Ord. 184-08. Passed 11-20-08; Ord. 114-15. Passed 3-19-15.)
880.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer within or doing business within the City and who employs
one or more persons on an income, qualifying wage, commission or other
compensation basis shall deduct, at the time of the payment of income,
qualifying wage, commission or other compensation, the tax of one percent (1%)
of the income, qualifying wages, commissions or other compensation due by such
employer to the employee and shall, on or before the last day of the month
following the close of each calendar quarter, make a return and pay to the
Director the amount of taxes so deducted. The returns shall be on a form or
forms prescribed by or acceptable to the Director and shall be subject to the
rules and regulations prescribed therefore by the Director. Each employer shall
be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld,
whether or not such taxes have in fact been withheld.
   (b)   Such employer in collecting such tax shall be deemed to hold the same,
until payment is made by such employer to the City, as a trustee for the
benefit of the City, and any such tax collected by such employer from his or
her employees shall, until the same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund
in the hands of such employer.
   (c)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on the wages or other
compensation paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about such
person's residence, but such servants shall be subject to the provisions of
this chapter.
   (d)   On or before February 28th of each year, each employer shall file a
withholding return setting forth the name, address, and social security number

employers, brokers or others who engage persons, either on a fee or commission
basis or as independent contractors and not employees (i.e., those who are not
subject to withholding) must provide the City Income Tax Department with copies
of all 1099 Miscellaneous Income Forms and/or a list of names, addresses,
Social Security numbers and a total amount of earnings, payments, bonuses,
commissions and/or fees paid to each person for any services provided in the
city.
   (f)   All employers that provide any contractual service within the City,

responsible for all income tax employer requirements under this chapter.
   (g)   The officer or the employee having control or supervision of or
charged with the responsibility of withholding the tax, and/or of filing the
report and making payment, is personally liable for failure to file the report
or pay the tax due as required by this section. The dissolution of a
corporation or limited partnership does not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of the corporation or limited
partnership to file returns or pay the tax due.

enterprise or activity subject to the tax imposed by this chapter, shall file a
declaration setting forth such estimated income and/or the estimated profit or
loss from such business activity, together with the estimated tax due thereon,

is less than one hundred dollars ($100), such person need not file a
declaration.
   (b)   Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 15 of each year
during the life of this chapter and, beginning with tax year 2008, on or before
the federal filing date if it is other than April 15th. Those taxpayers
reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration within three and one-
half months after the beginning of each fiscal year or period and, beginning
with tax year 2008, on or before the federal filing date if it is other than
the fifteenth day of the fourth month from the end of such fiscal year or
period.
   (c)   Such declaration shall be filed upon a form or forms furnished by or
obtainable upon request from the Director, or on an acceptable generic form as
defined in this Chapter, which form or forms may require a statement that the
figures used in making such declaration are the figures used in making the
declaration of the estimate for the Federal income tax adjusted to set forth
only such income as is taxable under the provisions of this chapter. Credit
shall be taken for City income tax to be withheld, if any, from any portion of
such income.
   (d)   The original declaration, or any subsequent amendment thereof, may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment date as
provided for herein.
   (e)   Such declaration of estimated tax to be paid the City shall be

thereon shall be paid in equal installments on or before the remaining payment
dates.
   (f)   If the taxpayer is an individual, at least a similar amount shall be
paid on or before the last day of the seventh, tenth, and thirteenth months
after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year, provided that in case an
amended declaration has been filed, or the taxpayer is taxable for a portion of
the year only, the unpaid balance shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
   (g)   If the taxpayer is a corporation or association, at least a similar
amount shall be paid on or before the fifteenth day of the sixth, ninth, and
twelfth months of the taxable year; provided, however, that in case an amended
declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon shall be paid
in equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
   (h)   No penalties or interest shall be assessed, for not filing a
declaration, on any resident taxpayer who was not domiciled in the City on the
first day of January in the year in which they became subject to estimated
payments, nor shall penalties or interest be assessed on estimated payments if
the taxpayer has remitted an amount equal to one hundred percent of the
previous year's tax liability, provided that the previous year reflected a
twelve-month period and the taxpayer filed a return for that year, nor shall
penalties or interest be assessed on estimated payments if the taxpayer has
remitted an amount equal to ninety percent of the final tax liability for the

(Ord. 184-08. Passed 11-20-08.)
880.09 DUTIES OF THE DIRECTOR OF TAXATION.
   (a)   (1)   It shall be the duty of the Director of Taxation to collect and
receive the tax imposed by this chapter, in the manner prescribed by this
chapter, from the taxpayers. It shall also be his or her duty to keep an
accurate record for a minimum of six (6) years showing the amount received by
him or her from each taxpayer required to file a declaration and/or make a
return and the date of such receipt. Records need not be kept longer than six
(6) years unless an account is not paid in full, or unless an investigation is
pending on an account.
      (2)   The Director shall make a written report to the City
Administration, City Auditor, and City Council each quarter of all moneys
collected hereunder during the preceding quarter, shall report on the status of
delinquencies, and shall provide other requested information, if any, that is
not confidential.
   (b)   The Director is hereby charged with the enforcement of the provisions
of this chapter, and is hereby empowered, subject to the approval of the Board
of Review, to adopt and promulgate and to enforce rules and regulations
relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the administration and
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, including provisions for the re-
examination and correction of returns and payments. Taxpayers are required to
comply with the requirements of this ordinance and any rules and regulations.
   (c)   The Director is authorized to arrange for the payment of unpaid taxes,
interest and penalties on a schedule of installment payments, when the taxpayer
has proved to the Director that, due to certain hardship conditions, he or she
is unable to pay the full amount of the tax due. Such authorization shall not
be granted until proper returns are filed by the taxpayer for all amounts owed
by him or her under this chapter. Failure to make any deferred payment when due
shall cause the total unpaid amount, including penalty and interest, to become
payable on demand.
   (d)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed
a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Director shall
fix the amount of tax actually due the City from the taxpayer and shall send to
such taxpayer by certified mail a written statement (i.e., assessment) showing
the amount of tax so fixed, together with interest and penalties thereon, if
any. Such determination of the Director may be modified or amended based upon
information or data subsequently secured by or made available to the Director.
If the taxpayer fails to respond to the assessment notice within 30 days, the
tax, penalties, and interest assessed shall become due and payable and
collectible as are other unpaid taxes, penalty, and interest.
   (e)   The Director shall have the power to compromise any interest or
penalty, or both. In those cases where interest and/or penalty have been abated
in whole or in part, a report of those actions shall be presented by the
Director to the Board of review at the subsequent meeting of the parties.
   (f)   The Director of Taxation shall deposit, with the properly designated
depository, payments received within one business day of receipt of said
payments if the total of the payments exceeds one thousand dollars ($1,000); if
the total does not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) the payments shall be
deposited within three business days of receipt of said payments. All unopened
correspondence containing said payments shall be kept in a locked compartment
until opened.
(Ord. 184-08. Passed 11-20-08.)

tax returns of any employer or of any taxpayer or person subject to the tax for
the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
made, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Every such employer,
supposed employer, taxpayer or supposed taxpayer is hereby directed and
required to furnish, within ten (10) calendar days following a written request
by the Director or his or her duly authorized agent or employee, the means,
facilities and opportunity for making such examinations and investigations as
are hereby authorized.
   (b)   The Director or any authorized employee is hereby authorized to order
or subpoena any person to appear at the office of the Director and to examine
any person, under oath, concerning any income which was or should have been
returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect such income, and for
this purpose may compel the production of books, papers, records and Federal
and State income tax returns and the attendance of all persons before him or
her, whether as parties or witnesses, whenever he or she believes such persons
have knowledge of such income or information pertinent to such inquiry.
   (c)   The refusal to produce books, papers, records and Federal and State
tax returns, or the refusal of such examination by any employer or person
subject or presumed to be subject to the tax or by any officer, agent or
employee of a person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax, or the
failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this section or with an
order or subpoena of the Director authorized hereby, shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter, punishable as provided in Section
880.99.
   (d)   Information gained as the result of any returns, investigations,
hearings or verifications required or authorized by this chapter shall not be
deemed to be a public record, as defined in Ohio R.C. 149.43. Such information
shall be confidential except for official tax purposes or except in accordance
with proper judicial order. Any person divulging such information in violation
of this chapter shall be subject to the penalty provided in Section
880.99. Each disclosure shall constitute a separate offense. In addition to the
penalties, any employee of the City who violates this section relative to
disclosure of confidential information shall be immediately dismissed from the
service of the City, or if such employee is in the classified civil service,
proper removal charges shall immediately be brought against such employee and
other steps shall be taken in conformity to the rules and regulations of the
civil service laws applicable thereto.
(Ord. 184-08. Passed 11-20-08.)
880.11 INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   All taxes imposed, including estimated taxes, and all moneys withheld
or required to be withheld by employers under the provisions of this chapter
and remaining unpaid after they become due shall bear interest at the rate of
one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or fraction of a month thereof.
   (b)   In addition to interest as provided in subsection (a) hereof,
penalties based on the unpaid tax are hereby imposed as follows:
      (1)   For failure to pay tax due, other than tax withheld, one and one-
half percent (1.5%) per month or fraction of a month thereof.
      (2)   For failure to remit taxes withheld from employee, one and one-half
percent (1.5%) per month or fraction of a month thereof.
      (3)   In addition to the above:
         A.   A taxpayer who fails to file a return shall be subject to a
failure-to-file penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00).
         B.   a taxpayer who files a late return shall be subject to a ten
percent (10%) penalty of the tax amount due the City.

   (d)   A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional tax assessment made
by the Director of Taxation when a return has been filed in good faith and the
tax paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Director. Further, in the
absence of fraud, neither penalty nor interest shall be assessed on any
additional tax assessment resulting from a Federal audit, provided that an
amended return is filed and the additional tax is paid within three months
after final determination of the Federal tax liability.
   (e)   Upon recommendation of the Director, the Board of Review may abate
penalty or interest, or both, or, upon an appeal from the refusal of the
Director to recommend abatement of penalty and interest, the Board may
nevertheless abate penalty or interest, or both.
(Ord. 184-08. Passed 11-20-08.)
880.12 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES; REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)   All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible, together with
any interest and penalties thereon, by suit, as other debts of like amount are
recoverable. Except in the case of fraud, omission of a substantial portion of
income subject to this tax or failure to file a return, an additional
assessment shall not be made after three years after the tax was due or the
return was filed, whichever is later. However, In the case of fraud, omission
of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income subject to this tax, or failure
to file a return, all additional assessments shall be made and all prosecutions
to recover Municipal income taxes and penalties and interest thereon shall be
brought within six years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later. In those cases in which the Federal Commissioner of
Internal Revenue and the taxpayer have executed waiver of the Federal statute
of limitation, the period within which an additional assessment may be made by
the Director of Taxation shall be one year from the time of the final
determination of the Federal tax liability.
   (b)   Claims for refund of City income taxes shall be brought within three
years after the tax was due or the return was filed, whichever is later. In
addition, the following shall apply regarding refunds of tax withheld from non-
qualified deferred compensation plans (NDCP):
      (1)   A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from a NDCP. The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to the NDCP. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP.
      (2)   A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from a NDCP,
and that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP and upon
which municipal tax was withheld, then a refund will be issued on the amount
representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed and the
income received from the NDCP. If different tax rates applied to the tax years
in which deferrals, a weighted average of the different tax rates will be used
to compute the refund amount.
      (3)   Refunds shall be allowed only if the loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee's
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer's terms and conditions
necessary to receive the non-qualified compensation.
   (c)   Income tax that has been deposited with the City of London, but should
have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City of
London as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
Income tax that should have been deposited with the City of London, but was
deposited with another municipality, shall be subject to recovery by the City
of London. The City of London will allow a non-refundable credit for any amount
owed the City of London that is in excess of the amount to be refunded by the
other municipality, as long as the tax rate of the other municipality is the
same or higher than the City of London's tax rate. If the City of London's tax
rate is higher, the tax representing the net difference of the rates is also
subject to collection by the City of London.
   (d)   Payments on delinquent amounts shall be applied in the following
manner:
      (1)   To the taxes owed for any previous year in the order in which such
taxes became due.
      (2)   To unpaid penalty and interest assessments in the order in which
such assessments became due.
      (3)   To the taxpayer's current estimated tax liability.

payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to

for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or Municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure

dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is

the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.

worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in
this State at which the employer provides services that can reasonably be
expected by the employer to last more than twenty days in a calendar year.
Services can reasonably be expected by the employer to last more than twenty
days if either of the following applies at the time the services commence:
            1.   The nature of the services are such that it will require more
than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            2.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to perform
services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services at the
location for more than twenty days.
         C.   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
881.051.
         D.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional entertainer,
or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the performance of
services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (b)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         A.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         B.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         C.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has

         E.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (c)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (b)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (d)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (b)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (d)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages, to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (d)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (e)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold Municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
881.03. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
   (f)   Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
881.051.
   (g)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold Municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this State that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (d) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

881.053   COLLECTION AT SOURCE; CASINO AND VLT.
   (a)   The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino operator,
as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and Ohio R.C.
3772.01, respectively, or a lottery sales agent conducting video lottery
terminals sales on behalf of the State to withhold and remit Municipal income
tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages as provided in this
section.
   (b)   If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the Internal Revenue Service of the amount is required by section

for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator shall

providing the name, address, and Social Security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of
the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino
gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the
preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar

that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
      (3)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino

deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         A.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         B.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
               If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor
is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the Municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (d)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold Municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery

amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information, required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the
video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator
all amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (e) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with Ohio R.C. 5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or Social Security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of Municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty

deducted and withheld.
   (f)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent

following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
            If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (g)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the Municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (h)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:

deducted and withheld.
   (j)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

   (a)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of Municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
881.052;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
881.19(a).
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
881.19(a).
      (4)   Nothing in division (b) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         C.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)B. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's Municipal income tax
liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the

following criteria:
         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         B.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from a
location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (e)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
         A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (f)   (1)   Except as provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a Municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
881.081.
   (g)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Section
881.03(c)(11)L. and (c)(34)A.4., by a municipal corporation to which the
taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add
the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was
apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
         This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment
to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.

Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated Federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. ''Consolidated
Federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (a)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 4927.01.

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         A.   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the
first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under Federal law.

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated Municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last

effect under division (b)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
Municipal income tax.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests, and receives written permission
from the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (d)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Municipal income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury

Federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (e)(3), and
(e)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated Municipal income

"federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that
division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C
corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
881.03(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:

consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
881.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the

entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in

all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated Municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
881.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
881.062 by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (h)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of

not exceeding fifteen years. Before the Municipality passes an ordinance
allowing such a credit, the Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an
agreement specifying all the conditions of the credit.

   (b)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division, "date of
the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         C.   A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall
make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         D.   Taxes withheld by a casino operator or by a lottery sales agent
under Ohio R.C. 718.031 are deemed to be paid to the municipal corporation for
which the taxes were withheld on the date the taxes are withheld from the

      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of Municipal income tax returns under Section
881.091(g) or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the first
taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         D.   On or before the fifteenth day of the first month of the
following taxable year, ninety percent of the tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in divisions (c)(1)A.
through D. of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return, in accordance with Section
881.091.
         A.   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals and
are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is due
on the same date as the filing of the Federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of Ohio R.C. 5747.08.
         B.   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
881.10 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the

percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven

date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100
percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with the
municipal corporation under Section
881.091 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.

881.08   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID
881.081   REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for Federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         B.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)A. of this
section computed without regard to division (a)(2)B. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid Municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any Municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
(Ord. 162-15. Passed 10-1-15.)
881.082   CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to Section 881.081.
(Ord. 162-15. Passed 10-1-15.)
881.083   CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
881.096.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
881.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (c)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
881.096.
   (d)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section 881.081 regarding
any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 162-15. Passed 10-1-15.)

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under Section
881.051(c) when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income subject to
the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of an employer,

individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized

   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed

information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (e)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (f)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's Social Security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's Federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or

municipal corporation, Ohio IT 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return
or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund
request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer
who files the annual return required by this section electronically is not
required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund

      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
Municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be

of undocumented credits or losses.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of State individual income tax returns under division

Administrator.
         C.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
881.092 applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts
with any provision in Section
881.092, the provision in Section
881.092 prevails.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality, shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a

Municipality an annual net profit return under division (f)(3) and (f)(4) of
this section.
   (i)   (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment. For
purposes of this section, “receiving that payment” refers to the transfer of
funds from the account of the taxpayer. Such funds are no longer under the
control of the taxpayer once the timestamp has occurred.
   (j)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section 881.051 shall be allowed to
the recipient of the compensation as credits against payment of the tax imposed
on the recipient unless the amounts withheld were not remitted to the
Municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
Municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (m)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (n)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
881.052.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         A.   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         B.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
               The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also

services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the

information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in Municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of Municipal
taxable income on an annual Municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (n) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an

Resolution 109-16 as Exhibit A to the satisfaction of the Income Tax Department
are hereby exempt from the requirements to file a return pursuant to this

otherwise due to the Municipality before the 181st day after the applicant's
active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (b)

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (d)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

881.094   EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (a)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return shall automatically receive

date of the Municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (b)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic Federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a Municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the Municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended Federal income tax return.
   (c)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's Municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the Municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (d)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (e)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing State income tax returns under division (G) of Ohio R.C. 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a Municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the Municipal income tax return
shall be the same as the extended due date of the State income tax return.

State tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Municipal return showing income subject
to the Municipal income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or
State tax liability, and pay any additional Municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated Municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
881.19 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by Section
881.19(a)(2) for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10.00) or less,
no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth
in division (c)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
881.096. Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this section, the request
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

881.096   REFUNDS.

agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars ($10.00).
   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (b)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
881.18.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (b) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any Municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
Section
881.10(a)(4).

entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by

any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was

employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal

served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (d)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal and State income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 162-15. Passed 10-1-15.)
881.134   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's Social Security number, Federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (b)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
881.10, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
881.99.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (a) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
881.10.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
881.99 for a violation of Section
881.15 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.
(Ord. 162-15. Passed 10-1-15.)
881.14   CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by Ohio R.C. Chapter 718 or
by the charter or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person
shall access or disclose such information except in accordance with a proper
judicial order or in connection with the performance of that person's official
duties or the official business of the Municipality as authorized by Ohio R.C.
Chapter 718 or the charter or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax
Administrator of the Municipality or a designee thereof may furnish copies of
returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and other related tax
information to the Internal Revenue Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and
Tax Administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 162-15. Passed 10-1-15.)
881.15   FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
State law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 162-15. Passed 10-1-15.)
881.16   OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective Municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (b)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (c), (g), and (h) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (c)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified State law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
State law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of Federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
Federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to Federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (d)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
881.15.
   (e)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (c) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (g)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (j)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (f) of this section may not be
appealed.
(Ord. 162-15. Passed 10-1-15.)
881.17   ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Ohio R.C. 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord 162-15. Passed 10-1-15.)
881.18    LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be domiciled in the
Municipality. Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the top administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an
employee of the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The Board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Ohio R.C.
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day of the
hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the Board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board's
final determination as provided in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Ohio R.C. 149.43. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to Ohio R.C. 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.
(Ord. 162-15. Passed 10-1-15.)
881.19   ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover Municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on Municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
881.18. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Local Board of Tax Review
with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have jurisdiction to
affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of Municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
881.096.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
881.18, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of
the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the amount due from
the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than the amount paid,
there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's assigns or legal
representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as provided by Section
881.096, with interest on that amount as provided by division (d) of this
section.
   (e)   No civil action to recover Municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 162-15. Passed 10-1-15.)
881.20   ADOPTION OF RULES.

chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator to adopt rules to administer
the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (b)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.
(Ord. 162-15. Passed 10-1-15.)

Taxation within thirty days of residence in the City.
   (b)   On October 1, 2016, and every year thereafter, all landlords who rent
property within the City shall submit a current list of their tenants, with
addresses, to the Director. A penalty of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) per year
will be assessed for late submission of the tenant list. The Director will
notify the landlords in writing of the filing requirement at least thirty days
prior to the due date for the annual tenant list.
(Ord. 162-15. Passed 10-1-15.)
881.97   COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (a)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall
continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the
aforesaid period are fully paid and any and all suits and prosecutions for the
collection of taxes or for the punishment of violations of this chapter have
been fully terminated, subject to the limitations contained in Section
881.19.

(Ord. 162-15. Passed 10-1-15.)
881.98   SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax imposed
against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included in this chapter.
(Ord. 162-15. Passed 10-1-15.)

882.01 COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT AREAS; TAX EXEMPTIONS. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section 882.01 was repealed by Ordinance 176-98, passed June
25, 1998.)
882.02 ENTERPRISE ZONE POLICY. 
   (a)   Introduction. In an effort to spur revitalization of the City's
traditional industrial belt, the City of London has designated an Enterprise
Zone pursuant to State law. An Enterprise Zone is an area within which special
tax incentives may be offered by contract to businesses which agree to invest
in capital improvements and/or create and/or retain jobs. Tax incentives will
be offered, provided that program guidelines are met and a substantial
investment is made. Jobs must be either created or retained. Each contract with
a business within the Enterprise Zone relating to jobs, investment and tax
incentives must be submitted to London City Council and the Madison County
Commissioners for their approval.
   (b)   Purpose. The purpose of the Enterprise Zone is to encourage as much
investment and job creation as possible within the boundaries of the Enterprise
Zone. Retaining jobs is also a priority. Each contract negotiated with a local
business shall be designed to spur capital investment while creating or
retaining jobs. In return, the City will agree to provide the minimum amount of
tax incentives possible under the circumstances of each transaction.
   (c)   Eligible Businesses.
      (1)   Only those businesses that are "qualified by financial
responsibility and business experience to create and preserve employee
opportunities in the Enterprise Zone and to improve the economic climate of the
municipal corporation..." (Ohio R.C. 5709.632) may apply for the tax incentives
available.
      (2)   Furthermore, only businesses engaged in manufacturing, warehousing,
research and development, and distribution, will be eligible to apply for the
tax incentives. These uses are customarily permitted in M-1 Heavy
Manufacturing, M-2 Light Manufacturing and PUD Planned Unit Development
Districts, as set forth in the Zoning Code.
      (3)   No housing, commercial (retail) or institutional uses may benefit
from the Enterprise Zone Program. Businesses engaged in B-1, B-2, B-3, R-1, R-
2, R-3 and R-4 land uses are not eligible.
   (d)   Minimum Assistance. In order to minimize the loss of new tax revenues,
only the minimum abatement possible to bring about the investment will be
offered. State law permits up to seventy-five percent abatement of new real and
personal property taxes for a period of up to ten years. The maximum allowable
abatement in amount and in duration will only be offered when absolutely
necessary to bring about the investment.
   (e)   No Retroactivity. The tax incentives available will only be offered
when absolutely necessary to bring about the investment. No incentives will be
made available after an investment in land, building and/or equipment has
already occurred. In order to qualify to receive the tax incentives, the
investment must take place subsequent to approval by the City of London. Any
business interested in receiving the tax incentives must show that the
incentives requested are essential to cause the investment and, if not for the
available tax incentives, the investment would not have been made.
   (f)   Degree of Investment Required. Only businesses that agree to make a
substantial investment in either real property and/or personal property shall
be eligible to receive the benefits available under the Program. The amount of
investment needed to qualify as a substantial investment shall depend on the
facts and circumstances of each applying business. As a general guideline, a
substantial investment in real property shall exist whenever the following
conditions apply:
      (1)   When new construction is involved, a building or addition of at
least 10,000 square feet in size, or two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
($250,000) in construction costs is proposed; or
      (2)   When renovation or remodeling of an existing structure is involved,
the amount of the proposed real property investment must equal or exceed ten
percent of the market value of the existing improvements located on the parcel.
The market value, not including land value, will be determined by the Madison
County tax records; or
      (3)   When an investment in personal property is contemplated, an
investment of at least ten percent of the existing personal property market
value (for tax purposes) must be proposed to qualify as a substantial
investment; or
      (4)   When an investment in real and personal property is contemplated,
an investment of at least ten percent of the real property market value, not
including land value, must be proposed to qualify as a substantial investment.
   (g)   Substantial Impact on Jobs. Any business applying for the incentives
available must, in addition to the other requirements herein, agree by contract
that its project will have a substantial positive impact on job opportunities
at the London location. To qualify as a substantial impact, an existing
business must agree that at least ten percent of the existing number of full-
time employees will be added or that all existing full-time jobs will be
retained. New businesses must agree to employ at least ten full-time persons as
a result of the investment in order to qualify as having a substantial impact
on jobs.
   (h)   Location Within the Zone. Only businesses already located or proposed
to be located within the boundaries of the Enterprise Zone designated by London
City Council may apply for a tax incentive.
   (i)   Other Requirements. In addition to the guidelines set forth herein,
any business applying must comply with all other applicable local, County and
State regulations pertaining to the Enterprise Zone Program. Applicants must
submit all information required by the City of London, Madison County or the
State of Ohio. Applicants must comply with the notice requirements of Ohio R.C.
5709.83.
   (j)   Principals Only. Only individuals who are principally involved as an
owner or manager of a business interested in the Enterprise Zone tax incentives
may negotiate with City officials regarding the specific incentives available
under the terms of any investment agreement. Landlords of property, rather than
brokers, may negotiate for tax incentives relative to real property
improvements.
   (k)   Promotion. General information about London's Enterprise Zone shall be
widely distributed and the incentives available shall be aggressively promoted
along with other attributes.
   (l)   Tax Incentive Review Council. Pursuant to State law, a Tax Incentive
Review Council will be created to monitor compliance with the terms of any
agreement approved by the City Council. This Tax Incentive Review Council shall
review all agreements to determine whether the businesses have complied with
their terms and shall make recommendations regarding them to the London City
Council. The Tax Incentive Review Council may apply to the County Commissioners
for funds available under a fund created by fees collected under Ohio R.C.
5709.632(e) and titled Fee Section of these guidelines to take care of expenses
used directly in obtaining information necessary for the Tax Incentive Review
Council to complete its obligation under this program. The Tax Incentive Review
Council shall meet yearly prior to February 1 of every year and the report must
be forwarded to the Enterprise Zone Manager by March 1. The City Council may
take any action available to a party to a contract to obtain compliance with
the agreement.
   (m)   City to Negotiate Agreements.
      (1)   The Madison County Commissioners have approved the designation of
the London Enterprise Zone. The Madison County Commissioners have employed the
London Chamber of Commerce as the manager for the Enterprise Zone. The London
Chamber of Commerce has delegated to the City of London the authority to
negotiate and administer tax incentive agreements with businesses located
therein. Therefore, all interested parties must contact the London Chamber of
Commerce who will set up the negotiations directly with the City of London.
      (2)   The negotiating committee for the London Enterprise Zone must
comply with the agreement between the City and the School Board to include a
fifty percent split of any newly generated income tax based on the Enterprise
Agreement, if the payroll for newly created positions exceeds five hundred
thousand dollars ($500,000).
(Ord. 162-94. Passed 7-21-94.)
   (n)   Fees.
      (1)   At the completion of the preliminary negotiations for an Enterprise
Agreement, the applicant must pay a five hundred dollar ($500.00) application
fee, which is to be directed to the Department of Development per statute. The
applicant shall also pay a five hundred dollar ($500.00) processing fee to the
County Commissioners which will be used for the purpose of administering and
processing the application and paying any legal expenses that might be involved
in the processing of the application.
(Ord. 184-94. Passed 9-1-94.)
      (2)   All enterprises that are subject to an agreement that has been
approved by the State shall pay an annual fee to the County Commissioners equal
to the greater of one percent of the dollar value of incentives offered under
the agreement or five hundred dollars ($500.00), provided however, that if the
value of the incentives exceeds two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
($250,000), the fee shall not exceed two thousand, five hundred dollars
($2,500). The fee shall be payable to the County Commissioners each year by
February 1. The fees paid shall be deposited in a special fund created by the
County Commissioners and shall be used by the Commissioners exclusively for the
purposes of complying with Ohio R.C. 5709.68, and by the Tax Incentive Review
Council created under Ohio R.C. 5709.85 exclusively for the purpose of
performing duties prescribed under that section.
      (3)   The County Commissioners may waive or reduce the amount of fee paid
by an Enterprise if money is available to comply with the reporting
requirements by the Enterprise Zone.
   (o)   No Duplication of Public Benefits. Any London business receiving tax-
exempt industrial revenue bonds to finance improvements to real or personal
property or the acquisition of real or personal property shall not be eligible
for the benefits of the Enterprise Zone Program. Businesses must choose between
tax-exempt bonds and Enterprise Zone tax incentives.
   (p)   Continuing Obligation. During the term of any approved agreement, the
business involved must continue to cooperate with City officials by providing
any information requested to ensure compliance with the terms of the tax
incentive agreement.
   (q)   Deadline. Pursuant to State law, the deadline for executing tax
incentive agreements shall be December 31, 1997. Any agreements negotiated
prior to that time that provide tax incentives for a period extending beyond
the deadline shall remain in full force and effect until the end of the term or
termination.
(Ord. 162-94. Passed 7-21-94.)

been discouraged.
   (b)   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3735.66, the London Historic District is hereby

State application fee requirement of Ohio R.C. 3735.672 and the local annual
monitoring fee of one percent on the amount of taxes exempted under the
agreement, but not less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) and not more than
two thousand, five hundred dollars ($2,500), annually. The monitoring fee is a
local option.

described in Ohio R.C. 3735.65 through 3735.70.
   (h)   A Community Reinvestment Area Housing Council shall be established,

   This chapter supplements the requirements and procedures contained in Ohio

streets and alleys within the City. It is not intended to replace the
requirements and procedures contained in Ohio R.C. Chapter 723.
(Ord. 105-14. Passed 2-20-14.)

any owner of property that abuts the street or alley affected shall receive
written notice of such proposed action via certified U.S. mail, return receipt
requested, or by personal service through either the City of London Police
Department or the Sheriff of Madison County. If only a portion of a street or
alley is to be renamed, vacated or narrowed, only the owners of the property
that directly abuts such portion of the street or alley shall receive the
written notice required by this section. If the owner of such property cannot
be located and served despite the best efforts of the City, then the notice
required by Ohio R.C. Chapter 723 shall suffice. If an exception to the notice

associated with the petition, including but not limited to the costs of notice
required by Ohio R.C. Chapter 723, the costs of the written notice required
herein, if any, and any fees assessed by the Madison County Auditor and the
Madison County Recorder. The petitioner shall pay any and all actual expenses

by a private testing laboratory or bring the samples to the WWTP Lab for
testing. Fees for analysis are listed in the fee schedule and will be billed to
the waste material generator requesting approval. A WEF approval will be sent
to the waste material generator and a WEF approval number must be on manifest
when wastes are brought to plant for disposal.
         B.   Contents of any industrial load(s) brought to the WWTP shall be
sampled and analyzed by contracted laboratory to confirm the contents, quality
and concentration prior to allowing the waste to enter the WWTP treatment
train. The laboratory testing fees will be added to the discharge invoice. The
Superintendent or his/her designated representative will refuse to treat the
industrial waste if in the opinion of the Superintendent or his/her designated
representative, the analyzed results shows the waste will:
            1.   Cause an upset of or interfere with WWTP operations;
            2.   Cause a violation of the WWTP's discharge permit; or
            3.   Otherwise violate the rules and regulations of the WWTP.
      (5)   City of London truck industrial waste evaluation procedures.
         A.   The Superintendent or his/her designated representative(s) will
evaluate each new industrial waste source for treatability by using the
following procedures.
            1.   The industrial waste will be evaluated first by reviewing the
WEF submitted by the waste material generator. The contents quality and
concentration of the waste will be compared to the treatability of the waste
strength; local limits compliance; interference with WWTP operations; potential
violation of the WWTP's discharge permit; or other violations of the rules and
regulations of the WWTP and NPDES.
            2.   Target treatability level will be established for each
parameter associated with, or potentially affected by, the contents of the
industrial waste. These parameter target levels will be set at no more than
fifty percent of the permit limits or local limits for each parameter.
            3.   A representative sample of the waste material will be
collected, tested and compared to the information provided by the waste
material generator on the WEF. This sample will be used to perform a bench
scale treatability test, and evaluated for the target treatability level as set
forth for each parameter associated with, or potentially affected by, the
contents of the industrial waste.
            4.   Upon completion of an acceptable bench scale test, then a full
scale test will be completed by bringing in an acceptable volume of waste
material from the waste material generator for a full scale test. The trucked
waste will be retested and the result will be compared to the sample obtained
for the bench scale test and the WEF. The full scale test will be conducted by
feeding the waste material stream to the plant at half the loading rate
indicated by the bench scale testing. When the waste material stream is feeding
to the plant process, the wastewater process will be monitored for each target
treatability level parameter associated with, or potentially affected by, the
contents of the industrial waste. If the target treatability level parameters
associated with or potentially affected by the contents of the industrial waste
are met, then a treatability report will be assigned to this waste material.
This treatability report will contain the procedures for accepting and treating
this waste material. As part of the treatability report, the maximum
concentration levels will be set for each parameter associated with, or
potentially affected by, the contents of the industrial waste. The treatability
report will be sent to the waste material generator for the waste stream along
with a waste stream approval number for that waste stream. Each waste load
brought into the WWTP will be tested and must not exceed the maximum
concentration level.
      (6)   Failed full scale testing procedures:
         A.   If during a full scale test, or any time truck industrial waste
is being fed to the WWTP, the operators notice a change in treatment process or
become concerned with treatability, or when the target treatability level
parameters associated with or potentially affected by the contents of the
industrial waste are not meeting the target limits, the operator will do the
following:
            1.   Stop the feed of the industrial waste to the plant;
            2.   Notify the Superintendent and/or foreman of the treatability
issue;
            3.   If the target limit is below the NPDES limits, start at the
effluent and work back across the process testing for the high target parameter
and record the data on plant operation check sheet. If the operator feels the
high target parameter will improve over time, the operator will inform the
Superintendent and/or foreman of the results. No other action is required at
this time.
            4.   If the target limits have exceeded the NPDES limits, or if
testing back across the process shows the results are not improving, the
operator will:
               (a)   Stop the influent pumps;
               (b)   If possible, divert the flow to the clarifier, to an off-
line clarifier and/or off-line aeration tank to stop the flow, or close the
effluent gate;
               (c)   Turn off the effluent pumps;
               (d)   Set up the City's pumps at the effluent manhole past the
UV system;
               (e)   Shut the lagoon drain valve and then start pumping the
effluent to the lagoon; and
               (f)   Call the Superintendent and foreman.
            5.   Call Allied Technical Services and order two six inch portable
trash pumps at 877-987-8677, 614-798-0349, or 419-350-2209. Install pumps at
the effluent recycle pumps feed well. Discharge to the lagoon.
            6.   Keep the flow stopped until the system has recovered and can
produce effluent that meets the discharge limits.

1049.01 OBJECTIVES; APPLICATION OF CHAPTER
   (a)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for discharges into the
London wastewater collection and treatment systems and enables the City to
protect health in conformity with all applicable local, State and Federal laws
relating thereto. The objectives of this chapter include, but are not limited
to:
      (1)   Preventing the introduction of pollutants into the City wastewater
system which will interfere with the normal operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting Municipal sludge;
      (2)   Preventing the introduction of pollutants into the City wastewater
system which have the potential to reduce treatment in the publicly-owned
treatment works (POTW), which will pass through the system into receiving
waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the system;
      (4)   To protect both POTW personnel, who may be affected by wastewater
and sludge in the course of their employment, and the general public;
      (5)   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance and improvement of the POTW;
      (6)   To enable the City to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit conditions, sludge use and disposal
requirements and any other Federal or State laws to which the POTW is subject.
   (b)   This chapter shall apply to all industrial users of the POTW. This
chapter authorizes the issuance of industrial wastewater discharge permits;
provides for monitoring, compliance and enforcement activities; establishes
administrative review and reporting procedures; and provides for the setting of
fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program
established herein.
   (c)   All sewer ordinances existing on the effective date of this chapter
shall remain in effect, unless provisions of those ordinances are altered or
addressed herein.

      (14)   Trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points
designated by the Director.
      (15)   Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of
industrial wastes.
      (16)   Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the Director
in a wastewater discharge permit.
      (17)   Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources,
the treatment plant's effluent to fail a toxicity test.
      (18)   Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances which may
cause excessive foaming in the POTW.
   (b)   Duties of Director; Prohibited Discharges. When the Director
determines that a discharger is contributing any of the above enumerated
substances in such amounts as to interfere with the operations of the POTW, the
Director shall:
      (1)   Advise the discharger of the impact of the contribution on the
POTW; and
      (2)   Develop effluent limits for such discharger to correct the
interference with the POTW.
      (3)   The Director shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental
discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to control slug
discharges. Evaluations shall be review once per control mechanism cycle.
   (c)   Limitations on Wastewater Strength.
      (1)   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards, as promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (U.S. EPA) pursuant to the Act, shall be met by all dischargers of the
regulated industrial categories. An application for modification of the
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards may be considered for submittal to
the approval authority by the Director, when the City's wastewater treatment
systems achieve consistent removal of the pollutants, as defined by 40 C.F.R.
403.7 or its successor.
      (2)   Right of revision. The City reserves the right to amend this
chapter to provide limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW, where
deemed necessary, to comply with the objectives set forth in Section
1049.01.
      (3)   Dilution. No discharger shall increase the use of potable or
process water in any way, nor mix separate waste streams, for the purpose of
diluting a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment
to achieve compliance with the standards set forth in this chapter. The
Director may impose mass limitations on dischargers which are using dilution to
meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where
the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
   (d)   Accidental Discharges.
      (1)   If determined necessary by the Director, discharger shall provide
protection (i.e. curbing, retention wall) from the accidental discharge of
prohibited or regulated materials or substances established by this chapter.
Where necessary, facilities to prevent the accidental discharge of prohibited
materials shall be provided and maintained at the discharger's cost and
expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide
this protection shall be submitted to the Director for review and shall be
approved by the Director prior to construction of the facility. Each existing
discharger shall complete its detailed plan, complete forms provided by the
City and submit the same to the Director within 30 days. No discharger who
discharges to the POTW after the aforesaid date shall be permitted to introduce
pollutants into the system until accidental discharge protection procedures
have been approved by the Director. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures by the Director shall not relieve the discharger from the
responsibility to modify its facilities as necessary to meet the requirements
of this chapter.
      (2)   Dischargers shall verbally notify the Director immediately upon the
occurrence of a slugload or accidental discharge of substances prohibited by
this chapter, with a written notification letter to follow within two working
days. Both notifications shall include the location of the discharge, the date
and time thereof, the type of waste, the concentration and volume and
corrective actions. Any discharger who discharges a slugload of prohibited
materials shall be liable for any expense, loss or damage to the POTW, in
addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the authority on account thereof
under State or Federal law.
      (3)   Signs shall be permanently posted, in conspicuous places on the
discharger's premises, advising employees whom to call in the event of a
slugload or accidental discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who
may cause or discover such a discharge with respect to emergency notification
procedures.
   (e)   Bypass Not Violating Applicable Pretreatment Standards or
Requirements. A discharger may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provisions of division (f) and (g) of this section. Notification
must be made to the City within one day or less of the bypass.
   (f)   Prohibition of Bypass.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take enforcement action
against a discharger for a bypass, unless:
         A.   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage;
         B.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, the retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
         C.   The discharger submitted notices as required under division (G)
of this section.
      (2)   The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet the three
conditions listed in division (f)(1).
   (g)   Notice.
      (1)   If a discharger knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Director, if possible, at least ten days before the
date of the bypass.
      (2)   A discharger shall provide oral notice of an unanticipated bypass
that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the Director within 24 hours
from the time the discharger becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission
shall also be provided within five days of the time the discharger becomes
aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and
times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent a recurrence of the bypass. The Director may waive the written
submission on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within
24 hours.
   (h)   Hauled Wastewater. City residents' recreational vehicles may discharge
at the POTW, with the permission of the Director or authorised plant personnel.

Proposed new industrial dischargers shall apply least 90 days prior to
connecting to or contributing to the POTW. In support of the application, the
industrial discharger shall submit, in units and terms appropriate for
evaluation, the information listed in division (B)(2) of this section. The
Director shall evaluate the data furnished by the discharger and may require
additional information. After evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished,
the Director may issue a wastewater discharge permit, subject to terms and
conditions provided herein. The Director reserves the right to request
additional information where reasonable. The Director reserves the right to
deny or condition new or increased contributions of pollutants or change of
pollutants for all dischargers at any time.
      (4)   Standards modification. The BPU reserves the right to amend this
chapter and the terms and conditions thereof in order to assure compliance by
the City with applicable laws and regulations. Upon notification of changes in
the of a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, this chapter and/or the
wastewater discharge permit subject to such standards shall be amended to
require compliance by dischargers with such standards within the time frame
prescribed by such standards. Where a discharger subject to a National
Categorical Pretreatment Standard has not previously submitted a baseline
report, as required by division (B)(2) of this section, and/or an application,
as required by division (B)(3) of this section, the discharger shall file a
baseline report and/or apply for a wastewater discharge permit with the
Director within 60 days after the promulgation of the applicable National
Categorical Pretreatment Standards by the U.S. EPA. In addition, any discharger
operating on the basis of a previous filing of a baseline report and/or
wastewater discharge permit shall submit to the City, within 60 days after the
promulgation of an applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the
additional information required by divisions (B)(2)(h) and (i) of this section.
The discharger shall be informed of any proposed changes in this chapter at
least 30 days prior to the effective date of change. Any changes or new
conditions in this chapter shall include a reasonable time schedule for

compliance with this chapter.
      (6)   Permit duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time
period, not to exceed five years. The industrial discharger shall apply for
permit re- issuance a minimum of 180 days prior to the expiration of the
industrial discharger's existing permit. The terms and conditions of the
permit, including the limitations and/or requirements identified in Section
1049.03, may be modified if a just cause exists. The industrial discharger
shall be informed of any proposed changes in its permit at least 30 days prior
to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit
shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
      (7)   Permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a
specific industrial discharger for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge
permit shall not be reassigned, transferred or sold to a new owner, a new
industrial discharger, a different premises or a new or changed operation
without the approval of the City. Any succeeding owner or industrial discharger
shall also comply with the terms and conditions of the existing permit.
   (c)   Compliance Reports.
      (1)   Compliance date report.
         A.   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or, in the case of a new source,
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
discharger subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the Director a report containing information as indicated in division (B)(5)(d)
through (f) of this section. The report shall state whether the applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and,
if not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is
necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements. New sources shall install and have in
operating condition, and shall start-up, all pollution control equipment
required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to
discharge. Within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed ninety days), new
sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards.
         B.   For dischargers subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established by the Director in accordance with the procedures in 40
C.F.R. 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the
discharger's long-term production rate. For all other dischargers subject to
categorical pretreatment standards, expressed in terms of allowable pollutant
discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report
shall include the discharger's actual production during the appropriate
sampling period. This period shall be signed by an authorized representative of
the discharger.
      (2)   Periodic compliance reports.
         A.   Any discharger subject to a pretreatment standard set forth in
this chapter, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in
the case of a new discharger, after commencement of the discharge to the City,
shall submit to the Director during the months of June and December, unless
required more frequently by the Director, a report indicating the nature and
concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent which are
limited by the pretreatment standards hereof and any documentation indicating
compliance with any best management practices when determined to be necessary.
In addition, this report shall include a record of all measured or estimated
average and maximum daily flows during the reporting period. Flows shall be
reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided, however, that where cost
or feasibility considerations justify, the Director may accept reports of
average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The City, for
good cause shown, considering such factors as local high or low flow rates,
holidays, budget cycles or other extenuating factors, may authorize the
submission of such reports on months other than those specified above. Reports
from dischargers must be signed by an authorized representative of the
discharger. All sampling results obtained by the discharger shall be reported
to the Director, including any sampling performed more frequently than
required. Dischargers shall notify the Director, in writing, within 24 hours if
any sampling results violate applicable pretreatment limits. The discharger
shall repeat the sampling and analysis for those parameters in violation and
shall resubmit the results within 30 days of becoming aware of the violation.
         B.   Reports of dischargers shall contain all results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration,
or the production and mass, and any documentation associated with best
management practices established where required by the City. The frequency of
monitoring by the discharger shall be as prescribed in the applicable
pretreatment standard of this chapter. All analyses shall be performed in
accordance with 40 C.F.R. 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 C.F.R. 136 does
not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the U.S. EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for
Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April, 1977, and
amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures
approved by the Administrator of the U.S. EPA. The user must collect wastewater
samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless
time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the
Director. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the City, the samples must be representative of the discharge,
losing protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part
136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-
hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide,
total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or
in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be
composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected
by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may
be authorized by the City, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. Samples for oil and
grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic
compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. For sampling
required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports
required, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities
for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which
historical sampling data are available, the Director may authorize a lower
minimum.
         C.   In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with
a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user
must submit documentation required by the director or the pretreatment standard
necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
      (3)   Reporting requirernents for dischargers not subject to categorical
pretreatment standards. The Director shall require appropriate reporting from
those dischargers with discharges that are not subject to categorical
pretreatment standards.
      (4)   Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
ordinance shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this ordinance, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with best management practices established.
Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and
the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were
performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods
used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available
for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically
extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the City, or
where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by
the Director.
   (d)   Monitoring Facilities (Sampling Manhole).
      (1)   Each discharger shall provide and operate, at the discharger's own
expense, a sampling manhole to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement
of each sewer discharge to the City. Each sampling manhole shall be situated on
the discharger's premises, except that where such a location would be
impractical or cause undue hardship on the discharger, the City may permit the
sampling manhole to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area,
provided that the location will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
      (2)   There should be ample room in or near such sampling manhole to
allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The sampling
and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition, at the expense of the discharger.
      (3)   All sampling manholes shall be constructed and maintained in
accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
Construction shall be completed within 120 days of receipt of a permit therefor
by the discharger or a time frame agreed to by the Director for extension.
      (4)   A sampling weir box would be an acceptable alternative to a
sampling manhole, as long as access to this weir box can be made at any time by
the City.
   (e)   Inspection and Sampling.
      (1)   The City may inspect the monitoring facilities of any discharger to
determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter. The discharger
shall allow the Director or his or her representatives to enter upon the
premises of the discharger at all reasonable hours, for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, examining and/or copying records. The City shall have the
right to set up on the discharger's property such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
      (2)   Where a discharger has security measures in force which would
require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
discharger shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that,
upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the City will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.
   (f)   Pretreatment.
      (1)   Industrial dischargers shall provide necessary wastewater
treatment, as required to comply with this chapter, and shall achieve
compliance with all National Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time
limitations specified by the National Pretreatment Regulations. Any facilities
required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the City shall be
provided, operated and maintained at the discharger's expense.
      (2)   Detailed plans showing the industrial discharger's pretreatment
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the City for review,
and shall be acceptable to the City before construction of the facility. Plans
shall be designed by a qualified professional engineer. The review of such
plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the discharger from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent
acceptable to the City under the provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent
changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported
to and be acceptable to the City prior to the discharger's initiation of the
changes.
   (g)   Confidential Information.
      (1)   Information and dates furnished to the City by the industrial waste
questionnaire forms, with respect to the nature and frequency of discharges,
shall be available to the public or any governmental agency without
restriction, unless the discharger specifically requests and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets of the discharger.
      (2)   When requested by a discharger furnishing a report, the portions of
a report which may disclose trade secrets shall not be made available for
inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon written request to
governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the NPDES permit, the
State disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs, provided,
however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the State
or any State agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the
discharger furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics
will not be recognized as confidential information.
   (h)   Reporting Requirements for City. The City will forward pertinent
information regarding changes in the National Pretreatment Categorical
Standards to industries affected if the information received by the City from

industrial waste, from the Public Service Director, that violates an IU permit
or these Codified Ordinances and that causes system problems to the collection
system or the POTW, as issued under this chapter.
   (b)   Authority of the Director. The Director shall administer the
enforcement of this chapter, with approval of the Board of Public Utilities.
The Director will decide the enforcement action required for all IUs who have
violated their permit or this chapter.
      (1)   An NOV shall be sent to an IU violator who has not complied with
its permit or this chapter or who has not taken corrective action. Within ten
working days of the NOV, as dated, the IU must respond, in writing, to the
Director outlining any action to correct the violation. Any noncomplying IU who

      (2)   Make decisions based on the facts and/or reasons presented for the
violation before rendering enforcement action.
      (3)   Require IU discharger who allows or causes an unauthorized
discharge to enter the collection system and/or POTW shall show cause before
the Director why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
      (4)   Terminate IU permits to discharge to the sewer system for any
reason, as set forth in this chapter, 40 C.F.R. 403 or the Ohio Administrative
Code (OAC Chapter 3745).
      (5)   Authorize the re-connection of sewer service for IU violators.

IU violator to follow, as set forth in this chapter.
   (d)   Notification of Violation: Administrative Adjustment. Whenever the
Director finds that any discharger has engaged in conduct which justifies
termination of water service, pursuant to division (e) of this section, the
Director shall serve or cause to be served upon such discharger a written
notice to the signature official or any agent of the corporation, either
personally or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested,
stating the nature of the alleged violation. If the certified mail envelope is
returned with an endorsement showing that the envelope was refused or
unclaimed, or if, after making a reasonable effort, the City is unable to
personally serve the discharger, then the City shall send by ordinary mail
written notice stating the nature of the alleged violation upon such
discharger, the signature official or any agent of the corporation. Service by
regular mail shall be deemed complete when the fact of mailing is noted in the
discharger's file. Within 30 days of the date of receipt of the notice, the
discharger shall respond, personally or in writing, to the Director, advising
of its position with respect to the allegations. Thereafter, the parties shall
meet to ascertain the veracity of the allegations and, where necessary,
establish a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof.
   (e)   Show Cause. The Director may order any industrial discharger who
causes or allows an unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW to show cause
before the Director why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A
notice shall be served on the industrial discharger specifying regarding the
violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken and the proposed
enforcement action, and directing the industrial discharger to show cause
before the Director in writing within ten days why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of Show Cause shall be served personally
or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. If the certified
mail envelope is returned with an endorsement showing that the envelope was
refused or unclaimed, or if, after making a reasonable effort, the City is
unable to personally serve the discharger, then the City shall send, by
ordinary mail, written notice stating the nature of the alleged violation upon
such discharger, the signature official or any agent of the corporation.
Service by regular mail shall be deemed complete when the fact of mailing is
noted in the discharger's file. Service may be made on any agent or officer of
a corporation. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate
may be issued.
   (f)   Emergency Suspension or Halting of Service or Discharge Permits. The
Director may, for good cause shown, suspend or immediately halt wastewater
treatment service and/or a wastewater discharge permit to a discharger when it
appears to the Director that an actual or threatened discharge presents or
threatens an imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of
persons, substantial danger to the environment, interference with the operation
of the POTW, or a violation of any pretreatment limits imposed by this chapter.
Any discharger notified of the suspension or the halt of the City's wastewater
treatment service shall, within a reasonable period of time, as determined by
the Director, cease all discharges. In the event of a failure of the discharger
to comply voluntarily with the suspension order or the halt order within the
specified time, the Director shall commence judicial proceedings immediately
thereafter to compel the discharger's compliance with such order. The Director
shall reinstate wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater discharge
permit and terminate any judicial proceedings upon proof by the discharger of
the elimination of the noncompliant discharge or conditions creating the threat
of imminent or substantial danger, as set forth above.
   (g)   Termination of Services or Revocation of Discharge Permits. The
Director may terminate wastewater treatment services or revoke wastewater
discharge permits for any discharger:
      (1)   Who fails to factually report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (2)   Who fails to report significant changes in wastewater constituents
or characteristics; or
      (3)   Who fails to permit reasonable access to the discharger's premises
by representatives of the City for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or
      (4)   Who violates the provisions of this chapter, including any repeated
or continued noncompliance or any final judicial order entered with respect
thereto.
   (h)   Effective Date of Decisions. The decision of the Director will become
final five days after such order, unless the Director finds that the immediate
effect of such order is necessary for the preservation of the collection system
or the POTW and so certifies on the record. The Director order will be hand
delivered to the affected IU by the Director or his or her designee. If the IU
business is closed, the order will be sent by registered mail, with return
receipt requested, and a follow-up by the Director shall be made.
   (i)   Judicial Proceedings. Following the entry of any order by the City,
with respect to the conduct of a discharger contrary to the provisions of this
chapter, the Law Director may, following the authorization of such action by
the City, commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in
the appropriate local court.
   (j)   Annual Publication of List of Noncompliant Industrial Users. The
Director shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that
provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW,

oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
      (3)   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by Section
1049.06(A)(13) (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or
narrative standard) that the Director determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
      (4)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Superintendent's
exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;

appeal to the Board of Public Utilities any ruling by the Director on any
matter covered by this chapter. A written response to an appeal will be issued
as timely as possible. In the event that an inquiry by an industrial discharger
deals with matters of performance or compliance with this chapter for which
enforcement activity relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt
of an industrial discharger's appeal shall stay all enforcement proceedings
pending receipt of the aforesaid written reply. Appeal of any final
administrative order entered pursuant to this chapter may be taken in
accordance with local and State law. The appellant may appeal, to the
appropriate local court, any decision of the Director, by perfecting such as
provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506. The Law Director will represent the
Director in judicial proceedings.
   (l)   Operating Upsets.
      (1)   Any discharger who experiences an upset in operations which places
the discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance with this chapter shall
inform the Director thereof within 24 hours of first awareness of the
commencement of the upset. Where such information is given orally, a written
follow-up report thereof shall be filed by the discharger with the Director

impair or interfere with existing provisions of other laws or ordinances,
except those specifically repealed by these Regulations, with private
restrictions placed upon property by deed, covenant or other private agreement,

application of the requirements of these Regulations would result in real
difficulties, substantial hardship or injustice, such requirements may be
varied or modified so that the subdivider may subdivide his or her property in
a reasonable manner; but at the same time, the public welfare and interest of
the Municipality and the surrounding area are to be thoroughly protected and
the general intent and spirit of these Regulations are to be enforced.
   (b)   The requirements of these Regulations may also be modified and varied
whenever a plat is for a complete community or neighborhood, but any such
variance must insure that adequate public spaces, circulation, recreation,
light and air will be provided and that the needs of the entire community, when

been recorded in the office of the County Recorder, shall be fined not less
than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00)
for each lot, parcel or tract so sold. The description of such lot, parcel or

seller from the forfeiture provided in this section. Such sum shall be
recovered with costs in a civil action, in the name of the Municipality for the
use of the Municipality.

   (b)   Filing. The subdivider shall prepare and file an application for
preliminary approval with the Planning Commission and as many copies of the
preliminary plan as may be required by the Commission according to the
standards and other provisions of these Regulations. The preliminary plan shall
be considered officially filed after it is examined by the Safety-Service
Director for the Commission and is found to be in full compliance with the
formal provisions set forth in Section
1224.02.
   (c)   Approval. The Safety-Service Director shall forward copies of the
preliminary plan to such officials and agencies as may be directed by the
Commission for the purpose of study and recommendation. The Safety-Service
Director shall also forward a notice to all of the property owners immediately
adjacent or across the street from the proposed subdivision that the
subdivision has been filed and any concerned property owner may review the plat
and the property owner shall also receive notice of the hearing in which the
Planning Commission shall hear the proposal for the preliminary plan for the
subdivision. After receipt of reports from such officials and agencies the
Commission shall determine whether the preliminary map shall be approved,
approved with modifications or disapproved. Notice of such action shall be
forwarded to the subdivider or any concerned property owner who has requested
the information.
   The Commission shall act on the preliminary plan within forty-five days
after filing unless such time is extended by agreement with the subdivider or
his or her agent.
   When a preliminary plan has been approved by the Commission, the Chairperson
of the Commission shall affix his or her signature to the plan and attach
thereto a notation that it has received preliminary approval and return one
copy to the subdivider for compliance with final approval requirements.
Approval of the preliminary plat by the Commission shall not constitute
approval of the final plan of the subdivision by the Commission.
   Preliminary approval shall confer upon the subdivider the right for a one
year period from the date of approval that the general terms and conditions
under which the preliminary approval was granted will not be affected by any
changes and/or amendments to these Regulations. Where preliminary approval has
been granted for a subdivider, and the subdivision to be developed in phases,
the following time frames will be respected: Initial preliminary approval will
be good as long as the development starts within one year of the date of
approval. If the developer stops development for a period of two years or more,
then the preliminary approval process shall begin again with the preliminary
plat being resubmitted.

may be deemed necessary for public requirements.
      (2)   The street and alley arrangement shall be such as not to cause
hardship to owners of adjoining property when they plat their own land and seek
to provide for convenient access to it. Residential streets shall be designed
so as to discourage through traffic, but offset streets should be avoided.
      (3)   The angle of intersection between minor streets and major streets
should not vary by more than ten degrees from a right angle. All other streets
should intersect each other as near to a right angle as possible, and no
intersection of streets at angles of less than seventy degrees shall be
permitted.
      (4)   Residential streets shall be designed to discourage through traffic
which may otherwise use secondary or major highways and whose origin and
destination are not within the subdivision. Residential streets extending for
considerable distance, parallel to any secondary or major street, should be
avoided.
   (b)   Alignment.
      (1)   Vertical. For main thoroughfares, profile grades shall be connected
by vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent to twenty times the algebraic
difference between the rates of grade, expressed in feet per hundred; for
secondary and minor streets and alleys, fifteen times.
      (2)   Minimum horizontal. Radii of center line curvature shall be:
            Main thoroughfares, twelve degrees - 475 feet;
            Secondary thoroughfares, nineteen degrees - 300 feet;
            Minor streets, twenty-eight degrees - 200 feet;
            Streets shorter than 500 feet, fifty-eight degrees - 100 feet.
            A minimum fifty-foot tangent shall be introduced between traverse
curves.
      (3)   Visibility requirements.
         A.   Minimum vertical visibility (measured four and one-half feet eye
level to tail light eighteen inches above ground level) shall be: 500 feet on
main thoroughfares; 300 feet on secondary thoroughfares; 200 feet on minor
streets; 100 feet on streets shorter than 500 feet.
         B.   Minimum horizontal visibility shall be: 500 feet on main
thoroughfares, measured on the centerline; 300 feet on secondary thoroughfares,
measured on the centerline; 100 feet on all other streets, measured on the
centerline.
   (c)   Street and Alley Width.
      (1)   Conformance. The width of all major thoroughfares shall conform to
the width designated on the Official Thoroughfare Plan.
      (2)   Widths specified. The minimum right-of-way widths for streets and
alleys are as follows:
 
Type of Street or Way                       * Minimum Right-of-way Width (ft.)
Major streets and highways                  variable**
Secondary or collector streets              60*
Minor or local urban streets                60
Rural roads and streets serving low density 60
suburban development
Alleys                                      20
Crosswalk                                   10
 
*   More right of way may be required where projected traffic counts and/or
roadside ditches are used in place of curbs and gutters.
**   To be determined by the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Cul-de-sacs. Each cul-de-sac shall be provided with a turn-around
having a minimum right-of-way radius of fifty-six feet. The outside of the road
surface within the turn-around right of way shall have a minimum radius of
forty-five feet.
      (4)   Dead-end streets. Streets designated to be dead-ended permanently
shall not be permitted. Any dead-end street of a temporary nature, if longer
than 200 feet or fronted by existing lots, shall have a surfaced turning area
equal in diameter to the width of such street at its termination.
      (5)   Half streets. Dedication of half streets shall be discouraged.
Where there exists a dedicated or platted half street or alley adjacent to the
tract being subdivided, the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary by
the Commission.
      (6)   Alleys. Alleys should be avoided in single or two-family districts.
They may, however, be required in multiple dwelling developments where they
should have a minimum width of twenty feet. Alleys are required in the rear of
all commercial and industrial lots if no other provisions are made for adequate
service access or for parking. The rights of way of such alleys shall not be
less than twenty feet and dead-end alleys shall not be permitted.
      (7)   Street grades (vertical curves). No street grade shall be less than
four-tenths percent and shall not exceed the following with due allowances for
reasonable vertical curves:
         Main or arterial thoroughfare   5%
         Secondary thoroughfare   6%
         Minor streets         8%
      (8)   Street grades (cross-section). The gradients of streets shall be
not less than 0.5 percent without curb and gutter and 0.3 percent with curb and
gutter. On streets where curbs, gutters and sidewalks are not required, there
shall be a berm, the width of which shall be determined by the applicable
street cross-section which is a part of the major thoroughfare plan.
      (9)   Street names. Where new names are required for new streets in
unincorporated areas, the names shall meet with the approval of the County
Engineer.
(Ord. 1368. Passed 4-6-61; Ord. 146-82. Passed 11-4-82; Ord. 195-96. Passed 11-
7-96.)
1226.03 BLOCKS AND LOTS.
   (a)   Block Design.
      (1)   No block shall be longer than 1,200 feet nor less than 500 feet,
except in unusual circumstances. Where a subdivision adjoins a major highway,
the greater dimension of the block shall front along such major highway to
minimize the number of points of ingress or egress.
      (2)   Where blocks are over 750 feet in length, a crosswalk easement not
less than ten feet in width may be required if necessary to provide proper
access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers and other facilities.
   (b)   Lots.
      (1)   The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will
provide satisfactory and desirable building sites properly related to
topography and the character of surrounding development.
      (2)   All side lines of lots shall be at approximate right angles to
straight street lines and radial to curved street lines except where a
variation to this rule will provide a better street and lot layout. Depth in
relation to width shall not exceed three to one.
      (3)   No lot shall have less area or width than is required by the zoning
regulations applying to the area in which it is located.
      (4)   In case of unusual soil conditions or other physical factors which
may impair the health and safety of the neighborhood in which a subdivision may
be located, upon recommendation of the County Board of Health or upon the
recommendation of the Safety-Service Director or the County Engineer, the
Commission may require larger lot widths and lot areas as may be necessary.
      (5)   No corner lot shall have width at the building line of less then
seventy-five feet. Either of the two sides of a corner lot fronting on a street
may be designated the front of a lot, provided the rear yard shall always be
opposite the frontage so designated,
      (6)   All corner lots, be they at the intersection of the rights of way
of two streets or of an alley and a street, shall have a curve with a minimum
radius of twenty-five feet joining the two side lines of such rights of way.
(Ord. 1368. Passed 4-6-61; Ord. 146-82. Passed 11-4-82.)
1226.04 BUILDING LINES AND EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Building Lines. Where the subdivided area is not under zoning control
and is to be used for residential purposes, the building lines shall be
established according to the following table, but in no case shall the front
building line be less than thirty-five feet from the right of way of the street
or thoroughfare upon which the lots front.
      Minimum Distance
   Lot Area   from Building Line to Road
   (sq. ft.)   Right of Way (ft.)
   Over 20,000   45
   12,001 to 20,000   40
   12,000 or less   35
   Restrictions requiring greater setbacks than the above may be required for
commercial and industrial uses as determined by the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Easements. An easement normally shall have a minimum width of five
feet on each side of a lot line, or such additional width as may be necessary
for access to the utilities involved. Along both sides of an alley a two-foot
easement shall be required to accommodate pole lines. Easements shall, when
possible, follow the side and rear lot lines except under special circumstances
when they may be located elsewhere, subject to approval of the Planning
Commission or the County Engineer in the unincorporated areas. For lots facing
on curvilinear streets, rear easements, when provided, should consist of
straight lines with a minimum number of points of deflection. Easements may
also be required along or across lots where engineering design or special
conditions may necessitate the installation of water and sewer lines outside
public rights of way.
   (c)   Easement Along Streams. Whenever any stream or important surface
drainage course is located in the area being subdivided, the subdivider shall
provide an adequate easement along each side of the stream for the purpose of
widening, deepening, relocating, improving or protecting the stream for
drainage or public use.
(Ord. 1368. Passed 4-6-61.)
1226.05 PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section 1226.05 was repealed by implication due to the
passage of Ordinance 115-03, passed October 2, 2003, which created
Chapter 1230, Park Land and Open Space Dedication. See
Chapter 1230 for park land and open space provisions.)
1226.06 VARIANCES.
   Where topography and other physical conditions make full compliance with the
subdivision design standards of this chapter an undue hardship upon the owner,
the Planning Commission may refer the problem of compliance to the Safety-
Service Director, if the proposed subdivision is within the corporate limits of
the City, and to the County Engineer, if the proposed subdivision is located in
an unincorporated area, for recommendations as to permissible variances.

1228.01 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   Prior to the granting of final approval of the subdivision, the subdivider
shall install or shall furnish bond as set forth in Section
1228.09 for the installation of the improvements listed and described in this
chapter. All of the required improvements shall be made in full compliance with
the specifications for each of the various units of work, as required by the
Safety-Service Director, the County Engineer, the County Sanitary Engineer or
the County Board of Health, according to the nature of the improvements.
(Ord. 106-83. Passed 3-3-83.)
1228.02 RESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS.
   Street improvements and the installation of water lines, sanitary sewers and
storm drainage facilities within the corporate limits of the City shall be made
in full compliance with specifications and requirements of the Safety-Service
Director and the Board of Public Utilities. Street improvements and the
installation of storm drainage facilities in unincorporated areas shall be made
subject to the approval of the County Engineer. Installation of water lines and
individual or collective sewage disposal facilities shall be made in accordance
with the standards and requirements of the County Sanitary Engineer, the County
Board of Health and the Board of Public Utilities.
(Ord. 106-83. Passed 3-3-83.)
1228.03 STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
   All streets, thoroughfares, curbs, and gutters, shall be graded to their
full width, including side slopes, and improved in accordance with the
standards outlined or referred to in the current Construction and Material
Specifications of the State Department of Transportation.
(Ord. 218-23. Passed 10-19-23.)
1228.04 SIDEWALKS.
   Concrete sidewalks having minimum thickness of four inches shall be
installed along both sides of major streets or thoroughfares. In other
instances, the Planning Commission may require such sidewalks and multi-use
paths as it deems necessary to provide for the safety of pedestrians in walking
to schools or similar major destinations. Concrete sidewalks and multi-use
paths shall be constructed in conformity with the current edition of
Construction and Material Specifications of the State Department of
Transportation, and comply with current ADA Regulations, as they pertain to
this type of improvement. The location of all sidewalks and multi-use paths
shall be determined by the Commission. The minimum width of sidewalks shall be
four feet. The minimum width of multi-use paths shall be ten feet. Once
seventy-five percent of all lots in a platted subdivision, or any phase
thereof, have been sold or otherwise transferred by the subdivider to another
party, the subdivider must construct and complete the sidewalks and multi-use
paths on the remaining unsold lots in that subdivision or phase thereof.
(Ord. 106-83. Passed 3-3-83; Ord. 172-02. Passed 11-7-02; Ord. 106-13. Passed

Passed 5-18-23.)
1228.05 DRAINAGE.
   All necessary facilities, including underground pipe, inlets, catch basins
or open drainage ditches, as determined by the Safety-Service Director or the
County Engineer, depending upon jurisdiction, shall be installed to provide for
the adequate disposal of subsurface and surface water and maintenance of
natural drainage courses. All storm drainage facilities within the subdivision
shall connect to an adequate drainage course.
   (a)   Storm Sewers and Storm Water Drainage. A drainage system adequate to
serve the needs of the proposed new streets and the entire subdivision will be
required in new subdivisions. Where an adequate public storm sewer main is
available at the plat boundary, the subdivider shall construct a storm sewer
system and connect with such storm sewer main. If such storm sewer systems are
not accessible, adequate storm water drainage shall be provided by natural
drainage channels with easements of adequate width.
   (b)   Culverts and Bridges. When natural drainage channels intersect any
street right of way, it shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to have
satisfactory bridges and culverts designed and constructed. Where culverts are
required, the following minimum requirements shall be observed:
      (1)   All culverts shall extend across the entire right-of-way width of
the proposed road. The cover over the culvert and its capacity shall be
determined by the Safety-Service Director, the County Engineer or the State
Transportation Department, depending upon jurisdiction. The minimum diameter of
a culvert pipe shall be twelve inches. Head walls, depending on existing
drainage conditions, may be required.
      (2)   Driveway culvert installations shall be discouraged. Storm sewers,
with drop inlets at driveways, shall be installed unless topography conditions
do not permit storm sewer installation. Driveway culverts, if installed, shall
be a minimum of twenty feet in length and a minimum of twelve inches in
diameter, subject to review by the Director.
   (c)   Standards and Specifications for Drainage Facilities. The Stormwater
Design Manual, as published by the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission,
Columbus, Ohio, 1977 (or the most recent issue) shall govern all drainage
improvements. The following list of criteria is a general guide for the
interpretation of the Manual:
      (1)   In general. A proposed development which will increase rates or
volumes of run-off shall be required to control the discharge of run-off prior
to release to off-site lands.
      (2)   Exemptions. A single-family residential land use and subdivisions
for single-family residential purposes, not involving the construction of
public or private streets, and with a lot size of one-third of an acre or
greater and an average maximum of thirty percent impervious, are exempt from
the run-off control criteria.
      (3)   Waiver or reduction of control criteria. Development situations may
arise such that site conditions, location, design aspects and/or prior
considerations indicate that the project will not have any or will have few of
the harmful effects associated with increases in run-off rates and volumes. For
such cases, the project engineer shall submit sufficient information for the
City Engineer to determine if a waiver or reduction of run-off control criteria
is justified (in writing and clearly detailing all aspects of the proposed
development). Additional information or calculations requested by the City
Engineer shall also be submitted by the applicant. The decision to grant a
waiver or reduction of run-off control criteria shall be made by the City
Engineer. The City Engineer shall give, in writing, to the Safety-Service
Director, reasons for approving or not approving a reduction of run-off control
criteria.
      (4)   Run-off control design frequency.
         Increase in Two-year         Control Design
         Rate of Run-off         Frequency
         1-2 times            10-year
         2-3 times            25-year
         3-4 times            50-year
         over 4 times            100-year
         The maximum allowable release rate shall be based on the two-year
storm under predeveloped (not existing) site conditions, for all rainfall
events up to and including the twenty-five year storm. Facilities designed for
fifty or 100-year frequency multi-stage outlets, which are designed to control
the fifty or 100-year storm to pre-development rates, shall be approved. All
control facilities shall be designed with overflow provisions to handle the
proposed 100-year discharge.
      (5)   Storm sewers. Storm sewers shall be designed pursuant to Section
1476.15  of the City of London Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 106-83. Passed 3-3-83; Ord. 239-23. Passed 12-7-23.)
1228.06 WATER LINES AND WATER SUPPLY.
   (a)   Public Water Supply. Where public water supply is available as
determined by the Board of Public Utilities, the subdivider or developer shall
observe all the requirements as set forth by Council and the Board of Public
Utilities.
   (b)   Individual Water Supply. Where public water supply is not available,
the subdivider shall supply acceptable evidence of the availability of water.
The subdivider may be required to make one or more test wells in the area to be
platted if such evidence is deemed not acceptable.
   Copies of well logs which are obtained shall include the name and address of
the well driller and shall be submitted with the plat to the Planning
Commission.
   (c)   Location and Construction of Individual Private Wells. Individual
private wells shall comply with the specifications of the Madison County Board
of Health.
   In all cases where it has been determined that individual water supplies
from private wells are not feasible, a public water distribution system shall
be required.
   (d)   Public Water Distribution Systems. Public wells and other public water
distribution systems shall meet the requirements of the State Department of
Health.
(Ord. 106-83. Passed 3-3-83.)
1228.07 SANITARY SEWERS.
   (a)   Public Sanitary Sewers; Septic Tanks. If a subdivision can reasonably
be served by the extension of an existing public sanitary sewer, as determined
by the Board of Public Utilities, the subdivider or developer shall provide a
system of sanitary sewer mains and shall provide lateral connections for each
lot. Where a public sanitary sewer is not reasonably accessible, the
subdivider, the owner or the developer may provide septic tanks for each lot,
provided that such septic tanks are installed in accordance with State and
County or local Board of Health requirements. Whenever main lines are
installed, sewer and water mains shall be extended to property lines of the
subdivision. Connections to public sanitary sewer lines shall be subject to the
approval of and according to the specifications of the Board of Public
Utilities or the County Sanitary Engineer, depending upon jurisdiction.
   (b)   Individual Sewage Disposal Facilities. In the event the installation
of disposal systems is considered, the subdivider shall confer with officials
of the Madison County Board of Health as to the requirements and procedures to
be observed.
(Ord. 106-83. Passed 3-3-83.)
1228.08 MONUMENTS AND "AS-BUILT" PLANS.
   Permanent monuments shall be accurately set and established at the
intersections of all outside boundary lines of the plat; at intersections of
these boundary lines with all street lines at diagonally opposite corners of
each street intersection; at the beginning and end of all curves; at points on
curves where the radius or direction changes; and at such other points as are
necessary to establish definitely all lines of the plat, except those outlining
individual lots. In general, permanent monuments shall be placed at all
critical points necessary to correctly lay out any lot in the subdivision.
Monuments shall consist of one inch iron pins or other approved type of
monuments not less than twenty-four inches long.
   The City shall also receive from the developer all of the original plans of
the improvements (ink or mylar) and showing all improvements "as-built."
(Ord. 106-83. Passed 3-3-83.)
1228.09 IMPROVEMENT BOND.
   (a)   Subdivisions Within the Corporate Limits. The improvements and
standards heretofore described in this chapter, insofar as they apply to
subdivisions located within the corporate limits of the City, have been adopted
by Council, and no final or official plat of any subdivision shall be approved

(Ord. 106-83. Passed 3-3-83.)
1228.10 PROVISIONS FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION.
   Where the subdivision contains sewers, sewage treatment plants, water supply
systems, park areas, street trees or other physical facilities necessary or
desirable for the welfare of the area, which are of common use or benefit and
which are of such character that the Municipality, County or other public
agency does not desire to maintain them, then provision shall be made by trust
agreements which are a part of the deed restrictions and which are acceptable
to the Planning Commission for the proper and continuous maintenance and
supervision of such facilities by the lot owners in the subdivisions.
   Any portion of the drainage system, including on-site and off-site storage
facilities, that is constructed by the developer will be continuously
maintained by the owner subsequent in title of the affected land unless it is
officially accepted by the Safety-Service Director for City maintenance. The
developer shall cause the maintenance obligation to be inserted in the chain of
title to the affected land as a covenant running with the land in favor of the
City.
(Ord. 106-83. Passed 3-3-83.)
1228.11 VARIANCES.
   Where topography and other physical conditions make full compliance with the
minimum required improvements of this chapter an undue hardship upon the owner,
the Planning Commission may refer the problem of compliance to the Safety-
Service Director or the County Engineer, depending upon jurisdiction, for
recommendations as to permissible variances.
(Ord. 106-83. Passed 3-3-83.)
1228.12 STREET SIGNS.

shall be required at all entrances to complexes. At no point shall the distance
between hydrants exceed 300 feet. If buildings are equipped with a sprinkler
system, a fire hydrant shall be placed in such a manner as to provide for the
convenience of fire equipment placement, not to exceed 40 feet from the Fire
Department connection, and shall be fed from a City water main separate from
the sprinkler loop system. If protective posts are installed near hydrants, the
posts shall not be located any closer than two feet from the fire hydrant and
shall be positioned in such a manner as not to block any of the fire hydrant
outlets.
   (c)   Water Supply. The minimum size of any water line serving any fire
hydrant shall be six inches in diameter and should be a circulating water line.
The size and location of water lines should be approved by the Safety-Service
Director, the Fire Chief or the person responsible for fire protection, and the
Ohio Inspection Bureau for commercial and industrial subdivisions.
   (d)   Additional Hydrants. Additional fire hydrants shall be purchased or
provided by the subdivider/developer to the City as follows:

1230.01 FINDINGS.
   Council hereby finds that the City and surrounding areas will sustain
continued growth in the form of new residential subdivisions and developments,
and the residents of such subdivisions and developments will need additional
parks, recreational facilities and public open spaces. The acquisition and
development of parks, recreational facilities and public open spaces are
necessary to meet the needs created by the future residents of such
subdivisions and developments and should be provided in substantial part by
such future residents.
(Ord. 115-03. Passed 10-2-03.)
1230.02 PURPOSE.
   It is found that parks, recreational facilities and public open spaces are
necessary elements of public welfare. Therefore, the public health, safety and
welfare require that at least ten acres of property, and an amount of money
sufficient to develop such ten acres, for every 1,000 residents be supplied. It
is the purpose of this chapter to define the necessary authority to the
Planning Commission, Department of Public Service and Council in order to
attain this purpose.
(Ord. 115-03. Passed 10-2-03.)
1230.03 STATEMENT OF POLICY.
   With respect to subdivision and developments to which this chapter applies,
at least ten acres of property for each 1,000 persons should be devoted and/or
developed for parks, recreational facilities and public open space by or at the
expense of subdividers and developers of the dwellings in which such persons
shall reside.

(Ord. 115-03. Passed 10-2-03.)
1230.06 PROVISION FOR PARKS, RECREATIONAL FACILITIES, AND PUBLIC OPEN SPACE.
   (a)   (1)   Every subdivider, developer or builder who proposes any
development, subdivision, single-family dwelling unit or lot split 30 days
after the effective date of this chapter, or after the adoption of the Parks
and Recreation Plan, shall be required to:
         A.   Dedicate a portion of such land for recreational purposes; or

subdivision, development or lot split.
   (b)   (1)   The population factor for each dwelling shall be as follows:
 
Dwelling Type          Population Factor
Single-family dwelling 2.66
Multi-family           2.33
 
      (2)   The Planning Commission may modify the requirements of this section

         C.   The unique or special characteristics of the development which
justify modification of the requirements can be reasonably expected to continue
for the life of the project.
   (c)   The total population for any subdivision or development shall equal
the sum of the population factors of all dwellings to be included in the
subdivision or development.
(Ord. 115-03. Passed 10-2-03.)
1230.08 AMOUNT OF LAND TO BE DEDICATED.
   The amount of land to be dedicated by a subdivider, builder or developer
shall be determined in accordance with the following formula:
   Acres of land for dedication = total population X .01
(Ord. 115-03. Passed 10-2-03.)
1230.09 DETERMINATION OF FAIR MARKET VALUE.
   For the purposes of this chapter, fair market value shall be determined as
follows:
   (a)   Time. Fair market value shall be determined as of the time of filing
the final plat or final development plan with the Planning Commission. Fair
market value of the acreage of a single-family dwelling unit shall be
determined at the time a building permit is issued to the builder whose lots
are not under the jurisdiction of the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Method. Fair market value shall equal the average value per acre of
all residential land in the Park District encompassing the largest portion of
the subdivision or development in its raw, undeveloped state, determined by
application of one of the following procedures:
      (1)   By agreement between the subdivider or developer and the Planning
Commission; or
      (2)   In the event the subdivider or developer and the Planning
Commission cannot agree, by determination of the Planning Commission on the
basis of assessed value for property tax purposes of all land in the
subdivision or development, modified to equal market value in accordance with
current assessment practices and divided by the total number of acres within
the subdivision or development; or
      (3)   In the event the subdivider or developer objects to the valuation
method set forth in division (b)(2) of this section, then by a qualified
independent appraiser approved by the Planning Commission and the subdivider or
developer; or
      (4)   In the event the subdivider or developer objects to all of the
foregoing methods of valuation, then by a three-member Board of Appraisers, one
of who shall be appointed by the Planning Commission, one of whom shall be
appointed by the subdivider or developer, and one of whom shall be selected by
the two appraisers so appointed. The decision of a majority of such Board shall
be final.
(Ord. 115-03. Passed 10-2-03.)
1230.10 LAND ACQUISITION FEE IN LIEU OF DEDICATION.
   (a)   Amount. In the event the Planning Commission determines that a
subdivider or developer must pay a land acquisition fee in lieu of land
dedication, the amount of such land acquisition fee shall be determined by the
following formula:
   Land acquisition fee in lieu of land dedication =    Amount of land which
would                                     otherwise be required to be
                                        dedicated
                                                       X
   (b)   Total of Land and Payment. Excluding the park development land
acquisition fee, the total of land and payment made by a subdivider or
developer in land and land acquisition fee in lieu of dedication shall be no
greater than the fair market value of the amount of land required to be
dedicated pursuant to Section
1230.09.
   (c)   Developers, builders or subdividers that have single lots or minor lot
splits in the City, where utilities are in place, will pay a flat fee of five
hundred dollars ($500.00) for land acquisition cost.
(Ord. 115-03. Passed 10-2-03; Ord. 146-04. Passed 7-16-04.)
1230.11 CHOICE OF LAND.
   (a)   Procedure.
      (1)   At the time of the preliminary discussion, the developer or
subdivider should gain information concerning requirement of the Planning
Commission regarding dedication of land, impact fee in lieu payments, or both.
      (2)   If, at the time of the filing of the preliminary plan, the
developer or subdivider proposes to dedicate land for parks, recreation and
open spaces, such land proposed to be dedicated shall be indicated on the
preliminary plan.
      (3)   If, after the preliminary discussion, the developer proposes to pay
a impact fee in lieu, such information should be submitted as part of the
preliminary plan to the Planning Commission.
      (4)   As part of the action concerning the preliminary plan, the Planning
Commission shall review the proposal of the developer or subdivider concerning
either dedication of land, payment of an impact fee in lieu, or both. The
criteria used in reviewing the proposals of the preliminary plan to determine
whether the subdivider or developer shall dedicate land, pay an impact fee in
lieu or both, shall be as follows:
         A.   The Planning Commission decision shall attempt to facilitate the
objective outline in the London City Parks and Recreation Plan.
         B.   The Planning Commission shall also consider the advice of various
members of the City administration, the Director of Parks and Recreation and
the Parks and Recreation Commission.
         C.   The Planning Commission must also consider that Council will
review the proposal as part of the review of the preliminary plan.
         D.   If the subdivider or developer proposes to dedicate land, then
the following additional criteria shall be used to determine if such a proposal
is acceptable:
            1.   Minimum dedication. If the amount of land required to be
dedicated is less than five acres, and that area could not be added to an
adjoining, contiguous existing park or recreational area, no such dedication of
land shall be deemed acceptable by the Planning Commission. In this situation,
the requirements shall be fulfilled only by payment of an impact fee in lieu of
land dedication.
            2.   Unity. Dedicated land must form a single parcel, except in the
event that the Planning Commission determines that two or more parcels would be
in the best public interest.
            3.   Shape. The shape of the dedicated parcel shall be sufficiently
geometric to be usable for recreational activities such as softball, tennis,
football and other recreational activities.
            4.   Topography. Steep slopes, streams, lakes, watercourses, flood
plains may constitute a maximum of 30% of the dedicated land and a minimum of
70% of the land required for dedication shall be suitable for dry ground
recreational use.
            5.   Grade. Seventy percent of the land suitable for dry ground
recreation use shall not exceed 3% grade, and the remaining dry ground area
shall not exceed 5% grade.
            6.   Areas of unique natural beauty or having environmental or
historic value. If the Planning Commission determines that a proposed parcel of
dedicated land is of unique natural beauty or of environmental or historical
value, the requirements regarding shape, topography or grade may be waived.
            7.   Access. Public maintenance and emergency access shall be
provided by direct frontage of the dedicated land on a public street. Such
frontage shall be of sufficient width to allow for maintenance and emergency
vehicle access or, an easement of sufficient width to allow such access shall
be provided.
            8.   Preservation of natural beauty. Natural features of scenic
beauty which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the dedicated
land, shall be preserved in the dedication of open space and parks and
recreation areas.
   (b)   Determination by Planning Commission. On the basis of the review of
the proposal by the subdivider or developer, the Planning Commission shall
determine whether a dedication of land, a payment of tax in lieu or a
combination of both shall be made by the developer or subdivider.
   (c)   Reclamation.
      (1)   If the Planning Commission approves dedication of a parcel of land
and, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, that parcel will be adversely
affected by the operations of the developer or subdivider, the Planning
Commission may require that the subdivider or developer submit a plan, approved
by the City Engineer, for reclamation of such land to a state suitable for
recreational use.
      (2)   If such reclamation plan is acceptable, the subdivider or developer
shall implement and complete such plan within a reasonable time period as
prescribed by the Planning Commission.
      (3)   A performance bond of 100% of the estimated cost of such
reclamation shall be posted by the developer or subdivider.
(Ord. 115-03. Passed 10-2-03.)
1230.12 PARK IMPACT FEE.
   (a)   Amount of Development Impact Fee. In addition to all other
requirements, a subdivider, developer or builder shall be required to pay a
park development impact fee in an amount equal to the fair market value of the
land to be dedicated as described in Section
1230.10.
   (b)   Determination of Fair Market Value. Fair market value shall be
determined as described in Section
1230.09.
   (c)   Credit for Voluntary Dedication. If a subdivider or developer
dedicates land in addition to the amount required in Section
1230.10, the Planning Commission may grant credit to the developer or
subdivider against the amount of the park development fee. The credit granted
shall be no greater than one-half of the fair market value of the additional
land to be dedicated.
   (d)   Developers, builders or subdividers that have single lots or minor lot
splits, who have paid a flat fee as set forth in Section
1230.10(c), shall pay a flat fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for a Park
Impact Fee.
(Ord. 115-03. Passed 10-2-03; Ord. 146-04. passed 7-16-04.)
1230.13 CREDIT FOR PRIVATE OPEN SPACE.
   (a)   Allowance of Credit. In the event a subdivider or developer provides
private open space for park and recreation purposes and such space is to be
privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision or
development, or by the subdivider or developer, and in the event the Planning
Commission determines that such private open space adequately fulfills the park
and recreation needs of the proposed subdivision or development, the fair
market value of such areas shall be credited against the land dedication and
park development fee requirements of this chapter.
   (b)   Maximum Credit. Such credit however, shall be allowed only up to a
maximum of two-thirds of the total required land dedication or fee in lieu
requirements, and up to a maximum of two-thirds of the total required park
development fee.
   (c)   Standards and Limitations. Notwithstanding, divisions(a) and (b) of
this section, the credit for private open space shall be allowed only if the
following standards are met:
      (1)   Yards, court areas, setbacks and other such open areas required to
be maintained by the Zoning Code shall not be included in the computation of
such private open space;
      (2)   Private ownership, development and maintenance of the open space
shall be assured by valid and enforceable undertakings on the part of the
subdivider or developer or otherwise, a copy of such undertakings to be
submitted to the Planning Commission for review with the preliminary plat and a
copy approved by the Planning Commission to be filed with the final plat;
      (3)   The use of the private open space is restricted for park and
recreation purposes by recorded covenants that run with the land in favor of
the future owners of property within the subdivision or development and which
cannot, by their terms, be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the
Planning Commission;
      (4)   The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for park
and recreational uses, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape,
topography, geology, access and location of the private open space land; and
      (5)   Facilities proposed for the private open space are reasonably
compatible with those required by the London City Parks and Recreation Plan.
(Ord. 115-03. Passed 10-2-03.)
1230.14 TREATMENT OF LAND TO BE DEDICATED; PROCEDURES FOR THE DEDICATION OF
LAND AND PAYMENT OF THE LAND ACQUISITION FEE.
   (a)   Following approval of a preliminary plat map or development plan which
designates land for dedication, the existing vegetation, except growing
commercial crops other than growing timber, topography, features of historic
value, stream courses, soil, rock strata and other natural features of such
dedicated land shall not be altered or their condition adversely affected in
any way without the consent of the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Dedication of land to the City shall be by a general warranty deed
conveying to the City, and its successors and assigns, good and marketable
title to the real estate described in such deed. The land shall be free and
clear of all taxes, liens, assessments or encumbrances due and payable as well
as all taxes, liens, assessments or encumbrances due but not yet payable. This
deed shall be executed and delivered to the City for recording prior to the
approval of the final plat map or development plan of any section or any
portion of the subdivision or development, the boundary of which is contiguous
with the proposed parks, recreational facilities and public open space. Open
space covenants for private parks, recreational facilities and public open
space shall be submitted to the City prior to approval of the final plat map or
development plan of any section or portion of the subdivision or development,
the boundary of which is contiguous with the proposed parks, recreational
facilities and public open space. Open space covenants for private parks,
recreational facilities and public open space shall be submitted to the City
prior to approval of the final plat map or development plan and shall be
recorded contemporaneously with the final plat map or development plan. In the
event the land acquisition fee, including the park impact fee are required, one
of the following methods of payment may be imposed:
      (1)   Ten percent of the amount thereof shall be deposited with the City
prior to the approval and recording of the final plat map or development plan,
and the balance shall be due and payable one year from such date or at the time
the first occupancy permit is issued with respect to such subdivision or
development, whichever may occur first.
      (2)   One hundred percent of the per-dwelling unit impact fee is to be
paid at the time of the issuance of the building permit for each dwelling unit.
In no event shall any occupancy permit be granted with respect to such
subdivision development or lot split until all such impact fees are deposited
with the City.
(Ord. 115-03. Passed 10-2-03.)
1230.15 LIMITATION ON USE OF LAND AND FEES.
   (a)   Any land acquisition fee or impact fees which are received by the City
pursuant to this chapter shall be used only for the purpose of providing parks,
recreational facilities, and public open spaces. Fees paid pursuant to this
chapter shall be deposited in a Parks and Recreational Capital Improvement Fund
to be used for requisition, development and improvement of such lands. No part
of such land acquisition fees or impact fees shall be used for operation or
maintenance of such lands.
   (b)   Land acquisition fees and impact fees received may be only expended in
connection with the acquisition or development of parks, recreational
facilities or public open space within the reasonable proximity of the
development or subdivision which was the source of the payment of the land
acquisition fee.
   (c)   During the period of time that the land acquisition fee and impact fee
levied by this section is collected, the legislature of the City shall
appropriate annually from other municipal tax sources, a sum of money which
shall be prorated among the parks located within the City.
   (d)   Reasonable proximity shall mean that the recreational facility, park
or public open space and the subdivision or development concerned are in the
same recreational district as described in the London City Park and Recreation
Plan.
(Ord. 115-03. Passed 10-2-03.)
1230.16 ADJUSTMENT PROVISION.
   Notwithstanding, any provision of this chapter to the contrary, the Planning
Commission may, in cases of an unusual or exceptional nature, allow for
adjustments in the park land dedication and land acquisition fee regulations
and park development fee requirements as established in and required by the
provisions of this chapter. Adjustments may be allowed when, in the opinion of
the Planning Commission, it has been determined and satisfactorily shown that
the character of the particular subdivision or development and the park and
recreation needs generated by and associated with any subdivision or
development sufficiently justify such an adjustment or adjustments. However, no
adjustment from the strict application of any provision of this chapter shall
be granted by the Planning Commission unless it finds, beyond a reasonable
doubt, that all the following facts and conditions exist:
   (a)   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land involved, and which are not applicable to other lands in the immediate
vicinity.
   (b)   That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant.
   (c)   That gaining the variance requested will provide the minimum necessary
relief to alleviate the hardship and will not confer on the applicant any
special privilege which is denied by this chapter to the other lands,
structures or buildings in the same vicinity.
   (d)   That granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the
neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
(Ord. 115-03. Passed 10-2-03.)
1230.17 VALIDITY AND SEPARABILITY.
   It is hereby declared to be the legislative intent that, if any provision or
provisions of this chapter or the application thereof to any lot or tract of
land are declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
ineffective in whole or in part, or to be inapplicable to any person or
situation, all other provisions of this chapter shall continue to be separate
and fully effective and the application of any such provision to other persons
or situations shall not be affected.
(Ord. 115-03. Passed 10-2-03.)
1230.18 REPEAL OF CONFLICTING ORDINANCES.

1242.06 CITIZENS ADVISORY COMMITTEES FOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   Composition; Term of Office. There are hereby established one or more
Citizen Advisory Committees for Industrial Development. Each Committee shall
consist of five members. One member shall be appointed by the Mayor, one by the
President of Council, one by the Councilmember in whose ward the project will
be located, and two additional members by the three appointees. Members shall
be selected on the basis of their having personal residences and/or businesses
located within one-half mile of any proposed industrial development, including
an expansion of existing industry. Such members' residences or businesses shall
not necessarily be located in the City. Persons from contiguous townships
within one-half mile of any proposed development shall be eligible for
membership on such a Committee.
The term of office for each member shall be one year.
   (b)   Organization; Procedure. Each Committee shall be organized on an ad
hoc basis for rendering advisory opinions on industrial development in the
committee's geographic area. Each Committee shall select its Chairperson, adopt
its own rules of procedure and proceed with its investigation in whatever
manner it deems proper.
   (c)   General Powers. The function of each Committee shall be to review
applications submitted to the Zoning Administrator with regard to any use on M-
1 District lands or in a PUD District with M-1 District-type land uses, which
fall within the geographic area of the Committee. The Committee shall conduct
such investigations as it deems necessary to determine whether or not the
proposed industrial project meets with the transportation, air quality, sewage,
water and/or storm water capabilities; whether or not it generates excessive
noise, heat, light and/or glare; and whether or not the nature of the proposed
usage is, on balance, detrimental to the residents of such area. After making
such determinations, the Committee shall submit a report and a recommendation
to the Commission and/or the Board, which the Commission and/or Board may
consider together with other evidence.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1242.07 DUTIES OF THE ZONING ADMINISTRATOR, BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS, COUNCIL
AND COURTS RE APPEALS.
   It is the intent of this Zoning Code that all questions of interpretation
and enforcement shall be presented first to the Zoning Administrator, that such
questions shall be presented to the Board of Zoning Appeals only on appeal from
the decision of the Zoning Administrator and that recourse from the decisions
of the Board shall be to the courts, as provided by law.
   It is also the intent of this Zoning Code that the duties of Council, in
connection with this Zoning Code, shall not include hearing and deciding
questions of interpretation and enforcement that may arise. The procedure for
deciding such questions shall be as stated in this Zoning Code.
   Under this Zoning Code, Council shall have the authority only to establish
and amend a schedule of fees, as set forth in Section
1242.08.
   Nothing in this Zoning Code shall be interpreted to prevent any official of
the City from appealing a decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals to the
courts, as provided in the Ohio Revised Code. Any such appeal shall be made
within ten days of the Board's written decision.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)

1242.09 ZONING PERMITS.
   (a)   Required. No structure shall be erected, added to, structurally
altered and/or moved to a lot in the City without a permit issued by the Zoning
Administrator. Zoning permits shall be issued only in conformity with the
provisions of this Zoning Code, including actions resulting from a written
order from:
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals, such as deciding an appeal, a

      (2)   Council, such as approving a planned unit development district, a
special use or annexation zoning.
   (b)   Applications. The application for a zoning permit shall be made in
writing and shall be signed and dated by the applicant, attesting to the truth
and exactness of all information supplied on the application. Each application
form shall state clearly that the permit, if issued, shall expire (and may be
revoked) if work has not begun within one year of the permit issuance, if the
work is not substantially completed within two and one-half years or if the
facts have been misrepresented in an important way. At a minimum, the

accompanied by all required fees:
      (1)   The name, address and telephone number of the applicant;
      (2)   A legal description of the property and any easements plus the text

location map and a larger scale map showing the actual dimensions and the shape
of the lot; the exact size and location of existing structures on the lot, if
any; and the location and dimensions of the proposed structure or alteration;
      (7)   Structure heights;

certificates, such as a sign, conditional use and/or temporary use permit,
unless previously submitted;
      (12)   Such other documentation as may be necessary to determine
conformance with, and to provide for the enforcement of, this Zoning Code, such
as the physical condition of property after a structure is moved to or from the
lot; and
      (13)   The date the Zoning Administrator received the fee and completed
the application.
   (c)   Approval. Within thirty days after the receipt of an application, the
Zoning Administrator shall either approve or disapprove the application in
conformance with the provisions of this Zoning Code. After the Zoning
Administrator shall have marked one copy of the application and any plans
either as approved or disapproved, and attested to that decision by his or her
signature and the date of his or her decision on such copy, one copy of such
signed application and any plans shall be returned to the applicant by the
Zoning Administrator. One copy, similarly marked, shall be retained by the
Zoning Administrator. If approved, the Zoning Administrator shall issue a
zoning permit that shall be posted by the applicant in a conspicuous place on
the property in question, attesting to the fact that the activity is in
conformance with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (d)   Notice to Ohio Director of Transportation. Before any zoning permit is
issued for any lot that is located within 300 feet of the centerline of a
proposed new highway or of a highway for which changes are proposed (as
described in the certification to local officials by the Ohio Director of
Transportation), or for any lot that is located within a radius of 500 feet
from the point of intersection of such centerline with any public road or
highway, the Zoning Administrator shall give notice to the Ohio Director of
Transportation, by registered mail, that the Zoning Administrator shall not
issue a zoning permit for 120 days from the date such notice is received by the
Director. If the Director notifies the Zoning Administrator that the Director
shall proceed to acquire the land needed, the Zoning Administrator shall refuse
to issue the zoning permit. If the Director notifies the Zoning Administrator
that acquisition at this time is not in the public interest, or if the 120-day
period (or any extension of the 120-day period that was agreed upon by the
Director and the property owner) expires without notification from the
Director, the Zoning Administrator shall issue the zoning permit, if the
application is in conformance with all provisions of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
   (e)   Expiration. If the work described in any zoning permit has not begun
within two years from the date of issuance of the permit, the permit shall
expire. Upon expiration, the Zoning Administrator shall revoke the permit and
shall send, by first class mail, written notice of the revocation to the permit
applicant. In addition, if the work described in any zoning permit has not been
substantially completed within three and one-half years from the date of
issuance of the permit, the permit shall expire. Upon expiration, the Zoning
Administrator shall revoke the permit and shall send, by first class mail,
written notice of the revocation to the permit applicant, together with notice
that further work shall not proceed unless and until a new zoning permit has
been obtained or until an extension has been granted.
(Ord. 123-94. Passed 4-21-94.)
1242.10 CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY.
   (a)   Required. After the adoption of this Zoning Code, it shall be unlawful
to use or occupy any new or changed lot and/or structure, or to change the use
of any existing lot and/or structure, until the Zoning Administrator issues a
certificate of occupancy that states that the proposed use of the structure
and/or land conforms to the requirements of this Zoning Code. The issuance of
an occupancy certificate in no way relieves the recipient from compliance with
all requirements of this Zoning Code and other applicable regulations.
   (b)   Temporary Certificates of Occupancy. A temporary certificate of
occupancy may be issued by the Zoning Administrator (for a period not exceeding
six months) allowing alterations to be made to, or allowing partial occupancy
of, a building pending its completion.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1242.11 RECORDS OF PERMITS AND/OR CERTIFICATES; COPIES.
   The Zoning Administrator shall maintain a record of all permits and
certificates required by this Zoning Code, and copies shall be furnished, upon
request and upon payment of the established fee, to any person.

1242.12 FAILURE TO OBTAIN PERMITS AND/OR CERTIFICATES.
   Failure to obtain a permit and/or certificate required by this Zoning Code
shall be a violation of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1242.13 CONSTRUCTION AND USE TO BE AS PROVIDED IN APPLICATIONS, PLANS, PERMITS
AND/OR CERTIFICATES; VIOLATIONS.
   Permits and/or certificates are issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Zoning Administrator and authorize only the use
and arrangement that are set forth in such approved plans and applications
(including their amendments). Any other use, arrangement and/or construction is
prohibited and may be deemed a violation of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1242.14 COMPLAINTS REGARDING VIOLATIONS.
   Whenever a violation of this Zoning Code occurs or is alleged to have
occurred, any person may file a written complaint. Such complaint shall state
fully the causes and basis of the complaint and shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall record properly such complaint,
immediately investigate it and take prompt action on it, as provided by this
Zoning Code.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1242.15 RIGHT OF ENTRY; INSPECTIONS.
   The Zoning Administrator is authorized to make inspections of properties and
structures at any reasonable hour in order to examine and survey them for the
purpose of enforcing the provisions of this Zoning Code, except that prior to
seeking entry to any property or structure for such examination or survey, the
Zoning Administrator shall attempt to obtain the permission of the owner or
occupant to inspect the premises. If such permission is denied or cannot be
obtained, the Zoning Administrator shall request the assistance of the Law
Director in securing a valid search warrant prior to entry.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1242.16 STOP WORK ORDERS; VIOLATIONS.
   Subsequent to his or her determination that work is being done contrary to
this Zoning Code, the Zoning Administrator shall write a stop work order and
post it on the premises involved. Removal of a stop work order, except by the
order of the courts or the Zoning Administrator, shall constitute a violation
of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1242.17 PERMIT REVOCATIONS; APPEALS.
   The Zoning Administrator shall issue a revocation notice to revoke a permit
(or to revoke an administrative approval) that was issued contrary to this
Zoning Code or that was issued based upon false information, misrepresentation
in the application or other wrongful basis (as stated in the revocation
notice). Such a revocation notice may be appealed to the Board.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1242.18 NOTICE OF VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   Whenever the Zoning Administrator (or his or her agent) determines
that there is a violation of any provision of this Zoning Code, a dated warning
tag shall be issued and shall serve as a notice of violation. Such notice
shall:
      (1)   Be in writing;
      (2)   Identify the violation;
      (3)   Include a statement of the reason why it is being issued and refer
to the sections of this Zoning Code being violated; and

notice with a person of suitable age and discretion at the usual place of
residence of the person responsible; or
      (2)   Posting a copy of the notice of violation form in a conspicuous
place on the premises found in violation.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1242.19 CITATIONS.
   If, upon re-inspection after a reasonable period of time following the
issuance of a notice of violation, the condition has not been corrected, the
person responsible shall be issued a citation by the Zoning Administrator. Such
citation shall:
   (a)   Be served as provided by Rule 4 of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure;
   (b)   Identify the violation;
   (c)   State the time, date and place for appearance in court; and

or any amendment thereto.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1242.99 PENALTY; EQUITABLE REMEDIES.
   (a)   Whoever violates any provision of this Zoning Code, or fails to comply
with any of its requirements, is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be
fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each offense, and, in
addition, shall pay all court and City costs and expenses involved in the case.
If there are two or more violations, each violation shall be considered to be a
separate offense. Each week and/or part of a week that a violation occurs or
continues after receipt of a violation notice shall be considered a separate
offense. The owner or tenant of any structure and/or lot (or part of a
structure and/or lot), and any architect, builder, contractor, agent or other
person who commits, participates in, assists in or maintains such violation,
may each be found guilty of a separate offense and may be subject to the
penalties provided in this section.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
   (b)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of
Chapter 1264, including violations of and noncompliance with conditions and
safeguards established in connection with conditions, is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree and shall be fined not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00) or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both, for
each offense. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or
on which a violation or noncompliance occurs or continues.

action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation of
Chapter 1264.
(Ord. 147-93. Passed 5-6-93.)
   (c)   Nothing in this Zoning Code shall be deemed to abolish, impair or
prevent other additional remedies, as provided by law. In the event of a
violation (or imminent threat of such violation) of any provision or
requirement of this Zoning Code, the Zoning Administrator, the Law Director
and/or the owner of any neighboring property who would be especially damaged by
such violation, may, in addition to other recourses provided by law, institute
mandamus, injunction, abatement or other appropriate actions to prevent,
remove, abate, enjoin or terminate such violation.
   (d)   The remedies provided in this Zoning Code shall be cumulative, not
exclusive, and shall be in addition to any other remedies provided by law.

1244.01 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED; APPELLATE JURISDICTION OF BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   Appeals and variances, whether heard by the Board of Zoning Appeals or the

(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92; Ord. 170-11. Passed 10-6-11.)
1244.02 APPEALS OF DECISIONS OF THE ZONING ADMINISTRATOR; NOTICE TO APPEAL.
   Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals concerning the interpretation or
administration of this Zoning Code may be taken by any person aggrieved, or by
any officer or bureau of the legislative authority of the City, including
Council or the Planning Commission, affected by any decision of the Zoning
Administrator. Such an appeal shall be taken within twenty days after the
decision of the Zoning Administrator by filing (with the Zoning Administrator
and with the Board of Zoning Appeals) a notice to appeal that specifies the
grounds upon which the appeal is being taken. The Zoning Administrator shall
transmit to the Board of Zoning Appeals all the papers constituting the record
upon which the action appealed from was taken.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1244.03 STAY OF PROCEEDINGS AFTER FILING OF NOTICE TO APPEAL.
   A notice to appeal that is filed with the Zoning Administrator stays all
proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning
Administrator certifies to the Board of Zoning Appeals that, by reason of the
facts stated in the application, a stay would (in his or her opinion) cause
imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be
stayed (other than by a restraining order that may be granted by the Board of
Zoning Appeals or by a court of record on application) on notice to the Zoning
Administrator from whom the appeal is taken on due cause shown.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1244.04 VARIANCES.
   (a)   Authorization Upon Application or Appeal.
      (1)   Use variances. Upon appeal for specific cases, the Board of Zoning
Appeals, or the Planning Commission in Planned Unit Development districts, may
authorize a use variance from the terms of this Zoning Code as will not be
contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Code would result in unnecessary
hardship. A use variance is defined as a variance that authorizes uses not
expressly or impliedly permitted by the Zoning Code.
      (2)   Area variances. The Board of Zoning Appeals, or the Planning
Commission in Planned Unit Development districts, may authorize an area
variance from the terms of this Zoning Code as will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this Zoning Code would result in practical difficulties.
      (3)   No nonconforming use of neighboring lands and/or structures in the
same district, and no permitted or nonconforming use of lands and/or structures
in other districts, shall be considered grounds for issuance of a variance.
Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of convenience or profit, but
only in accordance with the applicable standard set forth in this section.
   (b)   Application and Standards. Except as otherwise permitted in this
Zoning Code, no variance from the strict application of the provisions of this
Zoning Code shall be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals unless the Board or
Commission shall find that the written application for the requested variance
contains all of the following requirements:
      (1)   The name, address and telephone number of the applicant;
      (2)   A legal description of the property;
      (3)   A description of the nature of the variance requested;
      (4)   A fee, as provided in or pursuant to this Zoning Code; and
      (5)   Narrative statements establishing and substantiating that the
requested variance conforms to the following standards:
         A.   The granting of the variance shall be in accordance with the
general purpose and intent of the regulations imposed by this Zoning Code for
the district in which it is located and shall not be injurious to the area or
otherwise detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare.
         B.   The granting of the variance will not permit the establishment of
any use that is not otherwise permitted in the district.
         C.   A description shall be given of the special circumstances or
conditions applicable to the lot and/or structure for which the variance is
sought, which are peculiar to such lot and/or structure and do not apply
generally to a lot and/or structure in the area, and which are such that the
strict application of the provisions of this Zoning Code would deprive the
applicant of the reasonable use of such lot and/or structure. Mere loss in
value shall not justify a variance; there must be deprivation of reasonable use
of land.
         D.   In the case of a use variance, there must be proof of unnecessary
hardship created by the strict application of this Zoning Code. It is not
sufficient proof of hardship to show that greater profit would result if the
use variance were granted. Furthermore, the hardship complained of cannot be
self-created, nor can it be established that a hardship exists because the lot
and/or structure was purchased with or without knowledge of the restrictions
contained in this Zoning Code. The hardship must result from the application of
this Zoning Code, it must be suffered directly by the property in question, and
evidence of use variances granted under similar circumstances need not be
considered.
         E.   In the case of an area variance, there must be proof of practical
difficulties created by the strict application of this Zoning Code. The factors
to be weighed include, but are not limited to:
            1.   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable
return or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance;
            2.   Whether the variance is substantial;
            3.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
            4.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (e.g., water, sewer, garbage);
            5.   Whether the property owner purchased the property with
knowledge of the zoning restriction;
            6.   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be
obviated through some method other than a variance;
            7.   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement
would be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
         F.   The granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use
of the land and/or structure that will accomplish this purpose.
         G.   The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion in the
public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety or
substantially diminish or impair property values of the adjacent area.
         H.   The granting of the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied, because of the provisions of
this Zoning Code, to other lots and/or structures in the same district.
      (6)   A list of owners of property and their mailing addresses whose
property has any lot line located immediately adjacent to or across the street
from any property line of the subject property, and any other persons, as
determined by the Zoning Administrator, who may have substantial interest in
the case.
   (c)   Additional Conditions and Safeguards; Violations. The Board or
Commission may further prescribe any conditions and safeguards that it deems
necessary to ensure that the objectives of the regulations or provisions to
which the variance applies will be met. Any violation of such conditions and
safeguards, when they have been made a part of the terms under which the
variance has been granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning Code.

1244.05 PUBLIC HEARINGS BY BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS; NOTICES.

12-18-03; Ord. 161-05. Passed 11-3-05)
1248.03 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   (a)   In General; Incorporation by Reference. The districts established in
Section
1248.02 are shown on the Official Zoning Map. The Official Zoning Map, and all
data, references, explanatory material and notations on such Official Zoning
Map, are hereby incorporated by reference in this Zoning Code, thereby having
the same force and effect as if fully described in writing in this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Legend. The Official Zoning Map shall contain a legend that shall list
the name and symbol (which may be any color and/or pattern) of each zoning
district. In addition to such legend, the Official Zoning Map shall provide
sufficient space for noting Official Zoning Map amendments, in compliance with
Section
1248.06.
   (c)   Identification; Maintenance; Conflicts. The Official Zoning Map shall
be properly identified by the signature of the Mayor, as attested by the
Safety-Service Director, and shall bear the official seal of the City. The
Official Zoning Map shall be maintained by the Zoning Administrator and shall
remain on file in the office of the Safety-Service Director.
   Whenever there is an apparent conflict between the district boundaries (as
shown on the Official Zoning Map) and the descriptions (as found in the text of
this Zoning Code or any other ordinance), the written descriptions shall
control.
   The Official Zoning Map shall be a reproducible document, and copies shall
be made available to the public upon request and upon payment of a fee, as
established by Council. Whenever the Official Zoning Map is changed by Council,
the Mayor and the Safety-Service Director shall certify the accuracy of the
Official Zoning Map by placing their signatures and the date on the
reproducible Official Zoning Map.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1248.04 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   When a district boundary is not specifically indicated on the Official
Zoning Map, the zoning district boundary shall be the item indicated below that
is closest to and most parallel to the Official Zoning Map boundary. Where two
or more items listed below are equidistant from, and equally parallel to, the
Official Zoning Map boundary, the item listed first below shall control:
   (a)   The centerline of a thoroughfare, highway, street or other road
surface.
   (b)   The centerline of a thoroughfare, highway, street or other road right
of way.
   (c)   A lot line.
   (d)   The corporate limits of the City.
   (e)   The Township line of an Ohio unit of government.
   (f)   A Virginia Military Survey line.
   (g)   A township or range line.
   (h)   The centerline of a railroad line.
   (i)   The centerline of a railroad right of way.
   (j)   The centerline of a river, stream or other waterway.
   (k)   The centerline of a lake, pond or other body of water.
   Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by official
Council action, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street, alley
or public way shall automatically be extended to the center of such vacation,
and all areas within that vacation shall, thereafter, be subject to all
regulations appropriate to the respective extended districts.
   In the event of a partial vacation, the zoning district adjoining such
partial vacation, or the district nearest the portion vacated, shall
automatically be extended to include all areas within that vacation, and all
such areas shall, thereafter, be subject to all regulations appropriate to the
extended district.
   All questions and disputes concerning the exact location of zoning district
boundaries shall be resolved by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1248.05 ZONING OF ANNEXED TERRITORIES.
   Upon receipt of a petition for annexation, Council shall transmit a copy of
the petition to the Planning Commission for its zoning classification
recommendation. The Planning Commission shall determine the zoning
classification of the property at its first regularly scheduled meeting
following receipt of the petition from Council. Upon completion of this
meeting, the Planning Commission shall transmit its zoning recommendation to
Council. After the Planning Commission recommendation has been received by
Council, the normal amendment procedures provided in
Chapter 1246 shall be followed. If the recommendation has to be submitted to
the Ohio Director of Transportation (as required by Section
1246.06), and if the Director has not responded by the effective date of the
annexation, an interim zoning shall be established that is effective only until
Council acts following the receipt of the Director's response, as follows:
   (a)   If an annexed lot is not zoned at the time of its annexation to the
City, it shall be classified temporarily as an R-1 Low-Density Residential
District.
   (b)   An annexed lot that is zoned at the time of its annexation to the City
shall remain temporarily in that district and under the zoning regulations and
control of the appropriate township or County officials.
   In either case, any such interim zoning of annexed land shall not be added
to the Official Zoning Map but shall be entered in the records of the Zoning
Administrator.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92; Ord. 210-13. Passed 12-19-13.)
1248.06 AMENDMENTS TO THE OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   Within fifteen days of the effective date of any change of a zoning district
classification or boundary, the Zoning Administrator shall amend the
reproducible copy of the Official Zoning Map to reflect such change and shall
note on the Official Zoning Map the effective date of such change and the
ordinance number authorizing such change. The amendment notation to the
Official Zoning Map shall be signed by the Mayor and attested to by the Safety-
Service Director.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1248.07 OFFICIAL SCHEDULE OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS.

operation and/or maintenance of such utilities and/or change the normal
direction of flow of drainage channels within the easement.
   The easement area of each lot, and any improvements within such easement,
shall be maintained continuously by the owner of the lot, except for those
improvements for which a public authority or a utility is responsible.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1250.05 REFUSE COLLECTION AREAS.
   All multifamily residential, business and/or manufacturing district uses
(except home occupations of an office-type business nature and single-family

trash, garbage and other discarded materials. This area shall be either
completely enclosed or enclosed on at least three of the four sides by a wall
or fence that is at least four feet high.
   Provisions, as determined necessary by the Zoning Administrator, shall be
made for regular and adequate vehicular access for collection purposes to any
refuse collection area.
   In addition, the following requirements shall apply to all uses in all

front yard in that district, and each such yard shall be considered to be a
front yard.
   The largest remaining yard (in area) shall be considered to be a rear yard.
The smallest remaining yard shall be the side yard and shall need to be only as
wide as the "One Side Yard" requirement provided in Part 2, Lot, Yard, Height
and Floor Area Limitations, of the Official Schedule of District Regulations
provided in Section
1248.07.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1250.08 YARD REQUIREMENTS FOR MULTIFAMILY DWELLINGS.
   Two or more multifamily buildings on a single lot shall be considered as one
building for the purpose of determining front, side and rear yard requirements.
The entire group (as a unit) shall have one front and one rear yard, and two
side yards, as specified for dwellings in the district. Also, each individual
building within the group shall meet all yard requirements for the district, as
though each building were on an individual lot.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1250.09 EXCEPTIONS TO HEIGHT REGULATIONS.
   The height limitations provided in Part 2, Lot, Yard, Height and Floor Area
Limitations, of the Official Schedule of District Regulations, as provided in
Section
1248.07, do not apply to appurtenances and projections (such as spires,
belfries, cupolas, antennas, water tanks, ventilators or chimneys) that are
required to be placed above the roof level and are not intended for human
occupancy. Where the height of structures would constitute a hazard to the safe
landing and take-off of aircraft at an established airport, such structures
shall be limited to a safe height.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1250.10 ARCHITECTURAL PROJECTIONS.

corner along each lot line, and extend diagonally from the 25-foot point on one
lot line to the 25-foot point on the other, except that this provision is not
applicable at intersections within the B-3 District controlled by traffic
lights or four-way stop signs.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92; Ord. 149-04. Passed 7-15-04.)
1250.12 OBJECTIONABLE, NOXIOUS AND/OR DANGEROUS USES, PRACTICES AND/OR
CONDITIONS.
   No land and/or structure shall be used in any manner that creates and/or
contributes to the existence of conditions that are dangerous, injurious,
harmful, noxious and/or objectionable and/or that might adversely affect
surrounding areas or adjoining premises, except that any use permitted by this
Zoning Code may be undertaken or maintained if, prior to undertaking or
maintaining such use, acceptable measures and safeguards are implemented to
reduce such conditions to acceptable limits, as established in this section.
Specifically, the use of any land and/or structure in any district shall be in
violation of this Zoning Code if one or more of the following conditions are
found to exist at any time:
   (a)   The use and/or storage of flammable and/or explosive materials is not
adequately protected by fire-resistant, fire-fighting and fire-protection
equipment, or by such safety devices as are required for such activities;
   (b)   Activities involving the use and/or storage of flammable and/or
explosive materials are not separated or distanced from adjacent facilities or
activities to a distance compatible with the potential danger involved;
   (c)   Radioactivity, air pollution, hazardous wastes, water pollution and/or
contamination are present in violation of the regulations of the USEPA and/or
the OEPA (or their successors), or are found beyond any lot line of the use
generating such environmental impacts;
   (d)   Objectionable noise is present due to volume (exceeding sixty-five
decibels), frequency or beat, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
   (e)   Vibration (discernible by the Zoning Administrator without
instruments) is present on an adjoining lot;
   (f)   Direct or reflected glare is present that is visible from any street
in any district or from property not within a Manufacturing District; and/or
   (g)   Erosion is carrying objectionable substances onto any adjacent lot.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1250.13 ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS AND PLANS FOR DANGEROUS PROCESSES AND OPERATIONS
OF CERTAIN USES.
   Prior to the issuance of a zoning permit, the Zoning Administrator shall
require the submission of written assurances and plans indicating the manner in
which dangerous and objectionable aspects and/or elements of processes and/or
operations entailed in certain uses and/or occupations are to be eliminated or
reduced to acceptable limits and tolerances.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1250.14 TEMPORARY USES.
   (a)   The following regulations are necessary to govern certain uses that
are of a nonpermanent nature:
      (1)   At least seven days before the proposed beginning of a temporary
use, an application for a temporary zoning permit shall be made to the Zoning
Administrator and a fee, as established by Council, shall be paid.
      (2)   The application shall contain a description of the proposed use and
a site plan that includes sufficient information to determine the yard,
setback, parking and sanitary facility requirements for the proposed temporary
use. A valid temporary zoning permit is required prior to such use.
      (3)   The application for the temporary zoning permit shall be
accompanied by written permission of the property owner, and the permit shall
be prominently displayed at the site. If the proposed use will encroach upon
more than twenty-five percent of the nontemporary use's required parking area,
the Zoning Administrator shall not issue a temporary zoning permit. The Zoning
Administrator shall revoke the temporary zoning permit if he or she determines
that the temporary use has encroached upon more than twenty-five percent of the
nontemporary use's required parking area.
   (b)   The following uses are deemed to be temporary uses and shall be
subject to the provisions of subsection (a) hereof and the specified
regulations and time limits that follow, as well as the regulations of any
district in which such uses are located:
      (1)   Subdivision sales offices. Subdivision sales offices shall not
contain any living accommodations and shall be permitted on a lot in a
subdivision for a period of one year, except that up to two six-month
extensions may be granted, if conditions warrant. Such offices shall be removed
within two weeks of the sale of the last lot or upon the expiration of the
zoning permit, whichever occurs first. Removing the sales office includes
reconverting a model home to residential use, as long as there is no more
subdivision sales activity within the structure.
      (2)   Temporary buildings and/or offices. Temporary buildings and/or
offices without living accommodations, and equipment and/or storage facilities
that are used in conjunction with construction activity, shall be permitted
upon the lot being built upon for a period of one year, except that up to two
six-month extensions may be granted if construction is substantially under way.
Such uses shall be removed within two weeks of the completion of the
construction or upon expiration of the zoning permit, whichever occurs first.
      (3)   Temporary sales and services. Temporary sales and services may be
permitted on off-street parking areas within any Central Business District
Commercial District or General Highway Commercial District. The permit for
temporary sales is valid for up to three consecutive days. Within any twelve-
month period, no person shall receive more than four such permits and, within
any twelve-month period, no more than four such permits shall be issued for any
one lot.
         The applicant shall submit a current vendor's license or transient
vendor's license, a copy of which shall be kept by the Zoning Administrator.
This subsection shall not be interpreted to prohibit any such use in any case
where a valid covenant or deed restriction specifically authorizes such use, or
vice versa.
      (4)   Garage sales. Garage sales (including yard sales, porch sales and/
or barn sales) may be permitted within any district in which dwellings are
permitted and at any nonconforming residence. Any person, family or group may
conduct up to two such sales within any twelve-month period, but only upon the
resident's property. As long as the provisions of this Zoning Code are
observed, especially those pertaining to signs and parking, such sales that do
not exceed two consecutive days do not require a zoning permit. Garage sales
that are to last three or four consecutive days require a temporary zoning
permit. Garage sales that are to last more than four consecutive days are not
permitted.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1250.15 SCREENING AND BUFFERING.
   (a)   In addition to the setback and yard requirements of this Zoning Code,
screening or buffering (as described below) shall be provided for the lot of
any nonresidential use that abuts any Residential District. The screening plan
shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator for modification and/or
approval.
   (b)   The following provisions shall apply with respect to screening:
      (1)   Screening shall be provided for one or more of the following
purposes, as determined by the Zoning Administrator:
         A.   A visual barrier to partially or completely obstruct the view of
structures and/or activities.
         B.   An acoustic screen to aid in absorbing and/or deflecting noise.
         C.   A physical barrier to contain debris and/or litter.
      (2)   Screening shall consist of one or more of the following, as
determined by the Zoning Administrator:
         A.   A solid masonry wall.
         B.   A solid wood fence.

         E.   A landscaped mounding.
      (3)   The nature of the screening shall be in accordance with the
following:
         A.   There shall be no screening higher than thirty inches in a
required front yard.
         B.   Man-made screens shall be between seven and eight feet high.
         C.   Vegetative plantings shall be at least five feet high at
planting, not less than seven feet high within two years and maintained.
      (4)   Screening for purposes of absorbing and/or deflecting noise shall
be between seven and eight feet high and shall have a depth of at least ten
feet (if dense vegetation), or be a combination of a solid wall (masonry or
preservative-treated wood) and decorative plantings. The height shall be
adequate to absorb and/or deflect noise in relation to the nature of the use,
as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
      (5)   Whenever required screening is adjacent to parking areas or
driveways, such screening shall be protected by bumper blocks, posts and/or
curbing to avoid damage to the screening by vehicles.
      (6)   All screening shall be trimmed, maintained in good condition and
free of advertising or other signs, except for directional signs and other
signs necessary for the efficient flow of vehicles.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1250.16 DETERMINATION OF REAR LOT LINES FOR DOUBLE FRONTAGE LOTS.
   In the absence of a rear lot line, as defined by this Zoning Code, it is
necessary to establish a pseudo-rear lot line to ensure the consistent
placement of accessory structures in relation to lots that have a rear lot
line. This pseudo-rear lot line shall be established by one of the following
methods of determination, listed in the order of preference or precedence:
   (a)   The middle of a utility or other easement that splits the lot into two
approximately equal parts.
   (b)   The rear lot line (extended) of an adjoining lot.
   (c)   The line connecting the rear lot lines of two adjoining lots.
   (d)   The middle of the distance between the two front yard setback lines.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1250.17 MINIMUM ACREAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR OFFICIAL ZONING MAP CHANGES.
   The minimum size requirements of this section are for the guidance of the
Planning Commission in its consideration of the establishment of new zoning
districts or of applications for rezoning.

(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1250.18 SHARING YARDS, OTHER OPEN SPACES OR OFF-STREET PARKING OR LOADING
SPACES.
   No part of a yard, other open space or off-street parking or loading space
about any structure, required for the purpose of complying with the regulations
of this Zoning Code, shall be included as a part of a yard, open space, off-
street parking space or loading space similarly required for another structure.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1250.19 DEVELOPERS WHO ARE NOT SUBDIVIDERS; DRAINAGE PLANS REQUIRED.
   (a)   All developers in nonresidential and multifamily housing areas who
would not otherwise be labeled as subdividers are required to present
development plans to the Zoning Administrator showing all necessary elements to
determine the flow of water and the retention of water that is currently on the
lot and that is proposed after the expansion to an existing building is
complete.
   (b)   All persons who must comply with this section shall deposit a sum of
two hundred dollars ($200.00) to cover the cost of the development review. This
is a minimum nonrefundable fee and, should the City be charged more than the

review.
(Ord. 203-97. Passed 9-4-97.)
1250.20 PROPERTY ZONED AS PID DISTRICT UNDER FORMER ZONING CODE.

1252.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare by establishing regulations affecting uses and practices which,
were they to be established and maintained without any guidance, restrictions
or control, tend to result in dangerous situations threatening the safety of
citizens, to contribute to circumstances undermining the morals of the youth of
the community or to generate conflicts in uses or practices, thus upsetting the
harmony of the community and impinging upon the property rights of others.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1252.02 SATELLITE DISH ANTENNAS. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section 1252.02 was repealed by Ordinance 197-01, passed

1252.03 AMUSEMENT ARCADES.
   (a)   Application of Section. This section shall apply to amusement arcades.
   (b)   Purpose; Intent; Conflicts. The purpose of this section is to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare by regulating amusement arcades.
It is also the intent of this section to coordinate the provisions of this
Zoning Code with the requirements of any governmental agency governing the
licensing and regulation of mechanical amusement devices so that the more
restrictive requirement or the more severe penalty shall prevail, in the event
of any conflict between the respective regulations.
   (c)   Conditional Use Permit Required. No amusement arcade shall be
established, operated and/or maintained unless it complies with the district
regulations, is authorized by the issuance of a conditional use permit in
accordance with the provisions of
Chapter 1254 and complies with the following criteria:
      (1)   An amusement arcade shall have a person who is eighteen years of
age or older on the premises supervising the amusement arcade at all times
during its hours of operation.
      (2)   When required to do so by the appropriate law enforcement agency,
an amusement arcade shall provide the necessary security personnel to police
the interior and exterior of the premises.
      (3)   Around each amusement device, there shall be a minimum clear area
that extends outward two feet from each side and four feet from the front of
the device. The minimum clear area of one amusement device shall not overlap
the minimum clear area of any other amusement device.
      (4)   Prior to the issuance of a conditional use permit, the applicant
shall provide evidence that the structure and/or premises meets the minimum
requirements of the appropriate building codes, as adopted in Title Two of the
Building and Housing Code, and the Ohio Fire Code, as adopted in Section
1610.01 of the Fire Prevention Code. The operator shall provide the same kind
of evidence to the Zoning Administrator once every twelve months after approval
of the conditional use permit.
      (5)   If the proposed arcade is to be located in a free standing
building, the application for the conditional use permit shall include an
approvable exterior lighting plan.

1254.01 APPLICATION OF CHAPTER.
   The provisions of this chapter apply to the location, maintenance and
administration of any and all conditional uses.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1254.02 FINDINGS; PURPOSE.
   In recent years, the characteristics and impacts of an ever-increasing
number of new and unique uses, together with the broadening and mixing of
numerous conventional uses, have fostered the need for the flexible regulations
designed to accommodate these activities in a reasonable and equitable manner,
while safeguarding both the property rights of all individuals and the health,
safety and general welfare of the community.
   Toward these ends, it is recognized that this Zoning Code should provide for
more detailed evaluation of each use conditionally permissible in a specific
district with respect to such considerations as location, design, size, method
of operation, intensity of use, public facilities requirements and traffic
generation. Accordingly, conditional use permits shall conform to the
procedures and requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1254.03 PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   Any owner of property (or an owner's agent) for which a conditional use is
proposed shall complete an application for a conditional use permit and submit
it to the Zoning Administrator, who shall transmit it (when complete with all
of the required information) to the Board of Zoning Appeals within seven days.
At a minimum, the application shall contain the following information:
   (a)   The name, address and telephone number of the applicant;
   (b)   A legal description of the property;
   (c)   The zoning district;
   (d)   A description of the existing use;
   (e)   A description of the proposed conditional use;
   (f)   A plan of the site for the proposed conditional use showing the
location of all property lines, structures, parking and loading areas, streets
and traffic accesses, open spaces, refuse and service areas, utilities, signs,
yards, landscaping features and such other information as the Board may
require;
   (g)   A list containing the names and mailing addresses of all owners of any
property that has any lot line located within 200 feet of any property line of
the property in question.
   (h)   A fee, as established by ordinance of Council; and
   (i)   A narrative addressing each of the applicable standards and criteria
contained in Sections
1254.04,
1254.05 and
1254.06.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1254.04 REVIEW OF USES BY BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS; GENERAL STANDARDS.
   In addition to the minimum application requirements for conditionally
permitted uses, as specified in Section
1254.03, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall review the particular facts and
circumstances of each proposed use, in terms of the following standards, and
shall find adequate evidence showing that such use at the proposed location:
   (a)   Is in fact a conditional use, according to the Official Schedule of
District Regulations provided in Section
1248.07 adopted for the zoning district involved;
   (b)   Will be in accordance with the general objectives and any specific
objectives of this Zoning Code;
   (c)   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and will not change the essential character
of the same area;
   (d)   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future neighboring
uses;
   (e)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services,
such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures,
refuse disposal, water, sewerage and schools, or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to
adequately provide any such services;
   (f)   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost for
public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community;
   (g)   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and
conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property or
the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, dust,
smoke, fumes, glare or odors;
   (h)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property that will be so
designed as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
streets; and
   (i)   Will not result in the destruction, loss or damage of a natural,
scenic and/or historic feature of major importance.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1254.05 SPECIFIC CRITERIA FOR ALL CONDITIONAL USES.
   All conditional use structures shall be compatible with the general design
scheme of existing structures in the area. Screening and plantings are required
to buffer any non-building structures from adjacent residential uses. All
parking shall be off-street. All sign, lot area, setback, lot coverage and
other requirements of the district, plus requirements of the Fire Prevention
Code (certified by the appropriate official), shall be met.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1254.06 SPECIFIC CRITERIA FOR SELECTED CONDITIONAL USES.
   The following are specific conditional use criteria and requirements for
selected uses conditionally permitted in this Zoning Code. Nothing in this
section shall prohibit the Board of Zoning Appeals from prescribing additional
supplementary conditions and safeguards, in accordance with this chapter. For
each of the following conditional uses, the applicant shall submit a parking
and circulation plan to the Board of Zoning Appeals for approval. The design,
location and nature of the parking areas and vehicular approaches and lanes
shall promote safety, reduce congestion and minimize the impact of such
conditional uses on any adjacent property, including the separation of incoming
and outgoing vehicles and the provision of a safe drop-off point for passengers
that will not impede the traffic flow of other motor vehicles.
   (a)   Bed and Breakfast Facilities.
      (1)   No more than three adults shall occupy each sleeping room. Children
of the adults are permitted in the same occupancy, provided that no more than

longer than two continuous weeks.
      (3)   The facility should contain no more than six sleeping rooms for
guests.
   (b)   Boarding Houses. No more than two persons shall occupy each sleeping
room.
   (c)   Businesses (Office-Type). For office-type businesses, such as the
office of an attorney, architect, accountant, engineer or insurance agency, or

the basis of the nature of the office.
   (d)   Cemeteries.
      (1)   The site shall have direct access to a major thoroughfare that the
Board of Zoning Appeals determines is adequate to serve the size of the
facility proposed.
      (2)   Any new cemetery shall be located on a site containing not less
than five acres.
      (3)   All buildings, including mausoleums and maintenance facilities,

      (1)   The church building shall be set back from any adjacent residential
property line a minimum of fifty feet.
      (2)   Parking is not permitted within twenty feet of any adjacent
property line.
      (3)   Although a cemetery may be related to a church, it is not
necessarily part of a church and must qualify for a conditional use permit on
its own merits.
   (f)   Day Care Centers, Adult and/or Child (Except Type D). Outdoor areas
(such as playgrounds, tot lots and exercise areas) shall be fully enclosed by a
fence, the height and design of which shall be approved by the Board of Zoning

odors shall not be noticeable either on or off the lot.
      (3)   The applicant shall provide a written statement to be approved by
the Board as to the measures and practices, such as building design and the
management or rotation of animals in outdoor exercise runs, that will be taken
to reduce noise levels.

odors shall not be noticeable either on or off the lot.
      (3)   The applicant shall provide a written statement to be approved by
the Board as to measures and practices, such as building design and the
management or rotation of animals in outdoor exercise runs, that will be taken
to reduce noise levels.
      (4)   No dead animals shall be buried on the premises, and incineration
of dead animals shall not create either odors or smoke.
   (l)   Pet Crematory. A pet crematory may be located in London. The operator

(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92; Ord. 192-02. Passed 2-6-03.)
1254.07 PUBLIC HEARINGS; NOTICE.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public hearing within forty
days after it receives a valid application for a conditional use permit.
Property owners within 200 feet will be notified of such public hearing.
(Ord. 133-98. Passed 4-2-98.)
   (b)   Before conducting the public hearing provided for in subsection (a)
hereof, notice of such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of
general circulation in the City at least ten days before the date of such
hearing. The notice shall set forth the time and place of the hearing and
provide a summary explanation of the conditional use proposed.
   (c)   At least ten days prior to conducting the public hearing provided for
in subsection (a) hereof, written notice of such hearing shall be sent by first
class mail by the Zoning Administrator to all property owners listed in the
application. The notice shall contain the same information as provided in
subsection (b) hereof for notices published in newspapers.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1254.08 ACTION BY BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   Within thirty days after the date of the public hearing required in Section
1254.07(a), the Board of Zoning Appeals shall take one of the following
actions:
   (a)   Approve issuance of the conditional use permit by making an
affirmative finding, in writing, that the proposed conditional use is to be
located in a district in which such use may be conditionally permitted, that
all conditions for approval of such use in such district have been met and that
the use will not result in significant negative impacts upon, or conflict with,
surrounding uses. Such written finding may also prescribe supplementary
conditions and safeguards, as specified in Section
1254.09. Upon making this affirmative finding, the Board shall direct the
Zoning Administrator to issue a conditional use permit for such use, and such
permit shall list all conditions and safeguards specified by the Board for
approval.
   (b)   Make a written finding that the application is deficient in
information or is in need of modification and is being returned to the
applicant for completion and resubmission. Such finding shall specify the
information and/or modifications that are deemed necessary. A second newspaper
publication and mailing to property owners may be required. A second fee is
required.
   (c)   Make a written finding that the application is denied and specifying
the reasons for disapproval. If an application is disapproved by the Board, the
applicant may seek relief through the courts, as provided by law.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1254.09 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS; VIOLATIONS.
   In granting approval of any conditional use, the Board of Zoning Appeals may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformance with this Zoning
Code. Any violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the
terms under which the conditional use is granted, shall be deemed a violation
of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1254.10 NUMBER OF USES AUTHORIZED BY PERMIT; DURATION.
   A conditional use permit shall be deemed to authorize only one particular
conditional use. The permit shall automatically expire if such conditionally
permitted use has not been begun, instituted or utilized within one year of the
date on which the permit was issued. If (for any reason other than substantial
delay caused by governmental action) such use shall cease for more than two
years, the permit shall expire automatically.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)

1256.01 PURPOSE.
   The provisions of this chapter apply to the means to be used to determine
whether a proposed use is substantially similar to a use that is listed or
provided for in this Zoning Code so that applicants are not burdened with
securing a text amendment for the establishment of a use that reasonable people
would agree was inadvertently omitted from, or should have been included in,
the text of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1256.02 DETERMINATION THAT AN UNLISTED USE IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO A LISTED
USE.
   Where a property owner proposes a use that is not listed or provided for in
this Zoning Code, the Planning Commission shall make a determination as to
whether the proposed use is substantially similar to a use that is listed or
provided for in this Zoning Code. Thereafter, the substantially similar use
shall be deemed to be a permitted use in those districts where the listed use
is a permitted use, and a conditional use in those districts where the listed
use is a conditionally permitted use. When formulating a similar use
determination, the Commission shall follow the standards set forth in Section
1256.04. Within seven days of the Planning Commission making a determination
that a proposed use is substantially similar to a listed use, the Zoning
Administrator shall notify Council of the Commission's decision, which shall
include written findings stating the reasoning upon which such decision is
based.
   Unless the decision is rejected by a three-fourths vote of Council within
thirty days of Council's receipt of the Planning Commission decision, such
substantially similar use determination by the Commission shall become
effective. All similar use determinations will be incorporated into the next
occurring amendment to this Zoning Code or as a separate amendment within one
year (if there are no intervening amendments), whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1256.03 DENIALS; REMEDY BY AMENDMENT.
   If the Planning Commission determines that a proposed use is not
substantially similar to a listed use, such determination shall not be appealed
to Council, but remedy may be sought by the appellant through the submission of
an application to the Planning Commission for amendment of this Zoning Code, as
prescribed in
Chapter 1146.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1256.04 STANDARDS FOR CONSIDERATION OF UNLISTED USES.
   The following standards shall be considered by the Planning Commission when
making a determination that a use is substantially similar to a permitted or a
conditionally permitted use within a specific district:
   (a)   The compatibility (i.e. the nature, predominant characteristics and
intensity) of the proposed use in relation to the permitted and conditionally
permitted uses in that district.
   (b)   The size, dimensional requirements, parking requirements, traffic
generation potential and other regulatory considerations (such as noise, light,
heat, odor, dust, glare and vibrations) normally associated with uses in that
district, as specified in this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1256.05 EFFECT OF A DETERMINATION THAT AN UNLISTED USE IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR
TO A LISTED USE.
   Should an unlisted use be determined to be substantially similar to a
specific listed permitted or conditionally permitted use provided for in this
Zoning Code, the proposed use shall then be permitted in the same manner and
under the same conditions and procedures as the listed use is permitted.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1256.06 RECORD OF SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR USES.
   The Zoning Administrator shall maintain, as a public record, a listing of
all unlisted uses that have been determined to be substantially similar to
listed uses. For each such use, the record shall include the permitted or
conditional use (as listed in this Zoning Code), the proposed use that was
unlisted in this Zoning Code (about which the approved determination of
substantial similarity was made) and the dates of any approval voted by the
Planning Commission and Council, as well as copies of the similar use
determination. In addition, this record shall contain the same information for
all uses that have been determined not to be substantially similar. Applicants
and the Zoning Administrator should consult this record when considering future
permits.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)

1258.01 RECOGNITION OF NONCONFORMITIES; INTENT.
   Where uses and/or lots were lawful before this Zoning Code was passed or
amended, but are prohibited under the terms of this Zoning Code, the legitimate
interest of those who lawfully established such nonconformities are herein
recognized by providing for their continuance, subject to regulations limiting
their completion, restoration, reconstruction, extension and substitution. It
is the intent of this Zoning Code that such nonconformities be allowed to
continue until destroyed or discontinued, but they shall not be encouraged to
survive. Therefore, a nonconformity may not be moved (except to a district in
which it is a permitted use), extended, altered and/or expanded, nor may it be
used as grounds to establish any other use prohibited elsewhere in the
district, except as otherwise specifically provided for in this chapter.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1258.02 CONDITIONAL USES NOT TO BE CONSIDERED NONCONFORMING.
   Any use that is permitted as a conditional use in a zoning district shall
not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district but, without further action,
shall be considered a conforming use.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1258.03 APPLICATION OF CHAPTER TO USES FOR WHICH A PERMIT HAS BEEN ISSUED.
   Nothing contained in this Zoning Code shall be construed to require any
change in the layout, plans, construction and/or size of any use for which a
zoning permit became effective prior to the effective date of this Zoning Code,
or prior to any amendment to this Zoning Code, that would make a lawfully
established use a nonconforming use. If actual construction has not begun by
the time of the expiration of the zoning permit, the ability to make changes to
a nonconforming use expires with the zoning permit. Actual construction
includes the placing of construction materials in permanent position and
fastening the same in a permanent manner. Where fifty percent of the gross
floor area of an existing structure has been demolished or removed preparatory
to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction, provided that the work shall be carried out diligently.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1258.04 CERTIFICATES; FEES; RECORDS.
   The Zoning Administrator may (upon his or her own initiative) or shall (upon
the request of any owner) issue a certificate for any use that is a valid
nonconforming use. The certificate shall specify the reason why the use is a
nonconforming use, including a description of the extent and kind of use made
of the lot in question, the portion of the structure and/or lot used for the
nonconforming use and the extent to which dimensional or other requirements are
nonconforming.
   It is the responsibility of the property owner to provide proof that the
nonconforming use was a lawfully pre-existing use.
   Because the intent of this section is to protect the owners of lands or
structures that are or become nonconforming, no fee shall be charged for such a
certificate. One copy of the certificate shall be returned to the owner and one
copy shall be retained by the Zoning Administrator, who shall maintain (as a
public record) a file of all such certificates.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1258.05 SUBSTITUTION OF USES; ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS; VIOLATIONS.
   As long as no structural alterations are made, except as required by
enforcement of other codes or ordinances, any nonconforming use may, upon
appeal to, and approval of, the Board of Zoning Appeals, be changed to another
similar nonconforming use of the same or less general intensity classification,
or the Board may find that the use proposed for substitution is equally
appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming
use. In permitting such change, the Board may require that additional
conditions and safeguards be met. Failure to fulfill such conditions shall be
considered a violation of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1258.06 ERECTION OF SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLINGS ON SINGLE NONCONFORMING LOTS OF
RECORD.
   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-
family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single
lot that is of record on the effective date of this Zoning Code or any
amendment that makes a lot nonconforming. Such lot must be in separate
ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots (or portions of lots)
in the same ownership. This section shall apply, even though such lot fails to
meet the requirements for area and/or width in the district. However, the lot
shall conform to the other regulations for the district, unless a variance is
sought from, and approved by, the Board of Zoning Appeals, as provided in
Chapter 1244.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1258.07 CREATION OF NONCONFORMING LOTS PROHIBITED.
   In no case shall any parcel (whether divided or undivided, conforming or
nonconforming) be divided such that a lot with a width or area below the
requirements provided in this Zoning Code is created.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1258.08 CONDITIONS FOR CONTINUATION OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   Where lawful uses of land and/or structures exist at the time of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Code, which uses are not permitted by this Zoning
Code, such uses may be continued, as long as they remain otherwise lawful,
provided that:
   (a)   No such nonconforming uses shall be enlarged, increased or extended to
be more intensive or to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code, but the use may be
altered (upon approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals) to decrease its
nonconformity;
   (b)   No such nonconforming uses shall be moved (in whole or in part) to any
other portion of the lot;
   (c)   Any new use must conform with the requirements of this Zoning Code;
and
   (d)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
structure which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time
of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code, but no such use shall be extended
to occupy any land outside such structure.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1258.09 NONCONFORMING STATUS OF STRUCTURES AND LAND IN COMBINATION.
   When nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall also eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land. Similarly, a change in the use of the land to
a permitted use shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the structure.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1258.10 DISCONTINUED OR ABANDONED USES.
   When any nonconforming use and/or structure is discontinued or abandoned for
more than two years (except when governmental action impedes access to the
premises), any subsequent use and/or structure shall be in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located, and the nonconforming use
and/or structure may not be resumed. The intent to continue a nonconforming use
shall not be evidence of its continuance.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1258.11 DAMAGED STRUCTURES.
   In the event that any nonconforming structure is destroyed, by any means, to
the extent of more than fifty percent of the cost of replacement of such
structure, exclusive of foundation, it shall not be rebuilt, restored or
reoccupied for any use, unless it conforms to all of the requirements of this
Zoning Code. When such a nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed to the
extent of less than fifty percent of the cost of replacement, repair,
rebuilding and/or reoccupancy, the rebuilt portion shall be permitted only in
conformity with all applicable regulations of this Zoning Code, including the
following conditions:
   (a)   A zoning certificate pertaining to the former use, structure and/or
occupancy shall be applied for and issued within one year of such destruction.
Rebuilding shall be diligently pursued to completion.
   (b)   Such restoration shall not cause a new nonconformity, nor shall it
increase the degree of nonconformance or noncompliance existing prior to such
damage or destruction.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1258.12 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   Ordinary repairs may be performed on any nonconforming structure or portion
of a structure containing a nonconforming use. Ordinary repairs include
activities such as repairs or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring
and plumbing, provided that the cubic volume of the structure existing when it
became nonconforming shall not be increased.
   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoration to a safe condition of any structure or part of a structure
declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public
health, safety and/or general welfare, upon order of such official. Where
appropriate, a building permit for such activities shall be required.

1260.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate accessory uses in order to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare. It is the intent of this
chapter to permit accessory uses to be established and maintained in a manner
that makes them compatible with principal uses and harmonious with uses upon
adjacent properties.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1260.02 PERMITTED USES; USE OF ACCESSORY STRUCTURES, TRAVEL TRAILERS OR
RECREATIONAL VEHICLES FOR DWELLING PURPOSES.
   Except as otherwise provided in this Zoning Code, an accessory use shall be
permitted in association with a principal use. If the accessory use is a
structure, it shall not contain or be used as a dwelling unit, except that on
any Residential District lot or nonconforming residential lot, a travel trailer
or recreational vehicle may be used temporarily as a dwelling unit for a
maximum of seventy-two hours at a time and no more than four times in any 365-
day period.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1260.03 CONTINUATION OF USE OF STRUCTURES AND VEHICLES FOR DWELLING PURPOSES.
   A detached inhabited structure (such as a carriage house, servants' quarters
or garage apartment) that is being used as a dwelling unit at the time that
this Zoning Code is adopted may continue as a nonconforming accessory use in
Residential Districts. Mobile homes, recreational vehicles and travel trailers
are not permitted as accessory uses, except as a temporary dwelling unit as
described in Section
1260.02 or as temporary office, tool and/or equipment areas during
construction.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1260.04 RETAIL SALES AND SERVICES.
   A limited range of usual retail sales and services may be permitted as
accessory uses in nonresidential districts when clearly related to (but
incidental to) the principal use. With the exception of restaurants operating
in conjunction with a motel, such retail sales and services uses shall be
conducted wholly within the principal building and without exterior signs,
advertising or displays. These activities shall be conducted solely for the
convenience of the employees, patients, patrons, students and/or visitors and
not for the general public. In hospitals and clinics, these accessory uses may
include drug stores, florists, gift shops, book stores and/or food services. In
institutional settings, office buildings, hotels, country club houses and
airports, such activities may include gift shops, book stores, restaurants,
cafeterias, coffee shops, lounges, pro shops, beauty salons and/or barber
shops.

1262.01 APPLICATION OF CHAPTER.
   This chapter shall apply to the location and maintenance of PUD Planned Unit
Development Districts.
(Ord. 125-97. Passed 4-3-97.)
1262.02 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare by providing for the regulation of planned unit developments.
It is the intent of these regulations to provide maximum opportunity for
orderly large-scale developments that benefit the community as a whole by
offering a greater choice of living environments, a wider range of development
plans featuring a more complementary blending of land uses, which shall include
community facilities and open space, and a more unified approach with respect
to the mixture of uses and their adaption to topographical and geological
features, recreation opportunities and transportation needs.
(Ord. 125-97. Passed 4-3-97.)
1262.03 CONFLICTS.
   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way impair
or interfere with existing regulations of other laws or ordinances, except
those specifically repealed by these regulations. Where these regulations
impose greater restrictions upon land than are imposed or required by other
provisions of law or ordinance, contract or deed, the provisions of these
regulations shall control. Whenever the requirements of this chapter appear to
be in conflict with other requirements of this Zoning Code, Subdivision
Regulations or other codes, or if it is unable to be determined whether one is
more restrictive than the other, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
(Ord. 125-97. Passed 4-3-97.)
1262.04 DESIGNATION OF DISTRICTS; ANNOTATION OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   After approval of a preliminary development plan by Council, the subject
property shall be considered to be rezoned to Planned Unit Development (PUD)
District, and the Official Zoning Map shall be so annotated for the land area
affected.
(Ord. 125-97. Passed 4-3-97.)
1262.05 PERMITTED USES; APPROVAL BY PLANNING COMMISSION; LOCATION; MIXED USES.
   As the Official Schedule of District Regulations provided in Section
1248.07 shows, various land uses (such as dwelling units, business,
manufacturing and a public service facility) may be combined in a planned unit
development. However, even though each use is to be treated as a conditionally
permitted use, approval shall be made by the Planning Commission rather than by
the Board of Zoning Appeals because a planned unit development approval is a
rezoning approval.
   The proposed location of any planned unit development or any use within it
shall not adversely affect adjacent property or the public health, safety and/
or general welfare. The location of all uses within a planned unit development
shall be specified in the approved final development plan. All mixed uses shall
conform to the general planning characteristics that have been developed by the
City of London in its Comprehensive Plan, this Zoning Code and the Subdivision
Regulations.
   When the proposed Planned Unit Development (PUD) District contains a mixture
of residential uses with business and/or manufacturing uses, the amount of land
devoted to business and/or manufacturing use in a residential, business,
manufacturing or residential business development may be determined by the
Planning Commission with the approval of Council.
(Ord. 125-97. Passed 4-3-97.)
1262.06 OPEN SPACES AND RECREATIONAL AREAS.
   At least twenty percent of any tract proposed for a planned unit development
project shall be reserved for common open space and/or outdoor recreational
areas for the residents and/or users of the area being developed.
   Each principal use in a planned unit development shall abut common open
space or similar areas, and have effective access to such space. All
residential uses shall have effective access to such space.
   The open space reserved under a planned unit development shall be:
   (a)   Held in corporate ownership by the owners of the project area for the
use of each property owner or renter in the project;
   (b)   Dedicated to a homeowner's association that shall have title to the
property, which property shall be retained as open space for parks, recreation
and related common uses; or
   (c)   Dedicated to public purposes and accepted by the City through proper
planning or ordinances to build and titled in either the City Local School
District or other public entity that can accept property for purposes of
dedication to public purposes.
   In any of the above cases, documentation is required to show that provisions
have been made for the perpetual care and maintenance of all common areas. The
Planning Commission may require changes to the proposed by-laws of the
homeowner's association. After adoption, such by-laws may not be changed
without Planning Commission approval.
   Public utility and similar easements and rights of way are not acceptable
for common open space dedication, unless such land or right of way is usable as
a trail or other open space use and has been approved for open space use by the
Planning Commission.
(Ord. 125-97. Passed 4-3-97.)
1262.07 UNDERGROUND UTILITIES.
   Underground utilities (such as telephone, natural gas, cable television and
electricity), as distinguished from above-ground pipes and wires from pole to
pole, are required within the limits of any planned unit development.
Appurtenances to these utilities that can be screened effectively may be
exempted from this underground requirement if the Planning Commission finds
that such an exemption will not violate the intent or character of the proposed
planned unit development.
(Ord. 125-97. Passed 4-3-97.)
1262.08 LOT, YARD, SETBACK AND OTHER DISTRICT REQUIREMENTS FOR PROPOSED USES.
   For each use proposed, the most restrictive district requirements for that
use, as shown in the Official Schedule of District Regulations provided in
Section
1248.07 and the Official Schedule of Off-Street Parking Regulations provided in
Section
1266.08, shall apply, except as stated elsewhere in this chapter.
   With Planning Commission approval, the lot requirements for a planned unit
development may vary from the requirements of the most restrictive district, as
follows:
   (a)   Lot area per dwelling unit requirements may be reduced by up to
twenty-five percent.
   (b)   Lot width, setback and yard requirements may be varied to accommodate
a variety of structural patterns, clustering designs and housing types.
However, the total of all reductions must be matched by an equal total of
increases, except as provided elsewhere in this chapter.
   (c)   To promote the availability of lower and moderately priced (as
determined by the Planning Commission) rental and owner residences within a
planned unit development, the Planning Commission may permit a bonus reduction
in yard, lot area and setback requirements (with no compensating yard, lot or
setback increases required) of one percent for every one percent of the total
number of dwelling units that are lower and moderately priced, up to a maximum
bonus reduction of twenty-five percent. Adequate screening, buffering and/or
other separation is required when a bonus reduction is used.
(Ord. 125-97. Passed 4-3-97.)
1262.09 DESIGN OF BUSINESS AND/OR MANUFACTURING USES.
   When a PUD Planned Unit Development District includes business and/or
manufacturing uses, business buildings and manufacturing establishments shall
have common parking areas and common ingress and egress points in order to
reduce the number of potential accident locations at intersections with
streets.
   Walls, fences and/or planting screens shall be provided where business and/
or manufacturing areas abut residential properties and/or Residential
Districts. The plan of the project shall provide for the integrated and
harmonious design of buildings, for adequate and properly arranged facilities
for internal traffic circulation, for landscaping and such other features and
facilities that may be necessary to make the project attractive and efficient
for the project's residents, customers and workers, as well as for the
adjoining and surrounding residential and other areas.
   All areas designed for future expansion or not intended for immediate
improvement or development in the planned unit development shall be landscaped
or otherwise maintained in a neat and orderly manner, as specified by the
Planning Commission.
(Ord. 125-97. Passed 4-3-97.)
1262.10 APPROVAL OF DISTRICTS; PRELIMINARY AND FINAL PLANS.
   (a)   In General; Intent. A PUD Planned Unit Development District shall be
approved in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. It is the
intent of this section to incorporate the process for reviewing and approving
the development plans with the process for amending the text of this Zoning
Code and the Official Zoning Map, as set forth in
Chapter 1246.
   (b)   Pre-Application Meetings. The developer or an agent of the developer
shall meet with the Zoning Administrator and the Planning Commission prior to

written approval of the City Engineer, the Board of Public Utilities and/or the
Fire Chief must be submitted.
   (d)   Public Hearings by Planning Commission for Preliminary Development
Plans;
Notice.
      (1)   Upon receipt of an application for preliminary planned unit
development plan approval, the Planning Commission shall schedule a public
hearing. Said hearing shall be held not more than seventy-five days nor less
than one Planning Commission Meeting from the date of filing of the application
with the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)   Upon receipt of an application to amend this Zoning Code by
changing, supplementing, correcting and/or repealing any portion thereof, the
Planning Commission shall schedule a public hearing. Said hearing shall be held
not more than forty days nor less than twenty days from the date of filing of
the application with the Zoning Administrator.
      (3)   Notice of the public hearing provided for in paragraphs (d)(1) and
(2) hereof shall be given by at least one publication in one or more newspapers
of general circulation in the City area. Said notice shall be published at
least ten days before the date of the required hearing. The published notice

list, and to such other persons as may be specified by the Planning Commission.
The failure of the United States Postal Service to deliver the notification as
provided in this paragraph shall not invalidate any such amendment. The notice
shall contain the same information as required of notices published in
newspapers.
   (e)   Public Inspection of Documents. For a period of at least ten days
prior to the public hearing by the Planning Commission, all papers (including
maps) relating to the planned unit development plan application shall be
available for public inspection in the office of the Zoning Administrator
during normal business hours.
   (f)   Preliminary Development Plan Approval. The Planning Commission shall
approve, approve with modifications or disapprove the preliminary development
plan within sixty days of the public hearing. The Commission's decision shall
be based on a review of the preliminary development plan to determine if:
      (1)   It is consistent with the intent of this Zoning Code;
      (2)   The proposed development advances the general welfare of the
community and neighborhood;
      (3)   The benefits, combination of land uses and interrelationship of
land uses in the surrounding area justify the deviation from the standard
district regulations; and
      (4)   The plan, if pertaining to manufacturing industrial usage, has been
reviewed and acted upon by the Citizens Advisory Committee for Industrial
Development as provided for in Section
1242.06.
   The Commission's approval of a preliminary development plan shall be
necessary before the applicant may submit the preliminary development plan to
Council for consideration of the change of zoning. Approval of the preliminary
development plan shall not be construed to be an approval commitment to, nor is
it an endorsement of, any precise location of uses, configuration of parcels
and/or engineering feasibility.
   (g)   Notice to Ohio Director of Transportation. Before any PUD Planned Unit
Development District is approved affecting any land within 300 feet of the
centerline of an existing state route or of a proposed new route for which
changes are proposed (as described in the certification to local officials by
the Ohio Director of Transportation) or within a radius of 500 feet from the
point of intersection of said centerline with any public road or highway, the
Planning Commission shall give notice by registered or certified mail (return
receipt requested) to the Director.
   The Commission may proceed as required by law. However, Council shall not
approve the amendment for 120 days from the date the notice is received by the
Director.
   If the Director notifies the City that the Director shall proceed to acquire
the land needed, the City shall refuse to approve the rezoning. If the Director
notifies the City that acquisition at this time is not in the public interest,
or upon the expiration of the 120-day period (or any extension of the period
agreed upon by the Director and the developer), Council shall proceed as
required by law.
   (h)   Public Hearings by Council; Notice.
      (1)   Upon receipt of the recommendation from the Planning Commission,
Council shall schedule a public hearing to approve or disapprove the
preliminary development plan. Said hearing shall be held not more than seventy-
five days from the receipt of the recommendation of the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Notice of the public hearing required in paragraph (h)(1) hereof
shall be given by Council in at least one publication in one or more newspapers
of general circulation in the City area. Said notice shall be published at
least thirty days before the date of the required hearing. The published notice
shall set forth the time and place of the public hearing, a general summary of
the nature of the planned unit development and a statement that all papers
relating to the planned unit development are on file in the office of the
Zoning Administrator and are open for public inspection. Also, written notice
of the hearing shall be sent by first class mail by the Clerk of Council, at
least twenty days before the day of the public hearing. Such written notice
shall be sent to all owners of any property that has any lot located within 200
feet of any property line of the proposed planned unit development parcel, at
the addresses of such owners appearing on the County Auditor's current tax list
or the Treasurer's mailing list, and to such other persons who may be specified
by Council. The failure of the United States Postal Service to deliver the
notification, as provided in this paragraph, shall not invalidate any such
amendment. The notice shall contain the same information as required of notices
published in newspapers.
   (i)   Action by Council. Within thirty days after the public hearing
required by subsection (h) hereof, Council shall adopt or deny the
recommendation of the Planning Commission or adopt some modification of it. No
such ordinance, measure, or regulation which violates, differs from, or departs
from the plan or report submitted by the commission, board, or officer shall
take effect unless passed or approved by not less than three-fourths of the
membership of Council. No ordinance, measure, or regulation which is in
accordance with the recommendations, plan, or report submitted by the
commission, board, or officer shall be deemed to pass or take effect without
the concurrence of at least a majority of the members elected to Council. No
such amended zoning ordinance for a planned unit development shall be passed
unless it has been fully and distinctly read on three different days.
   The approved PUD District shall be considered to be an integral part of the
rezoning amendment, and no substantial change or alteration from the plan shall
be permitted without repeating the requirements of this chapter.
   (j)   Supplementary Conditions and Safeguards; Violations. In approving any
planned unit development application, both the Planning Commission and Council
may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this
Zoning Code. Any violation of conditions and safeguards that were made a part
of the approved PUD District development plan shall constitute a violation of
this Zoning Code.
   (k)   Submission of Final Development Plans. After approval of the PUD
District by Council, the developer shall submit a final development plan to the
Zoning Administrator. The final development plan shall be in general
conformance with the approved preliminary development plan as passed by
Council.
   For the purpose of this Zoning Code, the submission of the final development
plan is a formal request for planning of the property. Ten copies of the final
development plan shall be submitted.
   (l)   Final Development Plan Applications: Contents. An application for
approval of a final development plan shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator by the developer of the property for which a planned unit
development is proposed. The developer shall attest that all information in the
application is true and correct to the best of the developer's knowledge.
   Each application for approval of a final development plan shall clearly
state that the approval, if received, shall expire and may be revoked if
construction of the project has not begun within two years of the date of

certified to the Board of Elections. Once certified to the Board of Elections,
the effective date of the Zoning Map amendment setting the Planned Unit
Development District in place shall become effective upon its approval by the
voters and certification of the election results by the Madison County Board of
Elections.
(Ord. 125-97. Passed 4-3-97.)
1262.12 DURATION OF APPROVAL PERIOD FOR FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS.
   The approval of the final development plan for a PUD Planned Unit
Development District shall be for a period of up to five years, in order to
allow for the preparation and recording of any plat and development of the
site. If no construction has begun within two years after the final approval by
the Planning Commission, the approved final development plan district shall be
void and the zoning of the land shall revert to the district in which it was
located as modified by any subsequent nonplanned unit development rezoning that
might have occurred in the interim.
   If construction in a Planned Unit Development District, that has been
approved by the Planning Commission, has not started within two years of the
date of approval thereof, the developer may come back to the Planning
Commission and ask for an extension of up to one year to begin construction.
The Planning Commission shall extend the time allowed in one year increments
upon presentation of a valid reason for not having started the construction on
the area that has been finally approved by the Planning Commission. At no time
shall the extension exceed the time limit (five years) allowed under this
Zoning Code for the Planned Unit Development District.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
1264.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the City
Council does ordain the following regulations.
(Ord. 118-10. Passed 6-3-10.)
1264.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 118-10. Passed 6-3-10.)
1264.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas,
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 118-10. Passed 6-3-10.)
1264.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 118-10. Passed 6-3-10.)
1264.05 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City as identified in Section
1264.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
City.
(Ord. 118-10. Passed 6-3-10.)
1264.06 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (a)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Madison County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Madison County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
effective July 6, 2010.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City as required by Section
1264.43, Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   (b)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Mayor's office, 6 E. Second Street, London,
Ohio 43140.
(Ord. 118-10. Passed 6-3-10; Ord. 140-10. Passed 7-1-10.)
1264.07 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 118-10. Passed 6-3-10.)
1264.08 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 118-10. Passed 6-3-10.)
1264.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 118-10. Passed 6-3-10.)
1264.10 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   "Accessory structure" means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   "Appeal" is a request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   "Base flood" is the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the
one percent chance annual flood or 100-year flood.
   (d)   "Base (100-Year) flood elevation (BFE)" means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in feet mean sea level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from one to three feet).
   (e)   "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   "Development" means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   "Enclosure below the lowest floor." See "Lowest floor."
   (h)   "Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)," issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no Federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   "Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)" is the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   "Fill" means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   "Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   "Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM)" is usually the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
   (m)   "Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" is an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   "Flood insurance risk zones" are zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   "Flood insurance study (FIS)" is the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on flood boundary and floodway maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   "Flood protection elevation (FPE)" is the base flood elevation. In
areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the
flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   "Floodway."
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   "Freeboard" is a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   "Historic structure" is any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office; or
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by London's historic preservation program, which program is certified by the
Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   "Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis" is an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   "Letter of map chance (LOMC)" is an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary
and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   "Letter of map amendment (LOMA)" is a revision based on technical
data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special
flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map
and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood
hazard area.
      (2)   "Letter of map revision (LOMR)" is a revision based on technical
data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   "Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR)" is a formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, or flood insurance studies.
   (v)   "Lowest floor" is the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   "Manufactured home" is a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a recreational vehicle. For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   "Manufactured home park," as specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured
homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue
purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure
used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land
that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are
for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the
lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured
homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (y)   "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)" is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   "New construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City
Flood Insurance Rate Map, July 2, 1987 and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
   (aa)   "Person" includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including State and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, State college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or State community college. "Agency" does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (bb)   "Recreational vehicle" is a vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (cc)   "Registered professional architect" is a person registered to engage
in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (dd)   "Registered professional engineer" is a person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   "Registered professional surveyor" is a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   "Special flood hazard area," also known as "areas of special flood
hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood
insurance studies, flood boundary and floodway maps and flood hazard boundary
maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other Federal,
State or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   "Start of construction" is the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
(hh)   "Structure" is a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   "Substantial damage" is damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   "Substantial improvement" is any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction";
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   "Variance" is a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   "Violation" is the failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
(Ord. 118-10. Passed 6-3-10.)

the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Section
1264.60 through
1264.65, Appeals and Variances.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
(Ord. 118-10. Passed 6-3-10.)
1264.31 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
Federal, State, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (3)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (c)(1)A. to K. hereof
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. 118-10. Passed 6-3-10.)
1264.64 PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (a)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
   (b)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
   (c)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony in
support of the appeal or variance.
   (d)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition to
the appeal or variance.

attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
   (h)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its decision.
The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and thereafter
issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a reasonable
time after the hearing.
(Ord. 118-10. Passed 6-3-10.)

1266.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare by requiring off-street parking and loading facilities in order
to reduce the number of traffic accidents and to lessen traffic congestion.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92; Ord. 130-03. Passed 7-17-03.)
1266.02 PARKING REQUIRED; PLANS.
   (a)   Any time a structure and/or use of land in any district is erected,
enlarged and/or increased in capacity or use, off-street parking and loading
spaces for automobiles and delivery vehicles shall be provided in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter.
   For structures and/or uses constructed or established after the effective
date of this Zoning Code, words such as erected, enlarged and/or increased in
capacity or use mean cumulative changes and/or enlargements in floor area,
number of employees, number of dwelling units, seating capacity and/or similar
impacts that will create a need for an increase of ten percent or more in the
number of existing parking spaces.
   For structures and/or uses existing prior to the effective date of this
Zoning Code, words such as erected, enlarged and/or increased in capacity or
use mean cumulative changes and/or enlargements in floor area, number of
employees, number of dwelling units, seating capacity and/or similar impacts
that will create a need for an increase of fifty percent or more in the number
of existing parking spaces. Once so created, enlarged and/or increased in
capacity and/or use, such prior existing structure and/or use shall be
considered to be constructed or established after the effective date of this
Zoning Code, for the purposes of this chapter. This plan requirement is not to
be effective in the downtown Historic District area, as defined in Section
1464.06(a) of these Codified Ordinances.
   (b)   A parking plan shall be required for all structures and/or uses that
are required to provide more than five parking spaces. The parking plan shall
be submitted to the Zoning Administrator as a part of the application for a
zoning permit. The plan shall show the boundaries of the property, the proposed
facilities (such as parking spaces, loading spaces, entrances and exits,
circulation areas and patterns, drainage facilities and boundary walls and/or
fences) and a screening plan (when required).

following rules shall apply:
   (a)   Where floor area is designated as the standard for determining parking
space requirements, the net floor area shall apply.
   (b)   Where seating capacity is the standard for determining parking space
requirements, the definition of "seat," as provided in Section

1610.01 of the Fire Prevention Code.
   (c)   Fractional numbers shall be increased to the next larger whole number.
   (d)   The parking space requirements for a use not specified in this Zoning

(Ord. 179-02. Passed 1-2-03; Ord. 199-19. Passed 10-17-19.)
1268.04 MEASUREMENT STANDARDS.
   (a)   Sign face area, sign height and sign location, as regulated in this
chapter, shall be measured according to the following standards.
      (1)   Measurement of sign face area. For the sign types defined in
Section
1268.03(d), sign face area shall be measured as follows:
         A.   Panel signs. Area shall be measured to include the entire
enclosed surface area. The area of both sides of double-sided signs shall be
included in the measurement.
         B.   Nonpanel signs. Area shall be measured to include the surface
area of the smallest single rectangle completely enclosing all of the letters
or characters of the sign.
         C.   Three-dimensional object signs. Area shall be measured to include
all surface area which forms a part of the message conveyed by a sign. Such
measurement, along with necessary calculations, shall be submitted by the
applicant with the application.
      (2)   Measurement of building and lot frontage.
         A.   Building frontage. The frontage of a building shall be the width
of the facade which faces the principal street in a business district, the
Board of Zoning Appeals may allow, as additional building frontage, the width
of other facades of the building which contain the public entrances and faces
the required parking areas. If a building is divided into units, the building
unit frontage shall be the width of that unit, as measured from the party wall
centerlines.
         B.   Lot frontage. The frontage of a lot shall be the number of lineal
feet the lot abuts on the principal street.
   (b)   Sign Height. The height of signs supported from the ground shall be
measured from the base of the sign at its point of attachment to the ground to
its topmost element. However, if such sign is attached to a wall or other
human-made base, including a graded earth mound, the sign height shall be
measured from the grade of the general area.
   (c)   Sign Location. In determining the location of signs in relation to lot
lines (including district and street lines), distances shall be measured from
the vertical projection of the lot line (LL) or street right-of-way (ROW) to
the closest point on the sign.
(Ord. 179-02. Passed 1-2-03.)
1268.05 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   In order to facilitate legibility of information, traffic safety, and
economic vitality, signs shall be of professional quality, designed in a manner
compatible with the character and style of the buildings on which they are
located, adjoining buildings and neighboring signs. Signs shall be structurally
sound and located so as to pose no safety hazard.
   (a)   Style and Color. A sign shall be generally consistent throughout the
particular building or block involved and the color of signs shall be
compatible with the color of the building facade, and other existing signs. No
more than four compatible colors may be used on any sign (including the sign
face and base). (Excluding black & white). Color combinations that do not meet
this requirement may apply for a variance through the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Lettering. The lettering on a sign shall be large enough to be easily
and safely read from the normal visual location. However, the lettering shall
not be overly large or out of scale with the building. An excessive amount of
information that could create a potential safety hazard shall not be permitted.
   (c)   Materials. Signs shall be fabricated on and of materials of good
quality, good weathering and durability and complimentary to their building.
Outdoor signs and display structures, including the supporting structure and
all parts, shall be of noncombustible material when required by the Building
Code.
   (d)   Illumination.
      (1)   External. External illumination may be permitted when direct rays
from external light sources to illuminate signs have adequate shielding to
prevent these rays from shining around or underneath the signs or onto adjacent
residential buildings and streets and shall not be of high intensity or
brightness so as to cause glare hazardous to pedestrians or auto drivers or so
as to cause reasonable objection from adjacent buildings. External illumination
may be from the front or rear of the sign.
      (2)   Internal. Internal illumination may be permitted only on wall
signs, pole signs, and ground mounted signs in Business Districts and
Manufacturing Districts.
   (e)   Source of Illumination. Any illuminated sign or lighting device shall
employ only light of constant intensity. No sign shall contain or be
illuminated by a flashing or intermittent light. This subsection shall not
exclude a bulletin board that scrolls or presents movement to change its
message from time to time. The bulletin board shall not exceed the largest
signage area otherwise permitted in the district. No illuminated sign or
lighting device shall cause glare or reflection that may constitute a nuisance
or traffic hazard.
   (f)   Relation to Traffic Devices. Signs visible from the sight lines along
a street shall not contain an arrow or words such as “stop,” “go,” “slow,” and
the like; and the movement, content, coloring or manner of illumination shall
not resemble traffic-control signs or signals.
(Ord. 179-02. Passed 1-2-03; Ord. 177-13. Passed 9-19-13; Ord. 199-19. Passed

signs shall not be less than ten feet above the finished grade of a pedestrian
way. If located over a pavement used for traffic, the signs shall not be less
than sixteen feet above the finished pavement and at least one foot away from
the vertical projection of the edge of the pavement.
      (3)   Relation to traffic devices. Signs shall not be erected so as to
obstruct sight lines of pedestrians or motorists along any public way, from
traffic-control devices, street name signs at intersections, or signals at
railroad grade crossings.
      (4)   Relation to openings. Signs shall not project over or obstruct the
required window or doors of any building, fire escape or interfere with other
safety provisions.
      (5)   Public land. No signs shall be located or project into public lands
except for municipal and governmental signs.

1270.01 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   The height, location and placement of fences and/or walls shall conform to
the requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1270.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote and protect the public health,
safety and general welfare by regulating the height, location and types of
fences and/or walls. It is intended to protect property values, to create a
more visually attractive community, to prevent the undue blockage of light and
air to adjacent properties, to protect the public from fences and/or walls that
could cause injury and to allow privacy while allowing access to the property
by emergency and protective personnel and/or vehicles.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1270.03 ZONING PERMIT REQUIRED; NONCONFORMING USES.
   No fence and/or wall shall be erected or placed without a valid zoning
permit being first obtained. A fence and/or wall existing prior to the adoption
of this Zoning Code does not require a permit to continue, but does require a
permit to rebuild one-half or more of the structure or to expand and/or
increase any portion.
   For purposes of this section, a fence and/or wall is a structure.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1270.04 HEIGHT AND PLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Height. Fences and wall shall not exceed six feet in height, except as
specifically permitted in subsections (e) and (f) hereof and Section
1250.15.
   (b)   Front Yard Prohibition. No fence or wall shall be permitted in a front
yard, except that ornamental fences shall be permitted as regulated in this
section.
   (c)   Corner Lots. The front yard shall be determined by the address of the
property. A fence may be placed on the yard that is not considered the front
yard. The fence may not be within twenty feet of the corner of the property.
Additionally, a fence or wall on a corner lot shall not extend into the clear
site zone.
   (d)   Ornamental Fences in Front Yards. Ornamental fences in a front yard
shall not exceed four feet in height, and shall require a fence permit.
   (e)   Fences Surrounding Recreational Facilities. Fences surrounding
recreational facilities, including but not limited to tennis courts, swimming
pools, etc., located on a commonly owned lot in any district, shall be
permitted up to ten feet in height.
   (f)   Manufacturing Fences, Fences Surrounding Utility Equipment. Fences or
walls in Manufacturing Districts, and fences surrounding utility or mechanical
equipment may be up to eight feet in height if such fence or wall is necessary
to screen such equipment. In no case shall a wall or fence, including
underground pet barriers known as “invisible fences,” be located in the right-
of-way.
   (g)   Construction of Fences and Walls. Fences and walls may be constructed
out of weather-treated wood, stone, concrete, brick, wrought iron, vinyl, or
chain link.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92; Ord. 134-98. Passed 4-2-98; Ord. 178-02. Passed
12-19-02; Ord. 147-04. Passed 7-15-04; Ord. 153-21. Passed 6-3-21.)
1270.05 PROHIBITED LOCATIONS.
   (a)   The clear sight zone of a corner lot shall contain no part of a fence
and/or wall.
   (b)   No fence and/or wall shall be placed and/or erected so that any four-
foot or longer portion of the structure is closer than twenty-five inches to
any other structure, except for the portion that terminates the fence and/or
wall or except as provided in Section
1270.04.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1270.06 PROHIBITED TYPES.
   (a)   Fences and/or walls that have points and/or edges intended to be
cutting rather than ornamental are prohibited between residential lots.
   (b)   Barbed wire and/or electrified fences and/or walls shall be prohibited
between residential lots, except for use in the penning or fencing in of
agricultural livestock. This agricultural use shall be permitted only if the
Zoning Administrator determines that the voltage to be used cannot harm, injure
and/or incapacitate a person and only if the fence and/or wall is plainly
marked, stating that the fence and/or wall is electrified.
(Ord. 186-91. Passed 10-15-92.)
1270.07 DETERMINATION OF HEIGHT.
   The height of a fence and/or wall shall be measured along all points of the
structure (or, at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator, at representative
points) so that no portion of the structure, as measured from the top of the
ground (adjacent to the structure) to the highest point of the structure, shall
exceed the limitations provided in this chapter.
   Where the ground under a fence and/or wall is to be graded or mounded to a
level higher than the general level of the surrounding ground (on both sides of
the proposed structure), the height of the graded or mounded area that is
higher than the general level of the surrounding ground on both sides of the
proposed structure shall be considered to be a part of the height of the
structure in meeting the height limitations of Section
1270.04.

   (b)   The Building Inspector is authorized to serve an order on the owner
responsible for the erection, construction, alteration, extension, repair,
moving, removal, demolition or occupancy of a building or structure. When the
Building Inspector finds that work or equipment is contrary to approved

specifications for approval as required under section 105.3 of OAC 4101:1-1-01.
   (c)   Upon the issuance of any order provided for in this section or in

completed, or the order has been released.
   (d)   When an owner fails to file construction documents as required under
Ohio R.C. 3791.04 and fails to comply with an adjudication order relating
thereto and issued under section 113.1 of OAC 4101:1-1-01, the owner may be

expired, then the construction documents required under Ohio R.C. 3791.04 are
deemed not to have been filed and approved, and the conditions of section 113.4
of OAC 4101:1-1-01 apply.
   (f)   Whenever the Building Inspector finds any work regulated by the OBC,
as adopted in Section
1420.01, being performed in a manner contrary to the provisions of said code or
in a dangerous or unsafe manner, the Building Inspector is authorized to issue
a stop work order whenever the building official finds, after inspection, that
the site preparations or structure to be constructed, or in the case of an
industrialized unit, the installation of the unit, or that the use of an
appliance, materials, assemblage, or manufactured product does not comply with
the provisions of Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and 3791 or the rules adopted
pursuant thereto. The effect of such an order shall be limited to the matter
specified in the order.
   (g)   The stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given to the
owner of the property involved, or to the owner's agent and the person doing
the work. Upon issuance of a stop work order, the cited work shall immediately
cease. The stop work order shall state the reason for the order, and the
conditions under which the cited work will be permitted to resume.
   (h)   Any person who shall continue any work after having been served with a
stop work order, except such work as that person is directed to perform to
remove a violation or unsafe condition. Failure to cease work after receipt of
a stop work order is hereby declared a public nuisance.
(OAC 4101:1-1-01, sections 113 and 114)

Municipal corporations, under Ohio R.C. 3781.01, may make further and
additional regulations, not in conflict with Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and 3791
or with the rules of the board of building standards. However, under Ohio R.C.
3781.12, approval by the board of building standards of any fixture, device,
material, system, assembly or product of a manufacturing process, or method or
manner of construction or installation shall constitute approval for their use
anywhere in Ohio.

board of building standards shall supersede and govern any order, standard, or
rule of the division of the fire marshal or industrial compliance in the

townships, in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are in conflict
with the rules of the board of building standards, except that rules adopted
and orders issued by the fire marshal pursuant to Chapter 3743 of the ORC
prevail in the event of a conflict.
(OAC 4101:1-1-01, section 102)
   (c)   Whenever a provision of the OBC, as adopted in Section
1420.01, conflicts with a provision of a local ordinance, resolution, rule or
regulation, the provision of the OBC shall control.

1420.01, conflicts with a provision of any other standard technical code
adopted by the Municipality, other than as provided in subsection (b) hereof,
the stricter or higher standard shall control.
   (e)   When a special provision is made in a use group classification of the
OBC and is inconsistent with a general provision of the OBC, as adopted in
Section
1420.01, relating to buildings generally, the special provision governs, unless
it appears that the provisions are cumulative.

1422.01 2006 EDITION ADOPTED; FUTURE EDITIONS.
   (a)   Pursuant to Ohio Revised Code (ORC) § 731.231, there is hereby adopted
by and for the City the Residential Code of Ohio for One, Two and Three Family
Dwellings (RCO), being particularly the 2006 edition thereof, as promulgated by
the Ohio Board of Building Standards, and as published in Division 4101:8 of
the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC), save and except such portions thereof as
may be hereinafter amended or deleted.
   (b)   Future editions of the RCO, or any amendments or revisions thereof,

(Ord. 143-08. Passed 6-5-08.)
1422.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the RCO, as adopted in Section
1422.01, is to establish uniform requirements for the erection, construction,
repair, alteration, and maintenance of residential buildings, including
construction of industrialized units. Such requirements shall relate to the
conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation of buildings for their intended
use and occupancy with consideration for the following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended. Further, the rules shall consider the
following:
      (1)   The impact that the state residential building code may have upon
the health, safety, and welfare of the public;
      (2)   The economic reasonableness of the residential building code;
      (3)   The technical feasibility of the residential building code;
      (4)   The financial impact that the residential building code may have on
the public's ability to purchase affordable housing.
   (b)   Extent of use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.

dangerous, unsafe or substandard, as defined in this Building Code and are
determined to be so after inspection by the Building Inspector, are hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and shall be abated by repair, rehabilitation,
demolition or removal in accordance with this Building Code. Such conditions

Inspector may be restored to a nondangerous, safe or standard building,

not in excess of fifty percent of the value at which said building stands on
the tax duplicate. No change of occupancy or use shall be compelled by reason
of such reconstruction or restoration. The cost of reconstruction, restoration
or repair shall be determined by the average estimates of the reconstruction,
restoration or repair made by three independent (from owner) contractors
registered with the City, acting in the capacity for which they are registered.
(Ord. 167-95. Passed 8-3-95; Ord. 129-01. Passed 6-21-01.)
1460.03 NOTICE AND ORDER.
   The Building Inspector shall issue a notice and order directed to the record
owner of the building. The notice and order shall contain the following:
   (a)   The street address and a legal description sufficient for
identification of the premises upon which the building is located.
   (b)   A statement that the Building Inspector has found the building to be
dangerous, unsafe or substandard, with a brief and concise description of the
conditions found to render the building dangerous, unsafe or substandard.
   (c)   A statement of the action required to be taken as determined by the
Building Inspector.
      (1)   If the Building Inspector has determined that the building must be
repaired, the order shall require that all required permits be secured therefor
and that the work be physically commenced within such time (not to exceed sixty
days from the date of the order) and completed within such time as the Building
Inspector shall determine is reasonable under all of the circumstances.
      (2)   If the Building Inspector has determined that the building must be
vacated, the order shall require that the building be vacated within a certain
time from the date of the order as determined by the Building Inspector to be
reasonable.
      (3)   If the Building Inspector has determined that the building must be
demolished, the order shall require that the building be vacated within such
time as the Building Inspector shall determine is reasonable (not to exceed
sixty days from the date of the order), that all required permits be secured
therefor within sixty days from the date of the order and that the demolition
be completed within such time as the Building Inspector shall determine is
reasonable.
   (d)   Statements advising that if any required repair or demolition work
(without vacation also being required) is not commenced within the time
specified, the Building Inspector will order the building vacated and posted to
prevent further occupancy until the work is completed, and may proceed to cause
the work to be done and charge the costs thereof against the property or its
owner.
   (e)   Statements advising that any person having any record title or a legal
interest in the building may appeal from the notice and order or any action of
the Building Inspector to the Board of Building Appeals, provided the appeal is
made in writing as provided in this Building Code, and filed with the Building
Inspector within thirty days from the date of service of such notice and order,
and further advising that failure to appeal will constitute a waiver of all
right to an administrative hearing and determination of the matter.
   (f)   The notice and order, and any amended or supplemental notice and
order, shall be served upon the record owner and posted on the property. One
copy thereof shall be served on each of the following if known to the Building
Inspector or disclosed from official public records: the holder of any mortgage
or deed of trust or other lien or encumbrance of record; the owner or holder of
any lease of record; and the holder of any other estate or legal interest of
record in or to the building or land on which it is located. The failure of the
Building Inspector to serve any person required herein to be served shall not
invalidate any proceedings hereunder as to any other person duly served or
relieve any such person from any duty or obligation imposed on him or her by
the provisions of this section.
   (g)   Service of the notice and order shall be made upon all persons
entitled thereto either personally or by mailing a copy of such notice and
order by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to each
such person at his or her address as it appears on the last tax roll of the
County or as known to the Building Inspector. If no address of any such person
so appears or is known to the Building Inspector, then a copy of the notice and
order shall be so mailed, addressed to such person at the address of the
building involved in the proceedings. The failure of any such person to receive
such notice shall not affect the validity of any proceedings taken under this
section. Service by certified mail in the manner herein provided shall be
effective on the date of mailing.
   (h)   Proof of service of the notice and order shall be certified to at the
time of service by written declaration under penalty of perjury executed by the
persons affecting service, declaring the time, date and manner in which service
was made. The declaration, together with any receipt card returned in
acknowledgement of receipt by certified mail, shall be affixed to the copy of
the notice and order retained by the Building Inspector.
   (i)   If compliance is not had with the order within the time specified
therein, and no appeal has been properly and timely filed, the Building
Inspector shall file in the office of the County Recorder a certificate
describing the property and certifying that the building is a dangerous, unsafe
or substandard building and that the owner has been so notified. Whenever the
corrections ordered shall thereafter have been completed or the building
demolished so that it no longer exists as a dangerous, unsafe or substandard
building on the property described in the certificate, the Building Inspector
shall file a new certificate with the County Recorder certifying that the
building has been demolished or all required corrections have been made, so
that the building is no longer dangerous, unsafe or substandard, whichever is
appropriate.
(Ord. 167-95. Passed 8-3-95.)
1460.04 STANDARDS DETERMINING REPAIR, VACATION AND DEMOLITION.
   The following standards shall be followed by the Building Inspector (and by
the Board of Building Appeals if an appeal is taken) in ordering the repair,
vacation or demolition of any dangerous, unsafe or substandard building:

1464.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HISTORIC DISTRICT REVIEW BOARD; COMPOSITION;
TERMS; GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   In recognition of the need for the establishment of a public body with the
authority to advise upon changes to structures and objects in the Historic
District in order to encourage changes that are compatible with the restoration
movement now in progress, the Historic District Review Board (hereinafter
referred to as the Review Board) is hereby established. The Review Board shall
consist of five taxpayers of the City appointed by the Mayor with approval of
City Council, for terms of three years. Initially, the terms shall be
staggered, with one appointment for three years, two appointments for two years
and two appointments for one year. At least two members of the Board shall be
business owners or property owners within the Historic District. In appointing
members, the Mayor and City Council shall make a good faith effort to appoint
persons with professional training in the fields of architecture, design, or
urban planning. The Building Inspector will be an ex officio member of the
Board without voting rights.
   (a)   Meetings. The Review Board shall hold monthly meetings. Meetings may
be waived if there is no agenda. However, the Review Board shall hold not less
than four regular meetings per year. All meetings must comply with the open
meeting laws of the State of Ohio.
   (b)   Quorum. Three members of the Board shall constitute a quorum. The
concurring vote of three members shall be necessary to adopt any motion or
action.
   (c)   Procedure. The Historic District Review Board shall adopt its own
procedural rules and guidelines with the approval of City Council.
(Ord. 192-97. Passed 9-4-97.)
1464.04 PURPOSE OF THE HISTORIC DISTRICT REVIEW BOARD.
   Council, being mindful of the proud history of this community, hereby
declares as a matter of public policy that the preservation, restoration,
rehabilitation and overall aesthetic improvement of our community are matters
of public necessity involving the health, safety, prosperity and welfare of the
people. The purpose of the Review Board is to:
   (a)   Maintain and enhance the distinctive character of the Historic
District by safeguarding the architectural integrity of the various period
structures within it, and to prevent intrusions and alterations within this
District that would be incompatible with this established character.
   (b)   Maintain and enhance the distinctive character of certain properties
in the City by safeguarding the architectural integrity of the various period
structures upon those properties in the Historic District.
   (c)   Provide for a means of design review for other aspects of community
development within the City that will be of any assistance in achieving a more
pleasing environment for the residents of and visitors to the City of London.
(Ord. 192-97. Passed 9-4-97.)
1464.05 DUTIES OF THE HISTORIC DISTRICT REVIEW BOARD.
   (a)   Following their appointment to the Review Board, members shall meet as
soon as possible to organize and elect a chairperson and secretary and shall be
reorganized annually. The Review Board shall adopt its own rules of procedure
and provide for regular and special meetings to accomplish the purposes of this
chapter. The Board may not adopt substantive rules or criteria without prior
City Council approval.
   (b)   The Review Board shall review and act upon all applications for
certificates of appropriateness, as required.
   (c)   The Review Board shall conduct or cause to be conducted, or assist in
the conducting of, a continuing survey of all areas, places, buildings,
structures, homes, works of art or other objects of environmental and aesthetic
interest in the City which the Board, on the basis of information available or
presented to it, has reason to believe are or will be eligible for designation
in the Historic District.
   (d)   The Review Board shall work for the continuing education of the
residents of the City with respect to the architectural and historic heritage
of the City and the Historic District designated under the provisions of this
chapter, and shall make every effort to improve the overall design and the
environmental awareness of the people.
   (e)   The Review Board shall establish criteria, rules, and regulations not
otherwise included in this chapter for evaluating applications for certificates
of appropriateness submitted to it and the manner in which they shall be
processed. These criteria shall include specific considerations to be given to
building material, landscaping, signs, lighting, color, appurtenances, and
architectural style for properties within the Historic District and properties
adjacent to the Historic District.
   (f)   The Review Board may recommend to City Council legislation that would
best serve to beautify, preserve, restore, and develop the City.
   (g)   The Review Board may employ on a part-time basis technical experts as
needed to assist in the performance of its duties, within the appropriations
made available.
   (h)   The Review Board may, within its capabilities, perform such other
related tasks as may be required and requested by City Council.
(Ord. 192-97. Passed 9-4-97.)
1464.06 BOUNDARIES OF THE HISTORIC DISTRICT.
   (a)   The existing Historic District boundaries are shown on the maps
attached to original Ordinance 192-97, passed September 4, 1997, as Exhibit A,
and incorporated herein by reference. The Historic District includes all
properties within such boundaries and all properties fronting on the opposite
side of the street or adjacent to any property within the Historic District,
listed in the National Register of Historic Places by the United States
Department of the Interior, and any amendments thereto.
   (b)   Property fronting on the opposite side of the boundary street or
adjacent to any property within the Historic District shall only be reviewed
and regulated to such a degree as to be reasonably compatible with those
properties within the Historic District boundary.
(Ord. 192-97. Passed 9-4-97.)
1464.07 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS REQUIRED.
   No building permit or sign permit required by the City of London shall be
issued in the Historic District for any construction, rehabilitation,
alteration, demolition, or relocation of any structure unless a certificate of
appropriateness has been issued. When the owner of a property within the
Historic District desires to make changes other than ordinary maintenance, such
owner, or his or her agent, shall first secure a certificate of
appropriateness.
(Ord. 192-97. Passed 9-4-97.)
1464.08 PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING A CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   The application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be made on
forms prescribed by the Building Inspector, along with such plans, drawings,
specifications, and other materials as may be needed by the Review Board to
make a determination. At a minimum, such information shall include the
following:
      (1)   A site plan showing building outlines, dimensions and landscaping.
      (2)   A complete description of the proposed change.
   (b)   Applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall be filed with
the Building Inspector at least ten days prior to the meeting of the Review
Board.
   (c)   The Review Board shall determine whether the proposed change will be
appropriate to the preservation of the environmental, architectural, or
historical character of the Historic District, pursuant to the criteria
specified in Sections
1464.09 and
1464.10.
   (d)   If the proposed change is in accordance with the guidelines and
criteria for the Review Board, then the Review Board shall issue a certificate
of appropriateness signed by no less than three Review Board members.
(Ord. 192-97. Passed 9-4-97.)
1464.09 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION OF APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE OF
APPROPRIATENESS.
   In considering the appropriateness of any proposed change, including changes
to facades, landscaping, exterior signing, awnings, or appurtenances, the
Review Board shall consider the following:
   (a)   All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance inconsistent with or inappropriate to the original
integrity of the building shall be discouraged.
   (b)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a historic
building, structure, site and/or its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural or
environmental feature should be avoided when possible.
   (c)   Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be
done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed
in the future, the essential form and integrity of the original structure would
be unimpaired.
   (d)   Whereas changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and
its environment, if these changes are deemed to have acquired significance,
then this significance shall be recognized and respected.
   (e)   Significant architectural features which have deteriorated shall be
repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced (if
historically correct) in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual
qualities. Repair or placement of architectural features should be based on
accurate duplication of the feature, and if possible, substantiated by
historic, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or
the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or
structures.
   (f)   The visual and functional components of the building and
appurtenances, and their site, including, but not limited to, building height,
massing and proportion, roof shape and slope, landscape design and plant
materials, lighting, vehicular and pedestrian circulation, and signing, shall
be taken into consideration.
   (g)   Distinctive stylistic features of examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated sensitively.
   (h)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of
the property, neighborhood, or environment.
   (i)   The surface cleaning of masonry structures shall be undertaken with
methods designed to minimize damage to historic building materials.
Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building
materials should be avoided.
   (j)   Attention shall be taken to avoid the environmentally harmful effect
often created by the clash of undisguised contemporary materials with those of
older origin, such as aluminum or other metals, plastic, glass, and fiberglass
used improperly with brick, stone, wood, and masonry.
(Ord. 192-97. Passed 9-4-97.)
1464.10 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   In considering an area, building, structure or work of art in the Historic
District, the following criteria shall apply:
   (a)   Existing Structures, Buildings and Open Areas. Reconstruction and/or
rehabilitation of structures within the Historic District shall conform to the
distinguishing, original exterior qualities or character of the structure, its
site, and its environment. The following elements shall also be considered:
      (1)   The character or value of a property or area as part of the
heritage or cultural characteristic of the City of London;
      (2)   Whether the structure, building or open area is identified as the
work of an architect or notable builder whose work has influenced the
development of the City of London;
      (3)   Whether the structure, building or open area occupies a unique
location or possesses a physical characteristic that represents an established
feature of the Historic District;
      (4)   Whether the building, structure or open area occupies the site of a
significant historic event.
   (b)   New Construction. The design of new structures and additions to
existing structures, including new site improvements, shall take into account
the architectural style, general design, arrangement, texture, material, and
color of other structures and premises within the same location.
   (c)   Standards for Rehabilitation. The Secretary of the Interior's
Standards for Rehabilitation shall apply and are as follows:
      (1)   A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new
use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features,
spaces, and spatial relationships.
      (2)   The historic character of a property will be retained and
preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features,
spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property will be avoided.
      (3)   Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties,
will not be undertaken.
      (4)   Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in
their own right will be retained and preserved.
      (5)   Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction
techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be
preserved.
      (6)   Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color,
texture, and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features will
be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence.
      (7)   Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken
using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic
materials will not be used.
      (8)   Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place.
If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken.
      (9)   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
will not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old
and will be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and
proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its
environment.
      (10)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction will be
undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
   (d)   Materials. All new structures and all reconstruction or remodeling of
existing structures within the Historic District shall utilize natural
traditional exterior materials such as brick, stone, masonry and wood. The use
of contemporary materials, such as aluminum, other metals, fiberglass, and
plastics for exterior surfaces on architecturally significant structures shall
be prohibited unless the use of such materials would contribute to the
preservation or enhancement of existing traditional materials and the overall
integrity and longevity of a structure.
   (e)   Color.
      (1)   Traditional colors that are identified with the origin or the era
in which the structure or property was originally built shall be used for
exteriors for all new structures to be built, and the reconstruction,
remodeling and exterior maintenance of existing structures within the Historic
District.
      (2)   The Historic Review Board has the authority to adopt color pallets
issued by manufacturers known as "historic colors". Once a color sheet has been
adopted by the Board, the building inspector, upon application and submission
of a color diagram or rendition and payment of all fees, may issue a
certificate of appropriateness for the use of any approved colors as submitted
in the application. The purpose of this is to avoid the necessity of an
individual owner or occupant coming before the Board for the purpose of a
change of color, as long as the change is a true historical color as approved
by the Board. If the inspector feels the colors are not appropriate, he or she
may submit the request to the Board for further action.
   (f)   Signs. All signs within the Historic District shall conform to the
color and material standards of this section, be of a style, size, and/or
design that reflects what is typically associated with the era during which the
structure was built. Such signs shall also conform to the requirements in other

of public necessity involving the health, safety, prosperity and welfare of the
people. The purpose of the Review Board is to:
   (a)   Maintain and enhance the distinctive character of the Historic
District by safeguarding the architectural integrity of the various period
structures within it, and to prevent intrusions and alterations within this
District that would be incompatible with this established character.
   (b)   Maintain and enhance the distinctive character of certain properties
in the City by safeguarding the architectural integrity of the various period
structures upon those properties in the Historic District.
   (c)   Provide for a means of design review for other aspects of community
development within the City that will be of any assistance in achieving a more
pleasing environment for the residents of and visitors to the City of London.
(Ord. 192-97. Passed 9-4-97.)
1464.05 DUTIES OF THE HISTORIC DISTRICT REVIEW BOARD.
   (a)   Following their appointment to the Review Board, members shall meet as
soon as possible to organize and elect a chairperson and secretary and shall be
reorganized annually. The Review Board shall adopt its own rules of procedure
and provide for regular and special meetings to accomplish the purposes of this
chapter. The Board may not adopt substantive rules or criteria without prior
City Council approval.
   (b)   The Review Board shall review and act upon all applications for
certificates of appropriateness, as required.
   (c)   The Review Board shall conduct or cause to be conducted, or assist in
the conducting of, a continuing survey of all areas, places, buildings,
structures, homes, works of art or other objects of environmental and aesthetic
interest in the City which the Board, on the basis of information available or
presented to it, has reason to believe are or will be eligible for designation
in the Historic District.
   (d)   The Review Board shall work for the continuing education of the
residents of the City with respect to the architectural and historic heritage
of the City and the Historic District designated under the provisions of this
chapter, and shall make every effort to improve the overall design and the
environmental awareness of the people.
   (e)   The Review Board shall establish criteria, rules, and regulations not
otherwise included in this chapter for evaluating applications for certificates
of appropriateness submitted to it and the manner in which they shall be
processed. These criteria shall include specific considerations to be given to
building material, landscaping, signs, lighting, color, appurtenances, and
architectural style for properties within the Historic District and properties
adjacent to the Historic District.
   (f)   The Review Board may recommend to City Council legislation that would
best serve to beautify, preserve, restore, and develop the City.
   (g)   The Review Board may employ on a part-time basis technical experts as

   (a)   The existing Historic District boundaries are shown on the maps
attached to original Ordinance 192-97, passed September 4, 1997, as Exhibit A,
and incorporated herein by reference. The Historic District includes all
properties within such boundaries and all properties fronting on the opposite
side of the street or adjacent to any property within the Historic District,
listed in the National Register of Historic Places by the United States
Department of the Interior, and any amendments thereto.
   (b)   Property fronting on the opposite side of the boundary street or
adjacent to any property within the Historic District shall only be reviewed
and regulated to such degree as to be reasonably compatible with those
properties within the Historic District boundary.
(Ord. 192-97. Passed 9-4-97.)
1464.07 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS REQUIRED.
   No building permit or sign permit required by the City of London shall be
issued in the Historic District for any construction, rehabilitation,
alteration, demolition, or relocation of any structure unless a certificate of
appropriateness has been issued. When the owner of a property within the
Historic District desires to make changes other than ordinary maintenance, such
owner, or his or her agent, shall first secure a certificate of
appropriateness.
(Ord. 192-97. Passed 9-4-97.)
1464.08 PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING A CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   The application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be made on
forms prescribed by the Building Inspector, along with such plans, drawings,
specifications, and other materials as may be needed by the Review Board to
make a determination. At a minimum, such information shall include the
following:
      (1)   A site plan showing building outlines, dimensions and landscaping.
      (2)   A complete description of the proposed change.
   (b)   Applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall be filed with
the Building Inspector at least ten days prior to the meeting of the Review
Board.
   (c)   The Review Board shall determine whether the proposed change will be
appropriate to the preservation of the environmental, architectural, or
historical character of the Historic District, pursuant to the criteria
specified in Sections
1464.09 and
1464.10.
   (d)   If the proposed change is in accordance with the guidelines and
criteria for the Review Board, then the Review Board shall issue a certificate
of appropriateness signed by no less than three Review Board members.
(Ord. 192-97. Passed 9-4-97.)
1464.09 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION OF APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE OF
APPROPRIATENESS.
   In considering the appropriateness of any proposed change, including change
to facades, landscaping, exterior signing, awnings, or appurtenances, the
Review Board shall consider the following:
   (a)   All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance inconsistent with, or inappropriate to the
original integrity of the building shall be discouraged.
   (b)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a historic
building, structure, site and/or its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural or
environmental feature should be avoided when possible.
   (c)   Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be
done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed
in the future, the essential form and integrity of the original structure would
be unimpaired.
   (d)   Whereas changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and
its environment, if these changes are deemed to have acquired significance then
this significance shall be recognized and respected.
   (e)   Significant architectural features which have deteriorated shall be
repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced (if
historically correct) in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual
qualities. Repair or placement of architectural features should be based on
accurate duplication of the feature, and if possible, substantiated by
historic, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or
the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or
structures.
   (f)   The visual and functional components of the building and
appurtenances, and their site, including, but not limited to, building height,
massing and proportion, roof shape and slope, landscape design and plant
materials, lighting, vehicular and pedestrian circulation, and signing, shall
be taken into consideration.
   (g)   Distinctive stylistic features of examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated sensitively.
   (h)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of
the property, neighborhood, or environment.
   (i)   The surface cleaning of masonry structures shall be undertaken with
methods designed to minimize damage to historic building materials.
Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building
materials should be avoided.
   (j)   Attention shall be taken to avoid the environmentally harmful effect
often created by the clash of undisguised contemporary materials with those of
older origin, such as aluminum or other metals, plastic, glass, and fiberglass
used improperly with brick, stone, wood, and masonry.
(Ord. 192-97. Passed 9-4-97.)
1464.10 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   In considering an area building, structure or work of art in the Historic
District, the following criteria shall apply:
   (a)   Existing Structures, Buildings and Open Areas. Reconstruction and/or
rehabilitation of structures within the Historic District shall conform to the
distinguishing, original exterior qualities or character of the structure, its
site, and its environment. The following elements shall also be considered:
      (1)   The character or value of a property or area as part of the
heritage or cultural characteristic of the City of London;
      (2)   Whether the structure, building or open area is Identified as the
work of an architect or notable builder whose work has influenced the
development of the City of London;
      (3)   Whether the structure, building or open area occupies a unique
location or possesses a physical characteristic that represents an established
feature of the Historic District;
      (4)   Whether the building, structure or open area occupies the site of a
significant historic event.
   (b)   New Construction. The design of new structures and additions to
existing structures, including new site improvements, shall take into account
the architectural style, general design, arrangement, texture, material, and
color of other structures and premises within the same location.
   (c)   Standards for Rehabilitation. The Secretary of the Interior's
Standards for Rehabilitation shall apply and are as follows:
      (1)   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment.
      (2)   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or the alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
      (3)   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historic development, such
as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings,
shall not be undertaken.
      (4)   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
      (5)   Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques, or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property, shall be
preserved.
      (6)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or
pictorial evidence.
      (7)   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials, shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
      (8)   Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
      (9)   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features of the property to protect the
historic integrity of the property and its environment.
      (10)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
   (d)   Materials. All new structures and all reconstruction or remodeling of
existing structures within the Historic District shall utilize natural
traditional exterior materials such as brick, stone, masonry and wood. The use
of contemporary materials, such as aluminum, other metals, fiberglass, and
plastics for exterior surfaces on architecturally significant structures shall
be prohibited unless the use of such materials would contribute to the
preservation or enhancement of existing traditional materials and the overall
integrity and longevity of a structure.
   (e)   Color. Traditional colors that are identified with the origin or the
era in which the structure or property was originally built shall be used for
exteriors for all new structures to be built, and the reconstruction,
remodeling and exterior maintenance of existing structures within the Historic
District.
   (f)   Signs. All signs within the Historic District shall conform to the
color and material standards of this section, be of a style, size, and/or
design that reflects what is typically associated with the era during which the
structure was built. Such signs shall also conform to the requirements in other
sections of this chapter. The size and shape of signs shall also correspond to
the existing proportions of period structures, and signs shall not be permitted
to cover or close existing window and doorway openings or otherwise hide
important architectural features.
   (g)   Awnings. All awnings within the Historic District shall conform to the
color standards of this section.
(Ord. 192-97. Passed 9-4-97.)
1464.11 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS REQUIRED FOR SIGNS AND AWNINGS.
   A certificate of appropriateness is required to erect or place any sign,
awning, or appurtenance in the Historic District. This would also include the
changing or replacement of existing signs, awnings, or appurtenances.
(Ord. 192-97. Passed 9-4-97.)
1464.12 DEMOLITION OF STRUCTURES.
   No demolition of any property shall be undertaken prior to obtaining a
certificate of appropriateness. In cases where an applicant applies for a
certificate of appropriateness to demolish a structure within the Historic
District, the Review Board shall grant the demolition and issue a certificate
of appropriateness when at least one of the following conditions prevails:
   (a)   The structure contains no features of architectural and historic
significance to the character of the Historic District.
   (b)   There exists no reasonable economic use for the structure as it exists
or as it might be restored, and there exists no feasible and prudent
alternative to demolition.
   (c)   Deterioration has progressed to the point where it is not economically
feasible to restore the structure.
(Ord. 192-97. Passed 9-4-97.)
1464.13 APPEALS.

attempt to work with the owner/owners of property in the District to work out
an alternative plan that is acceptable to all parties.

work out an alternative plan, then the owner may appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals within ten days of the decision of the Review Board. The Board of
Zoning Appeals may modify, remand or reverse the decision. Said appeal shall be
filed with the Building Inspector.
(Ord. 192-97. Passed 9-4-97.)

1476.01 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the City of London Erosion,
Sediment and Stormwater Control Regulations, hereinafter referred to as "these
Regulations".
(Ord. 140-96. Passed 4-4-96.)
1476.02 CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.
   These Regulations are promulgated in accordance with and pursuant to the
legal authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Ohio, Article
XVIII, Section 3, whereby municipalities are granted legal authority to adopt
rules to abate soil erosion and water pollution by soil sediment.
(Ord. 140-96. Passed 4-4-96.)
1476.03   PURPOSES.
   (a)   These Regulations are adopted to establish feasible and economically
reasonable standards aimed at achieving a level of management and conservation
practices which will minimize erosion of the soil and degradation of the waters
of the State by soil sediment, caused by nonfarm earth-disturbing activities.
   (b)   These Regulations are also adopted for the following purposes, but are
not limited to such purposes:
      (1)   To permit development while keeping downstream flooding, erosion
and sedimentation at minimal levels.
      (2)   To reduce damage to receiving streams which may be caused by
increases in the quantity and/or rate of water discharged, and to reduce
impairment of their capacity which may be caused by sedimentation, other
pollutants or other hydrologic modifications.
      (3)   To establish a basis for the design of all storm drainage systems
which will preserve the rights and options of dominant and servient property
owners, help assure the long-term adequacy of storm and drainage systems, and
ensure that post-construction water quality meets or exceeds preconstruction
levels.
(Ord. 140-96. Passed 4-4-96.)
1476.04 APPLICATION OF CHAPTER.
   These Regulations shall apply to all nonfarm, earth-disturbing activities
performed on lands within the corporate limits of the City, except those
activities excluded in sections of the Ohio Revised Code, as follows:
   (a)   Strip mining operations regulated by Ohio R.C. 1513.01;
   (b)   Surface mining operations regulated by Ohio R.C. 1514.01;
   (c)   Public highways, transportation and drainage improvements or
maintenance thereof undertaken by a government agency or political subdivision,
provided that its standard erosion and sediment control policies have been
approved by the Safety-Service Director or his or her designee or the Chief of
the Ohio Division of Soil and Water Conservation and that the applicable
erosion, sediment and stormwater control policies are no less restrictive than
these Regulations. Stormwater permits, however, are required through the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency for these activities. These sites will also be
subject to inspections.
(Ord. 140-96. Passed 4-4-96.)
1476.05   DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   Neither submission of a plan under provisions of these Regulations nor
compliance with the provisions of these Regulations shall relieve any person
from responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by
law, nor impose any duty or liability upon the City or its agents for damage to
any person or property.
(Ord. 140-96. Passed 4-4-96.)

1476.07 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   No person shall cause or allow earth-disturbing activities on a development
area except in compliance with the criteria of Section
1476.08, the standards and specifications of Sections
1476.09 through
1476.20 and as follows
   (a)   When a proposed development area consists of one or more acres and
earth-disturbing activities are proposed for the whole area or any part
thereof, the owner of record shall develop an erosion, sediment and stormwater
control plan and submit the same for review of its adequacy. Such a plan shall
contain sufficient information, drawings and notes to describe how soil erosion
and off-site sedimentation will be kept to a minimum, both during and after
construction. No earth-disturbing activities shall commence prior to approval
of the erosion, sediment and stormwater control plan by the Safety-Service
Director with the advice of the Madison Soil and Water Conservation District.
   (b)   When a proposed development area involves less than one acres, it is
not necessary to submit an erosion, sediment and stormwater control plan.
However, the responsible person must comply with other provisions of these
Regulations. Submittal of specific information may be required to determine
compliance.
   (c)   The erosion, sediment and stormwater control plan shall be certified
by a professional engineer registered in the State of Ohio.
   (d)   All plans should be submitted to the Madison Soil and Water
Conservation District and the London Safety-Service Director.
   (e)   The Madison Soil and Water Conservation District shall be notified
seventy- two hours before the commencement of earth-disturbing activities.
However, in the event that activities are scheduled to begin on a Monday, the
Madison Soil and Water Conservation District office must be notified by 3:00
p.m. the preceding Thursday. The Madison Soil and Water Conservation District
shall also be notified when the project is completed.
   (f)   All improvements will be constructed in conformity with approved
plans. Those recommendations made on-site will be formalized in letter form,
and, in the event of necessity, the responsible party must adhere to the advice
of the individual making the inspection.
(Ord. 140-96. Passed 4-4-96; Ord. 145-23. Passed 4-6-23.)
1476.08 EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   Any person seeking approval to construct a single-family residence or
structure shall be exempted from having to prepare an erosion, sediment and
stormwater control plan, provided such person:
      (1)   Constructs upon one lot or parcel at a time, and there is no other
construction occurring simultaneously on land or property within 200 feet of
the proposed development site; and
      (2)   Does not disrupt, alter or expose more than 10,000 square feet (.23
acre) of the existing natural surface of the total development site at a time;
and
      (3)   Submits and follows a standard plan for controlling runoff erosion
and sediment impacts foreseeable to result during and from site development,
which plan is acceptable to the approving agency.
   (b)   Exemption under this section of any person for the preparation and
submission of an erosion, sediment and stormwater control plan does not,
however, exempt such person from complying with the other provisions of this
chapter. The approving agency may require the responsible person to submit
information deemed necessary to determine compliance.
(Ord. 140-96. Passed 4-4-96.)
1476.09   STABILIZATION OF DENUDED AREAS AND SOIL STOCKPILES.
   (a)   Permanent or temporary soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded
areas within seven days after final grade is reached on any portion of the
site. Any such area which will not be regraded for longer than fifteen days
shall also be stabilized.
   Soil stabilization refers to measures which protect soil from the erosive
forces of raindrop impact and flowing water. Application practices include
vegetative establishment, mulching and the early application of gravel base on
areas to be paved. Soil stabilization measures should be selected to be
appropriate for the time of year, site conditions and estimated time of use.
   (b)   Soil stockpiles shall be stabilized or protected with sediment
trapping measures to prevent soil loss.
(Ord. 140-90. Passed 4-4-90.)
1476.10 ESTABLISHMENT OF PERMANENT VEGETATION.
   A permanent vegetative cover shall be established on denuded areas not
otherwise permanently stabilized. Permanent vegetation shall not be considered
established until ground cover is achieved which is mature enough to control
soil erosion satisfactorily and to survive severe weather conditions.
(Ord. 140-96. Passed 4-4-96.)
1476.11 PROTECTION OF ADJACENT PROPERTIES.
   Properties adjacent to the site of a land disturbance shall be protected
from sediment deposition. This may be accomplished by preserving a well-
vegetated buffer strip around the lower perimeter of the land disturbance, by
installing perimeter controls such as sediment barriers, filters or dikes, or
sediment basins, or by a combination of such measures.
   Vegetated filter strips may be used alone only where runoff in sheet flow is
expected. Filter strips should be at least fifteen feet in width. If at any
time it is found that a vegetated filter strip alone is ineffective in stopping
sediment movement onto adjacent property, additional perimeter controls shall
be provided.
(Ord. 140-96. Passed 4-4-96.)
1476.12 TIMING AND STABILIZATION OF SEDIMENT TRAPPING MEASURES.
   Sediment basins and traps, perimeter dikes, sediment barriers and other
measures intended to trap sediment on-site shall be constructed as a first step
in grading and be made functional before upslope land disturbance takes place.
Earthen structures such as dams, dikes and diversions shall be seeded and
mulched within fifteen days of completion of installation. These structures
will be inspected every seven days or within twenty-four hours of a rain event
greater than 0.5 inch and will be maintained until vegetative cover sufficient
enough to control erosion is established.
(Ord. 140-96. Passed 4-4-96.)
1476.13 SEDIMENT BASINS.
   Where five acres or more of the development area are disturbed in one
watershed, stormwater runoff from that watershed shall pass through a sediment
basin or other suitable sediment trapping facility with equivalent or greater
storage capacity. Sediment basins or traps may be required for smaller
disturbed areas if deemed necessary. The sediment basin requirement may also be
waived, by variance, if the approving agency agrees that site conditions do not
warrant its construction.
   Unless otherwise designed, sediment basins are temporary and shall be
removed following final stabilization of the site when vegetation is sufficient
enough to control erosion.
(Ord. 140-96. Passed 4-4-96.)
1476.14 CUT AND FILL SLOPES.
   Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and constructed in a manner which will
minimize erosion. Consideration should be given to the length and steepness of
the slope, the soil type, upslope drainage area, groundwater conditions and
other applicable factors. Slopes which are found to be eroding excessively
during the first year after construction shall be provided with additional
slope stabilizing measures by the developer until the problem is corrected. The
following guidelines are provided to aid in developing and adequate design:
   (a)   Roughened soil surfaces are generally preferred to smooth surfaces on
slopes.
         (b)   Diversions should be constructed at the top of long steep slopes
which have significant drainage areas above the slope. Diversions or terraces
may also be used to reduce slope length.
   (c)   Concentrated stormwater should not be allowed to flow down cut and
fill slopes unless contained within an adequate channel, flume or slope drain
structure.
   (d)   Wherever a slope face crosses a water seepage plane which endangers
the stability of the slope, adequate drainage or other protection should be
provided. A geotechnical engineer may be utilized to evaluate the site in
questionable situations.
(Ord. 140-96. Passed 4-4-96.)
1476.15 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT CRITERIA.
   (a)   General Requirements. All storm sewer designs shall be in accordance
with the following standards. All designs shall protect from flood damage and
inundation by storm water to any dwelling. Drainage water entering the
watershed shall be collected and routed from the area in approximately the same
location and manner that existed prior to the construction of the improvements.
Design of the drainage facilities within the drainage shed shall be such that
they will not divert drainage area from one watershed to another.
   (b)   Design of Drainage Facilities.
      (1)   Hydrologic design. All drainage ways shall be designed in
accordance with the following criteria:
         A.   Major waterways: Major waterways are defined as those with a
tributary area in excess of four square miles. Major waterways shall be
designed for an average recurrence interval of 100 years.
         B.   Secondary waterways: Secondary waterways are defined as those
with a tributary area of between one and four square miles. Secondary waterways
shall be designed for an average recurrence interval of fifty years.
         C.   Minor waterways: Minor waterways are defined as those with one
square mile or less of tributary area. Minor waterways shall be designed for an
average recurrence interval of twenty-five years for open channels and
culverts.
         D.   Roadway storm sewer networks: All roadway storm sewer shall be
designed for an average recurrence interval of ten years.
      (2)   Hydraulic design.
         A.   The design hydraulic grade line for any closed or open waterway,
bridges, or culverts shall be designed to contain the twenty-five-year rainfall
frequency within the proposed system. Storm sewers designed as part of a road
system with curb shall be designed so that the hydraulic grade line shall be no
higher than the inlet grates for a design discharge of the twenty-five-year
design (Q).
         B.   For all roadway design improvements or developments, catch basins
shall be so placed along the streets that the width or flow does not impede
traffic. For acceptable spread requirements along a roadway, reference Ohio
Department of Transportation Location and Design Volume 2, the most current
addition.
         C.   The depth of flow or ponding for a 100 year average recurrence
interval storm shall not exceed a level which would cause inundation or damage
to any dwelling constructed within the project area.
         D.   Site grading within the development shall be such that all lots
will readily drain. Lots shall have a 1.0% minimum slope in grass areas.
Overland flow on lots shall be limited to a maximum distance of 300 feet unless
approved by the City of London.
         E.   Bridges spanning open waterways shall have minimum freeboard
above water surface of two feet.
         F.   The minimum velocity for any closed or open conduit shall be two
and one-half feet per second under gravity flow conditions.
         G.   Building drainage facilities (sump lines, gutter collections, and
other related lines) construction shall run via underground conduits to the
main storm sewer facilities. Release of building drainage via overland flow is
prohibited without written approval by the City.
      (3)   Structural design. Catch basins, manholes, inlet structures, etc.,
placed within an improvement or development shall conform to standard plans on
file with the City. Structural design of all drainage facilities shall be
subject to the approval of the City of London.
         A.   Channels/swales: Minimum bottom width of constructed channels
shall be two feet. Each channel constructed shall have side slopes of 3:1 or
flatter.
         B.   All permanent drainage swales shall be shown on the construction
plans with easements on the final plat.
         C.   Maintenance of all drainage swales through a development shall be
the responsibility of the developer/owner. The developer/owner shall submit a
maintenance agreement to the City for approval. Once the maintenance agreement
is approved, an approved copy must be submitted to the City for their records.
         D.   Bank stabilization and stream bed stabilization, along
constructed or natural channels, will be required if the channel velocities are
sufficient to cause bank or invert erosion. The top of bank shall be so graded
that side drainage will enter channels only at points where structures are
provided to prevent bank erosion. Side drainage flow shall enter the channel as
nearly parallel with stream flow as possible. Earth channels shall be seeded or
sodded depending on the velocity of flow within the channel.
      (4)   Closed conduits.
         A.   All storm drainage within the development, which is capable of
being transmitted in a pipe seventy-two inches or less in diameter, shall be
carried in a closed conduit. At the request of the applicant and their design
engineer, this requirement may be waived. The reason for this waiver shall be
to meet the requirements of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency
Construction Permit. The minimal conduit size shall be twelve inch pipe.
         B.   Minimum clearance between top of pipe and top of surface shall be
two feet. All pipe with clearance less than two feet shall be reinforced
concrete pipe. The alignment of closed conduits shall be as nearly straight as
practicable without bends and angle points; manholes shall be provided at all
angle points and at intervals not to exceed 300 feet along the conduit unless
submitted for approval with proper documentation. Inverted siphons shall not be
permitted except for temporary structures.
         C.   All pipe, bedding, and backfill shall be designed in accordance
with the Ohio Department of Transportation design manual. Ditch protection
shall be required if the ten year flow velocities in a channel or waterway
exceed four feet per second for soil ditches or six feet per second in sodded
ditches. If the exit velocity from a storm sewer exceeds the allowable
velocities, an energy dissipating device (i.e. stilling basing, dumped rock)
may be necessary.
      (5)   Storm water runoff control criteria for retention/detention basins.
         A.   Any development which increases the runoff rate and volume shall
be required to control the discharge rate of runoff prior to its release to its
off-site outlet.
         B.   Any increase in the volume of site surface drainage water
resulting from accelerated runoff caused by site development shall be
controlled so that the post development peak discharge rate does not exceed
that of the pre-development peak discharge rate, for all twenty-four hour
storms between a one year frequency and the critical storm frequency as
determined below. The method by which an applicant shall determine changes in
rates and volumes of runoff is presented in the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Engineering Division of the Soil Conservation Service, Urban Hydrology for
Small Watersheds, Technical Release No. 55, June 1986 or most current edition.
To find the critical storm frequency for which additional control will be
needed, the applicant shall:
            1.   Determine the percent increase in runoff volume for a one year
frequency, twenty-four hour storm occurring on the development area.
            2.   Determine the critical storm frequency for which additional
control is needed by using the percent increase in runoff volume, derived in
Table 1.
            3.   Control the post development storms of a frequency between one
year and the critical storm determined in
Table 1, so as to be equal to or less than the pre-development peak runoff rate
for a twenty-four hour one year frequency storm.

         C.   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than
the critical storm up to the 100 year storm have peak runoff rates no greater
than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size storms under pre-development
conditions. Consideration of the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-,
and 100-year storms shall be considered adequate in designing and developing to
meet this standard.
   Critical Year Storm Calculation:
   (1 year Post – 1 Year Pre) x 100%
   (1 Year Pre)
         D.   Post construction runoff control. In order to:
            1.   Reduce increases in non-point pollution caused by storm water
runoff.
            2.   Minimize the total runoff volume which flows from a site
following increases in impervious area by development.
            3.   Minimize changes in the watershed hydrology inherent with
development.
         E.   The drainage design shall incorporate post construction storm
water management requirements.
            1.   The post construction requirements of the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency Construction Permit, OHC000005 shall be made part of these
regulations. The City of London shall be responsible for reviewing Part
III.G.2.e of the current permit. Please note, the current OHC000005 permit is
effective for five years. In subsequent OEPA Construction Permits or if the
current permit is revised, the applicable post construction parts of the
reissued or revised permit shall take precedence. Any revision in the plan need
to be reviewed by the City.
            2.   The site specific characteristics shall be considered in the
design.
               a.   Minimum office sizes should be considered in areas of soils
with low permeability rates.
               b.   Infiltration systems in sites over well field areas shall
require the approval of the Health Department.
   (c)   Drainage Plan. The development drainage map shall include sufficient
data for the City to check the feasibility of the drainage system as proposed
by the developer. The following data shall be provided:
      (1)   Hydrologic calculation. (At all critical points within the
development):
         A.   Tributary drainage areas delineated on the map.
         B.   Times of concentration.
         C.   Intensity.
         D.   Runoff coefficients.
         E.   Design flow.
      (2)   Hydraulic calculations.
         A.   Sufficient documentation to indicate the results of the
investigation into the adequacy of the downstream drainage system to handle the
runoff from the proposed development. This will determine the maximum allowable
release rate for the proposed development and, in turn, the amount or storm
water storage that will be required.
         B.   The plan and profile of all drainage ways shall be provided,
imposed upon which shall be the design energy and hydraulic grade lines.
         C.   Sizes and types of drainage improvements, including special
structures, typical sections, right-of-way width and fencing.
         D.   Supporting calculations for upstream and downstream channel
capacities as they affect overflow, erosion or backwater within the
development. Such calculations shall be substantiated by such additional
information as is required to determine profile and cross section of the
upstream and downstream channel reaches under consideration.
         E.   Sufficient contours and grading details to indicate proposed
street grades and elevations throughout the development.
   (d)   Construction Plans.
      (1)   The final construction plans for drainage within the development
shall conform to the above provisions and to any special conditions as required
by the City of London in approving the tentative map. Such construction plans
for drainage shall be approved by the City of London prior to construction of
any drainage facilities within the development. A grading plan with minimum
finish floor elevations shall be submitted along with the construction plans to
identify the lot grading and in-tract drainage planned for the development. The
final construction drawings shall contain the locations, widths, names of
existing streets, railroad rights-of-way, easements, parks, permanent
buildings, and corporation and township lines; location of wooded areas and
other significant topographic and natural features within and adjacent to the
development property for a minimum distance of 200 feet.

      (2)   The designer should investigate the capacity of the downstream
drainage facilities to determine if they will be adequate to handle the design
flow from this particular development. If the downstream facilities are
inadequate, it may be necessary to provide on-site detention or retention
basins to limit the flow to an amount which the downstream system can accept.
      (3)   A site grading plan with minimum finish shall be required by the
design engineer as a part of the construction plans. At a minimum, first floor
elevations should be shown. If minimum basement elevations are stated in the
plans, developer/owners must follow the plans or assume all risk.
      (4)   All plans, calculations, and design work needs to be signed off by
a professional engineer.
   (e)   Storm Water Runoff Policy.
      (1)   This design manual is based on the policy that land uses and
developments which increase the runoff rate or volume shall be required to
control the discharge rate of runoff prior to its release of off-site land. The
purposes of this policy are to:
         A.   Permit development without increasing the flooding of other
lands.
         B.   Reduce damage to receiving streams and impairment of their
capacity which may be caused by increases in the quantity and rate of water
discharged.
         C.   Establish a basis for design of a storm drainage system on lands
below undeveloped areas which will preserve the rights of property owners and
assure the long-term adequacy of storm drainage systems. This runoff control
policy applies to all land developments not specifically exempted below.
Exemptions are appropriate for certain land use activities which clearly do not
generate significant increases in storm water runoff. The following land uses
and developments are within this exemption category:
            1.   Land preparation for agricultural crops, orchards, woodlots,
sod farms and nursery operations.
            2.   Land grading or leveling for erosion control under direction
of the local soil conservation district.
   (f)   Proposed Guidelines for Detention Basins Statement or Purpose.
      (1)   As urban development continues to transform previous watersheds
into highly impervious urban areas, the problem of handling the ever increasing
storm water runoff on these watersheds is becoming more pronounced. In recent
years, much attention has been focused on detention basins as a means of
controlling the storm water runoff by detaining the water in the basin and
releasing it at a rate compatible with downstream conditions. Some basins have
a multi-purpose function, containing sport facilities, lakes and a park-like
atmosphere during dry periods. The recommendations presented in this report are
intended to serve this function. By following the recommendations, the
detention basin can be designed so as to obtain the maximum recreational
aesthetic benefits for the surrounding community while serving as an effective
flood control mechanism.
         A.   Planning guidelines.
            1.   Detention basins serve to capture and temporarily store the
surface water runoffs which result from urban development. This temporary
storage allows for the release of the storm runoff at discharge rates which are
acceptable to the receiving waterway. Onsite provision for detention storage
would follow these approaches:
               a.   The release rate and volume of detention storage would be
based on previously mentioned design requirements and standards.
               b.   Recreational uses should be maximized where possible and
feasible.
               c.   Any development which the drainage exits the corporation
limits of the City and enters onto county, township, or state jurisdiction
shall be reviewed by the appropriate government official.
               d.   Stormwater runoff of the pre-developed "sheet flow"
characteristics versus post-developed "point source" release of the stormwater
exiting the site shall be taken into design consideration. Provide downstream
energy dissipation.
               e.   Stormwater design shall take into consideration and provide
adequate drainage for neighboring upstream property surface or subsurface water
entering onto the proposed development or site.
               f.   Any storm tile found entering a proposed development or
found while excavating needs to be investigated and validated that it works. If
the storm tile is found to be in working condition, the storm tile must be
replaced.
         B.   Detention basins. The bottom of the basin shall have a minimum
slope of 1.0 percent.
         C.   Retention basins.
            1.   In order to provide for better management of the water,
retention basins shall have a permanent water area of at least one-half acre.
The permanent water area shall have a minimum average water depth of six feet
and no extensive shallow areas.
            2.   In excavated lakes, the underwater side slopes shall be
stable.
            3.   A two foot deep, five feet wide safety ledge is required
around the perimeter of the basin.
         D.   Detention and retention basins.
            1.   All developments/site improvements requiring detention/
retention shall have a homeowners association as a part of the plat
restrictions. The association shall be responsible for all pond and drainage
swale maintenance.
            2.   There shall be a minimum three foot wide berm at a two percent
slope between the right-of-way and the top of the basin slope.
            3.   Slopes on the sides of the basin shall have a maximum slope of
3 to 1. This includes both sides of any constructed levy.
            4.   The minimum diameter of any outlet conduit shall be one foot.
            5.   Safety measures shall be provided for any pipe or opening to
prevent children or large animals from crawling into structures.
            6.   Danger signs should be mounted at appropriate locations to
warn of deep water, possible flood conditions that exist during storm periods
and other dangers that exist.
            7.   Retention pond design and maintenance shall include algae
control with pond additives. Fountains shall also be considered but are
optional.
            8.   Grass or other suitable vegetative cover shall be maintained
throughout the entire basin area. Grass shall be cut regularly, no less than
five times a year by the homeowner association.
            9.   Debris, trash removal and other necessary maintenance shall be
performed after each storm to assure continued operation in conformance with
the design.
            10.   There shall be a minimum of one foot freeboard between the
100 year storm elevations and the top of the levy or embankment containing the
basin.
            11.   All basins shall have an emergency overflow.
            12.   The City shall be notified prior to any adjustments to the
approved outlet structure to any detention or retention basin. No adjustment
shall be made until approved by the City.
            13.   The surface area opening for catch basin inlets shall be
equal to or greater than the design overland flow contributing water to that
basin.
            14.   The site developer may pass on maintenance responsibilities
to the respective owner/homeowner's association via a maintenance agreement.
The maintenance agreement must be approved by the City and an approved copy
must be submitted to the City for their records.
         E.   " As-built" drawings will be required for all basins to assure
compliance with all applicable requirements. This requirement shall include
calculations to confirm that the basin and outlet were constructed to function
as designed.
            (Ord. 146-23. Passed 4-6-23.)
1476.16 STABILIZATION OF WATERWAYS AND OUTLETS.
   All on-site stormwater conveyance channels except roadway ditches shall be
designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity of flow from a ten-
year frequency storm without erosion. Stabilization adequate to prevent erosion
shall also be provided at; the outlet of all pipes and paved channels.
(Ord. 140-96. Passed 4-4-96.)
1476.17 STORM SEWER INLET PROTECTION.
   All storm sewer inlets which are made operable during construction shall be
protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter the conveyance system
without first being filtered or otherwise treated to remove sediment.
(Ord. 140-96. Passed 4-4-96.)
1476.18 WORKING IN OR CROSSING OF WATERCOURSES.
   (a)   Construction vehicles should be kept out of a watercourse to the
extent possible. Where in-channel work is necessary, precautions shall be taken
to stabilize the work area during construction to minimize corrosion. Tho
channel (including bed and banks) shall always be restabilized immediately
after in-channel work is completed.
   (b)   Where a live (wet) watercourse will be crossed by construction
vehicles regularly during construction, a temporary stream crossing shall be
provided.
(Ord. 140-96. Passed 4-4-96.)
1476.19 DISPOSITION OF TEMPORARY MEASURES.
   All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be disposed of
within thirty days after final site stabilization is achieved, as determined by
the Madison Soil and Water Conservation District or after temporary measures
are no longer needed, unless otherwise authorized by the Madison Soil and Water
Conservation District. Trapped sediment and other disturbed soil areas
resulting from the disposition of temporary measures shall be permanently
stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation.
(Ord. 140-96. Passed 4-4-96.)
1476.20 MAINTENANCE.
   All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices shall be
maintained and repaired as needed to assure continued performance of their
intended function. The developer will be responsible for such maintenance until
the final inspection by the Madison Soil and Water Conservation District. For
long-term maintenance, see Section
1476.25.

1478.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose and intent of this chapter are to provide a uniform and
comprehensive set of standards for the development and installation of
telecommunications and related facilities. The regulations contained herein are
designed to protect and promote public health, safety, community welfare and
the aesthetic quality of the City of London as set forth within the goals,
objectives and policies of the City of London Zoning Code, and to encourage
managed development of telecommunications infrastructure, while at the same
time not unduly restricting the development of needed telecommunications
facilities.
   It is intended that the City shall apply these regulations to accomplish the
following:
   (a)   Minimize adverse visual effects of telecommunications towers, antennas
and related facilities through design and siting standards.
   (b)   Maintain and ensure that a nondiscriminatory, competitive and broad
range of telecommunications services and high quality telecommunications
infrastructure consistent with the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 are
provided to serve the community, as well as to serve as an important and
effective part of the City of London's police, fire and emergency response
network.
   (c)   Provide a process for obtaining necessary permits for
telecommunications facilities while at the same time protecting the legitimate
interests of the residents of the City of London.
   (d)   Protect environmentally sensitive areas of the City of London by

   The Health Commissioner is hereby authorized and directed to make
inspections to determine the condition of dwellings, dwelling units, rooming
units and premises located within the City, in order that he or she may perform
his or her duty of safeguarding the health and safety of the occupants of
dwellings and of the general public. For the purpose of making such
inspections, the Commissioner is hereby authorized to request and obtain from a
court of competent jurisdiction an order authorizing him or her to enter,
examine and survey at all reasonable times all dwellings, dwelling units,
rooming units and premises. The owner or occupant of every dwelling, dwelling
unit and rooming unit, or the person in charge thereof, shall give the
Commissioner free access to such dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit and
its premises, at all reasonable times for the purpose of such inspection,
examination and survey. Every occupant of a dwelling or dwelling unit shall
give the owner thereof, or his or her agent or employee, access to any part of
such dwelling or dwelling unit, or its premises, at all reasonable times for
the purpose of making such repairs or alterations as are necessary to effect
compliance with the provisions of this Housing Code or with any lawful rule or
regulation adopted or any lawful order issued pursuant to the provisions
hereof.
(Ord. 1372. Passed 4-20-61.)
1482.02 ENFORCEMENT; SERVICE OF NOTICES AND ORDERS; HEARINGS.
   (a)   Whenever the Health Commissioner determines that there are reasonable
grounds to believe that there has been a violation of any provision of this
Housing Code or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant hereto, he or she
shall give notice of such alleged violation to the person or persons
responsible therefor, as hereinafter provided.
   Such notice shall:
      (1)   Be put in writing and signed by the Health Commissioner;
      (2)   Include a statement of the reasons why it is being issued;
      (3)   Allow a reasonable time for the performance of any act it requires;
      (4)   Be served upon the owner or his or her agent, or the occupant, as
the case may require, provided that such notice shall be deemed to be properly
served upon such owner or agent, or upon such occupant, if a copy thereof is
served upon him or her personally, or sent by registered mail to his or her
last known address, or posted in a conspicuous place in or about the dwelling
affected by the notice, or if he or she is served with such notice by any other
method authorized or required under the laws of this State;
      (5)   A copy of such notice showing the time and manner of service shall
be kept on file by the Commissioner. Such notice may contain an outline of
remedial action which, if taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of
this Housing Code and with rules and regulations adopted pursuant hereto.
   (b)   Any person affected by any notice which has been issued in connection
with the enforcement of any provision of this Housing Code, or of any rule or
regulation adopted pursuant hereto, may request and shall be granted a hearing
on the matter before the Health Commissioner, provided that such person shall
file in the office of the Commissioner a written petition requesting such
hearing and setting forth a brief statement of the grounds therefor within ten
days after the day the notice was served. Upon receipt of such petition, the
Commissioner and/or his or her counselor shall set a time and place for such
hearing and shall give the petitioner written notice thereof. At such hearing
the petitioner shall be given an opportunity to be heard and to show why such
notice shall be modified or withdrawn. The hearing shall be commenced not later
than ten days after the day on which the petition was filed, provided, however,
that upon application of the petitioner, the Commissioner may postpone the date
of the hearing for a reasonable time beyond such ten-day period, if in his or
her judgment the petitioner has submitted a good and sufficient reason for such
postponement.
   (c)   After such hearing the Health Commissioner shall sustain, modify or
withdraw the notice, depending upon his or her finding as to whether the
provisions of this Housing Code and of the rules and regulations adopted
pursuant hereto have been complied with. If the Commissioner sustains or
modifies such notice, it shall be deemed to be an order. Any notice served
pursuant to subsection (a) hereof shall automatically become an order if a
written petition for a hearing is not filed in the office of the Commissioner
within ten days after such notice is served. After a hearing in the case of a
notice suspending any permit required by this Housing Code or by any rule or
regulation adopted pursuant hereto, when such notice has been sustained by the
Commissioner, the permit shall be deemed to have been revoked. Any such permit
which has been suspended by a notice shall be deemed to be automatically
revoked if a petition for a hearing is not filed in the office of the
Commissioner within ten days after such notice is served.
   (d)   The proceedings at such hearing, including the findings and decision
of the Health Commissioner, shall be summarized, reduced to writing and entered
as a matter of public record in the office of the Commissioner. Such record
shall also include a copy of every notice or order issued in connection with
the matter. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Commissioner may seek
relief therefrom in any court of competent jurisdiction as provided by the laws
of this State.
   (e)   Whenever the Health Commissioner finds that an emergency exists which
requires immediate action to protect the public health, he or she may, without
notice or hearing, issue an order reciting the existence of such an emergency
and requiring that such action be taken as he or she deems necessary to meet
the emergency. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Housing Code, such
order shall be effective immediately. Any person to whom such order is directed
shall comply therewith immediately, but, upon petition to the Commissioner,
shall be afforded a hearing as soon as possible. After such hearing, depending
upon his or her finding as to whether the provisions of this Housing Code and
the rules and regulations adopted pursuant hereto have been complied with, the
Commissioner shall continue such order in effect, modify it or revoke it.
(Ord. 1372. Passed 4-20-61.)

has been held pursuant to thirty days notice in a newspaper of general
circulation in Madison County, to adopt such rules and regulations as may be
necessary for the proper enforcement of the provisions of this Housing Code,
provided that such rules and regulations shall not be in conflict with the
provisions of this Housing Code. The Board of Health shall file a certified
copy of all rules and regulations which it may adopt with the Clerk of Council.
Such rules and regulations shall have the same force and effect as the
provisions of this Housing Code, and the penalty for violation thereof shall be
the same as the penalty for violation of the provisions of this Housing Code,
