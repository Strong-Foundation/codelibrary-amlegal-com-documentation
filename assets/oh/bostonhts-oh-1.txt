VILLAGE OF BOSTON HEIGHTS, OHIO; TO REPEAL ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH;
AND TO PUBLISH THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER HEREIN.
   WHEREAS, the Council of the Village of Boston Heights, Ohio, has had the
matter of recodification and general revision of the ordinances before it for
some time; and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such recodification; and
   WHEREAS, the recodification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council;
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the Village of Boston
Heights, State of Ohio:
Section 1: That the ordinances of the Village of Boston Heights, Ohio, of a
general and permanent nature, as revised, recodified, rearranged and
consolidated into component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby
approved, adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Boston Heights,
Ohio, 1988.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Village Clerk, attached to this ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the Village of Boston Heights,
Ohio.
Section 2: That the provisions of this ordinance, including all provisions of
the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 4 of this ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to February 16, 1988, which are inconsistent with any provision
of the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of
this ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege;
      (2)   The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property;
      (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment;
      (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation;
      (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness;
      (6)   The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges;
      (7)   The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any street or

shall post copies of the Codified Ordinances along with a copy of this
ordinance in the five public places as provided by Section
123.01 of the Codified Ordinances. All sections of the Codified Ordinances
without a previous ordinance or resolution history at the end thereof indicate
that the sections contain new matter ordained by this adopting ordinance.
 
Section 4: That this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety, and for
the further reason that there exists an imperative necessity for the earliest
publication and distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and
residents of the Village, so as to facilitate administration, daily operation
and avoid practical and legal entanglements. Wherefore, this ordinance shall
take effect from and after its passage.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
 
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
 
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
 
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:

liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
 
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
 
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

   133.06  PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY.
    The Village of Boston Heights believes that openness leads to a better
informed citizenry, which leads to better government and better public policy.
It is the policy of the Village of Boston Heights to strictly adhere to the
state's Public Records Act. All exemptions to openness are to be construed in
their narrowest sense and any denial of public records in response to a valid
request must be accompanied by an explanation, including legal authority, as
outlined in the Ohio Revised Code. If the request is in writing the explanation
must also be in writing.
   (a)   Public Records. This office, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code,
defines records as including the following: Any documents - paper, electronic
(including, but not limited to, e-mail), or other format - that is created or
received by, or comes under the jurisdiction of a public office that documents
the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or
other activities of the office. All records of the Village of Boston Heights
are public unless they are specifically exempt from disclosure under the Ohio
Revised Code.
      (1)   It is the policy of the Village of Boston Heights that, as required
by Ohio law, records will be organized and maintained so that they are readily
available for inspection and copying (See subsection (d) hereof for the e- mail
record policy.) Record retention schedules are to be updated regularly and
posted prominently.
   (b)   Records Requests. Each request for public records should be evaluated
for a response using the following guidelines.
      (1)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the pubic office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian must contact
the requester for clarification, and should assist the requestor in revising
the request by informing the requestor of the manner in which the office keeps
its records.
      (2)    The requestor does not have to put a records request in writing,
and does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record. It is this office's general policy that this
information is not to be requested.
      (3)    Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours, with the exception of published holidays. Public records must
be made available for inspection promptly. Copies of public records must be
made available within a reasonable period of time. "Prompt" and "reasonable"
take into account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the
location where the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review
of the records requested. The Fiscal Officer shall provide the requester,
within three days of submitting a request, a response to said inquiry.
      (4)    Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests include, but are not limited
to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), budgets, salary
information, forms and applications, personnel rosters, etc. If fewer than 20
pages of copies are requested or if the records are readily available in an
electronic format that can be e-mailed or downloaded easily, these should be
made as quickly as the equipment allows. If more copies are requested, an
appointment should be made with the requester on when the copies or computer
files can be picked up. All requests for public records may either be satisfied
or acknowledged in writing by the Village of Boston Heights within three
business days following the office's receipt of the request. A response may
include the information requested, clarification if there is ambiguity in the
request, a statement that such information is not available, or notification
that a request is significantly beyond "routine."
      (5)    If a request is deemed significantly beyond "routine," such as
seeking a voluminous number of copies or requiring extensive research, the
acknowledgment must include the following:
         A.   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request.
         B.    An estimated cost if copies are requested.
         C.    Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure.
         D.    Any denial of public records requested must include an
explanation, including legal authority. If portions of a record are public and
portions are exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest
released. If there are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a
supporting explanation, including legal authority.
   (c)   Cost of Public Records. All public records, whether digital or in
print, shall be provided to the requester at actual cost and shall not include
any labor costs. The Village of Boston Heights reserves the right to charge in
advance and to pass on actual costs to the requester whenever such costs exist.
      (1)    Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. They will be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies.
   (d)   E-mail. Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by
the Ohio Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the Village
of Boston Heights. E-mail is to be treated in the same fashion as records in
other formats and should follow the same retention schedules.
      (1)   Records in private e-mail accounts used to conduct public business
are subject to disclosure, and all employees or representative of the Village
of Boston Heights are instructed to retain their e-mails that relate to public
business (See subsection (a) Public Records) and to copy them to their business
e-mail account and/or to the office's records custodian.
      (2)    The record custodian is to treat the e-mails from private accounts
as records of the public office, filing them in the appropriate way, retaining
them per established schedules and making them available for inspection and
copy in accordance with the Public Records Act.
   (e)   Failure to Respond to a Public Records Request. The Village of Boston
Heights recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of failure to properly
respond to a public records request. In addition to the distrust in government
that failure to comply may cause, the Village of Boston Heights failure to
comply with a request may result in a court ordering the Village of Boston
Heights to comply with the law and to pay the requester attorney's fees and
damages.

(Ord. 2023-8-22. Passed 8-22-23.)
141.05 MAILBOX REPLACEMENT POLICY.
   (a)   Purpose and Intent. The intent of this policy is to establish a
uniform process to replace or reimburse residents for damage to mailboxes due
to snow removal operations. The Village’s primary obligation is to ensure that
its roadways are as clear as possible of snow or ice. It is also understood
that most mailboxes are located within the public right of way, and therefore
while fulfilling the primary objective, mailboxes may be unintentionally and
unavoidably damaged. This policy assumes there is a shared responsibility
between the Village and the homeowner when mailboxes located in the public
right of way are damaged during snow removal operations.
   While there is no legal requirement for the Village to replace these
mailboxes, it is the practice of the Village to do so. The purpose of this
policy is to outline the circumstances which the Village will replace private
mailboxes or reimburse owners who wish to install different and/or more
expensive replacements than the Village will provide.
   (b)   Determination of Reimbursement. In the event that the Village receives
any requests for mailbox replacement due to snow plowing damage or destruction,
the Village, in its sole discretion, shall determine whether Village operations
caused the circumstances which necessitate replacement of the mailbox.
   (c)   Eligibility for Reimbursement. In order for a damaged mailbox to be
eligible for replacement or reimbursement, the following conditions must be
met:
      (1)   The damaged mailbox and/or post must meet the requirements of the
U.S. Postal Service in regard to construction and location.
      (2)   The damage must have been caused by direct contact with Village
equipment. The Village will not repair or replace mailboxes or posts damaged
solely by snow thrown by Village plowing or removal equipment.
      (3)   The property owner must notify the Village within seven days of the
date the damage occurred. Unless the property owner/tenant/ or individual
responsible for the property was out of town, the damage must be reported to
the Village within seven days of that individual’s return.
      (4)   The “Mailbox & Post Damage Notification” Form must be completed and
signed by the resident filing the claim and subsequently approved by the Road
Department Superintendent.
   (d)   Procedure.
      (1)   Reimbursement Procedure. In the event that a mailbox and/or its
support post is damaged or destroyed by direct contact with Village equipment
engaged in snow plowing or snow removal operations and satisfies the other
criteria noted above, the Village will offer the owner of the property the
choice of one of the following options:
         A.   The Village will furnish and install a standard replacement post
and/or mailbox selected by the Village. Standard mailbox replacement includes
light sheet metal or plastic construction mailboxes conforming to the
requirements of the U.S. Postal Service. The standard post will be a 4x4
treated wood post.
         B.   Where a more expensive decorative mailbox/post is involved, or
where the property owner simply wants to erect a different mailbox than the
mailbox offered by the Village, the Village will offer the property owner the
option of reimbursement in an amount equal to the actual cost of the mailbox
erected by the property owner, or cost of the standard post and/or mailbox
offered by the Village, whichever is less. The resident shall be responsible
for demonstrating the costs of replacement to the Village’s satisfaction. The
current Village mailbox cost is fifty dollars ($50.00). The replacement mailbox
and post must be in compliance with the United States Postal Regulations.
      (2)   Road Department Responsibilities.
         A.   The Road Department Superintendent shall review the established
reimbursement to be provided in accordance with the policy above. This
reimbursement amount shall be based on the actual cost to the Village of a
standard post and/or mailbox.
         B.   The Road Department shall install a new box and/or post for all
eligible residents requesting and approved for same. Where this work cannot be
performed within seven days for any reason, including but not limited to frozen
ground, the Department shall either make temporary repairs or provide a
temporary mailbox installation sufficient to allow the postal service to resume
mail delivery.
         C.   Where reimbursement has been requested for a different or more
expensive decorative mailbox, and the presence of frozen ground or other
factors make installation impractical, the Road Department shall also install a
temporary box and/or post as outlined above.
         D.   The Road Department Superintendent shall periodically review this
policy and, when necessary, recommend changes or revisions to the Village
Council.
            (Ord. 2019-3-5. Passed 5-14-19.)

147.18  SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION POLICY.
   (a)   Legally Prescribed Drugs and Non-Prescription Medications.  The

report such use to the Mayor or the Mayor's designee. Certification from a
medical doctor that an employee is able to perform the normal functions of
their position may be required before the employee will be allowed to continue
working. This requirement includes medical marijuana that has been recommended

dispensary in accordance with the requirements of the Ohio Revised Code and any

      (1)    Medical marijuana.
         A.    Any Village employee who is using medical marijuana shall report

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171.    Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
      In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipalty and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is
set forth in Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's ourt shall
make a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.
171.01   Duties; jurisdiction.
171.02   Minimum refund for overpayment of waivered traffic tickets.

181.01 PURPOSE, RATE AND IMPOSITION.
   (a)   It is hereby deemed necessary to the health, safety and general
welfare of the residents of the Municipality that a tax be levied upon all
rents received by a hotel or transient accommodations for lodging and display
or sample rooms at the rate of three percent (3%) of such total of the rents
charged.
(Ord. 35-1970. Passed 8-12-70.)
 
   (b)   For the purpose of providing revenue for which to meet the needs of
the Municipality for the use of the permanent improvement fund and the general
fund of the Municipality, an excise tax is hereby levied on transactions by
which lodging by a hotel or other transient accommodation is or is to be
furnished to transient guests. The three percent (3%) tax is effective on and
after September 1, 1970. The tax is three percent (3%) of the amount paid or to
be paid by the transient guest for the lodging. The tax applies and is
collectable at the time the lodging is furnished, regardless of the time when
the payment for lodging is made.
(Ord. 35-1976. Passed 9-8-76.)
 
   (c)   For the purpose of the proper administration of the provisions of this
chapter, and to prevent the evasion of the tax it is presumed that all lodging
furnished by hotels or other transient accommodations in the Municipality to

deduct, at the time of payment of such salary, wages, commissions, or other
compensation, the tax of two percent (2%) per year of the gross salaries,
wages, commissions, or other compensation due by such employer to such
employee, and shall on or before the last day of each month, make a return and
pay to the Administrator the amount of taxes so deducted during the previous
month. However, if the amount of tax so deducted by any employer in any one
month is less than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the employer may defer the
filing of a return and payment of the amount deducted until the last day of the
month following the end of the calendar quarter in which such month occurred.
Such returns shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable to the
Administrator and shall be subject to the Rules and Regulations prescribed
therefore by the Administrator. Such employer shall be liable for the payment
of the tax required to be deducted and withheld whether or not such taxes have
in fact been withheld. (Ord. 15-2004. Passed 8-11-04.)

chapter undergoes a fundamental change, then the employer and its manager shall
be liable for taxes due up to the date of the fundamental change. Taxes and
final tax returns shall be due immediately after the fundamental change. Any
successor employer shall withhold from any purchase price that the successor
owes to the predecessor an amount sufficient to pay all unpaid taxes, interest
and penalty which the predecessor employer owes pursuant to this chapter. The
successor employer shall make such withholding until such time that the
predecessor employer has paid such taxes, interest and penalties. If the
successor fails to withhold such amount, then the successor and, in a personal
manner, the successor's manager shall be jointly and severally liable for the
payment of the taxes, interest and penalty.
   (c)   (1)   Every manager is deemed to be a trustee of this Municipality in
collecting and holding the tax required under this chapter to be withheld, and
the funds so collected by such withholding are deemed to be trust funds. Every
manager is liable directly to this Municipality for payment of such trust,
whether actually collected by such employer or not. Any tax deducted and
withheld is to be considered paid to this Municipality, whether or not the
employer actually remits the tax to this Municipality, for purposes of
determining employee payments or credits.
      (2)   All managers shall be personally liable to the extent of the tax,
interest and penalty, jointly and severally, for failure to file the employer's
return or to pay the employer's tax, interest and penalty as required under
this chapter.

change, discharges its managers from liability for the employees' or manager's
failure to remit funds held in trust, to file a tax return or to pay taxes.

such other information as may be required by the Administrator. All payments
not subject to withholding shall be reported on a form required by the
Administrator.

payments to be submitted to his office.

including distributive shares of net profits of unincorporated business
entities estimated to be earned by the taxpayer during the current tax year,
together with the estimated tax year due thereon less:
      (1)   Tax withheld within Village, and
      (2)   The tax credit allowed in Section

obtainable from, the Administrator, provided, however, credit shall be taken
for the Village income tax to be withheld from any portion of such income. In
accordance with the provisions of Section
183.14 hereof, credit may be taken for tax to be paid to or to be withheld and
remitted to another taxing municipality.
      (2)   The original declaration, or any subsequent amendment thereof, may
be increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment date
and provided for herein.

the three percent (3%) admissions tax into the General Fund to be distributed
by appropriation to the individual funds as deemed to be in the best interest
of the community as determined by Council.
(Ord. 14-1999. Passed 5-12-99.)
185.02  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this Chapter:
   (a)    "Admission Charge" means the charge made for the right or privilege
to enter into a place, or the charge or fee paid for the use of any facilities
or grounds including the amount charged or paid as annual membership dues to
any club or organization, or charge or fee charged or paid to use any
facilities for a season or longer, provided, however, that if such charge
includes rental of property or for a service such rental or service charge
shall be taken to be an admission charge. If a lesser charge is made to persons
who do not desire to use the property, facilities or services offered, the
lesser charge shall constitute the admission charge. The designation of a
charge as a rental or service charge, or fee of any kind, shall not be
construed to avoid the application of the tax if it is in effect a charge for
admission. Admission charge does not include the following:
      (1)   The rental of residential dwelling units;
      (2)   The rental of commercial business or industrial real property where
no other charge or fee is assessed to persons for the right or privilege of
entry;
      (3)   The charge for periodic day care or nursing home care.
         (Ord. 14-1999. Passed 5-12-99; Ord. 16-1999. Passed 6-9-99.)
      (4)   The use of retail, warehouse stores where memberships are required
for the right or privilege of entry.
(Res. 2016-8-11. Passed 8-9-16.)
   (b)    "Fiscal Officer" means the duly elected Fiscal Officer of the Village
of Boston Heights.
   (c)    "Place" includes, but is not restricted to theaters, dance halls,
amphitheaters, auditoriums, stadiums, athletic pavilions and fields, golf
courses, driving ranges; baseball and athletic parks, circuses, side shows,
swimming pools, outdoor amusement parks and such attractions as merry-go-
rounds, Ferris wheels, dodgems, roller coaster and observation towers owned or
operated by any person.
   (d)    "Person" means any individual, receiver, assignee, firm, co-
partnership, joint venture, corporation, company, joint stock company, park
board, municipal corporation; public authority created by statutes of Ohio,
association, society or any group of individuals acting as a unit, whether
mutual, cooperative, fraternal, nonprofit or otherwise.
(Ord. 14-1999. Passed 5-12-99.)
185.03  LEVY OF TAX.
   There is hereby levied upon every person who pays an admission charge to any
place which is entirely or partially located within the Village:
   (a)    A tax of three percent (3%) of the admission charge paid for
admission to any place, including admission by season ticket or subscriptions
or fee for the privilege of using any facility. The tax shall apply to every
admission charge to any place which is entirely or partially located within the
Village, notwithstanding that the sale of the ticket or other evidence of right
of admission thereto is made outside of the Village.
   (b)    A tax of three percent (3%) of the admission charge paid for
admission to any public performance for a profit at any roof garden, cabaret,
or other similar entertainment in case the charge for admission is in the form
of a service charge or cover charge or other similar charges.
   (c)    A tax of three percent (3%) of the admission charge or other charge
or fee paid for the right or privilege to use any golf course, whether
privately or publicly owned or operated, including green fees, and any annual
or seasonal membership charge or fee.
   (d)    A tax of three percent (3%) of the admissions charge or other charge
or fee paid for the right or privilege to use any driving range, whether
privately or publicly owned or operated, including the cost of a "bucket" of
golf balls, and any annual or seasonal membership charge or fee.
If a place is not entirely located within the Village, the Fiscal Officer shall
determine the percentage of the admissions charge attributable to the portion
of the place located within the Village. In making such determination, the
Fiscal Officer shall consider appropriate factors such as the percentage of the
place's recreational and business activity which is conducted within the City.
Alternatively, the Village and the facility in question which is not located
entirely within the Village of Boston Heights, Ohio, may, by agreement,
determine the appropriate amount of admissions tax by agreement. Such agreement
shall be approved by the Fiscal Officer, ratified by Council, and shall reflect
both parties' understanding that the alternative method agreed upon is a
reasonable determination of the admissions tax to be levied upon that "place"
as it is not entirely located within the Village.
      (Ord. 14-1999. Passed 5-12-99.)
185.04 EXEMPTIONS.
   No tax shall be levied under this chapter with respect to any admission, all
the proceeds of which inure:
   (a)    Exclusively to the benefit of religious, educational or charitable
organizations located in the Village, provided no part of the earnings thereof
inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual.
   (b)    Exclusively to the benefit of persons in the military or naval forces
of the United States, or of national Guard organizations, reserve officer
associations, or posts or organizations of war veterans, or auxiliary units or
societies of any such posts or organizations, if such posts, organizations,
units, or societies are organized in the State, and if no part of their net
earnings inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual.
Immediately after the event for which an exemption from the admissions tax has
been allowed, a responsible individual of the institution, society or
organization for whose benefit such event was held shall file an itemized
statement with the Fiscal Officer setting forth the amount of money actually
received by the treasurer of such institution, society or organization,
together with the expenses of promoting and conducting such event. Such
statement shall be used as a basis of subsequent requests for exemption from
the admissions tax for the benefit of such organization, institution or
society. If such statement shows a disproportionate expenditure for the
promoting and conducting of such event in relation to the profits, if any, no
such exemption shall thereafter be allowed to such institution, society or
organization.
The exemption from tax provided in this section shall not be allowed to any
institution, society or organization which does not control the sale of
admissions to the event for which the exemption is requested, nor shall any
exemption be allowed where talent, services or other items are compensated for
on a percentage basis if such percentage results in a payment in excess of the
flat rate ordinarily charged for the same talent, services or other items. The
exemption provided for shall be subject to the approval of the Fiscal Officer.
      (Ord. 14-1999. Passed 5-12-99.)
185.05  COLLECTION, PAYMENT AND INTEREST.
   (a)    Every person receiving any payment on which a tax is levied under
this chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making
the admission payment. The tax required to be collected under this chapter
shall be deemed to be held in trust by the person required to collect the tax
until paid to the Fiscal Officer as herein provided. Any person required to
collect the tax imposed under this chapter who fails to collect the tax, or
having collected the same, fails to remit such tax to the Fiscal Officer in the
manner prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure is the result of his
own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond his control, shall
nevertheless be personally liable to the Village for the amount of such tax and
shall, unless the remittance is made as herein required, be guilty of a
violation of this chapter.
   (b)    The tax imposed hereunder shall be collected at the time the
admission charge is paid by the person seeking admission to any place and shall
be reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the Fiscal Officer
in monthly installments and remittances therefor on or before the last day of
the month next succeeding the end of the monthly period in which the tax is
collected or received.  
   (c)    Payment or remittance of the tax collected may be made by check,
unless payment or remittance is otherwise required by the Fiscal Officer, but
payment by check shall not relieve the person collecting the tax from liability
for payment and remittance of the tax to the Fiscal Officer unless the check is
honored and is in the full or correct amount. The person receiving any payment
for admissions shall make out a return upon such forms setting forth such
information as the Fiscal Officer may require, showing the amount of the tax
upon admissions for which he or she is liable for the preceding monthly period
and shall sign and transmit the same to the Fiscal Officer with a remittance
for such amount, provided that the Fiscal Officer may, in his discretion,
required verified annual returns from any person receiving admission payments
setting forth such additional information as he may deem necessary to determine
correctly the amount of tax collected and payable.
   (d)    Whenever any theater, circus, show, exhibition or amusement makes an
admission charge which is subject to the tax herein levied, and the same is of
a temporary or transitory nature, of which the Fiscal Officer shall be the
judge, he may require the report and remittance of the admissions tax
immediately upon collection of the same at the conclusion of the performance or
exhibition, or at the conclusion of the series of performances or exhibitions,
or at such other times as the Fiscal Officer shall determine. Failure to comply
with any requirement of the Fiscal Officer as to report and remittance of the
tax as required shall be a violation of this chapter.
   (e)    Any book, record, or account of any person collecting a tax herein
levied, which relates in any manner whatsoever to admission charges, tax
collections or the percentage of the admission charge attributable to the
portion of the place located within the Village shall be subject to examination
and audit by the Fiscal Officer at all reasonable times. If the tax imposed by
this chapter is not paid when due, there shall be added as part of the tax,
interest at the rate of one percent per month from the time the tax became due
until paid. (Ord. 14-1999. Passed 5-12-99.)
185.06  REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE; FEE.
   Any person conducting or operating any place for entrance to which an
admission charge is made shall, on a form prescribed by the Fiscal Officer,
make application to and procure from the Fiscal Officer a Certificate of
Registration, the fee for which shall be one dollars ($1.00), which Certificate
shall continue valid until December 31 of the year in which the same is issued.
Such Certificate or duplicate original copies thereof shall be issued by the
Fiscal Officer without additional charge and shall be posted in a conspicuous
place in each ticket or box office where tickets of admission are sold. (Ord.
14-1999. Passed 5-12-99.)
185.07  TEMPORARY REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE.
   Whenever a Certificate of Registration is obtained for the purpose of
operating or conducting a temporary or transitory amusement, entertainment or
exhibition by persons who are not the owner, lessees or custodians of the
building, lots or place where the amusement is to be conducted, the tax imposed
by this chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in COLLECTION,
PAYMENT AND INTEREST by such owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the
person conducting the place. The application for a Certificate of Registration
for such purpose shall furnish with the application therefore the name and
address of the owner, lessee, or custodian of the premises upon which the
amusement is to be conducted, and such owner, lessee or custodian shall be
notified by the Fiscal Officer of such Certificate and the joint liability for
collection and remittance of such tax.
(Ord. 14-1999. Passed 5-12-99.)
185.08  AUTHORITY TO MAKE RULES, REGULATIONS.
   The Fiscal Officer is hereby authorized to adopt rules and regulations not
inconsistent with the terms of this chapter for carrying out and enforcing the
payment, collection and remittance of the tax therein levied. A copy of such
rules and regulations shall be published and posted in those places designated
by Council for posting of public notices at least once before they become
effective and copies shall be printed and made available in the Office of the
Fiscal Officer. Failure or refusal to comply with any such rules and
regulations shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 14-1999. Passed

is levied at a uniform rate on all persons residing in or earning or receiving
income in The Village of Boston Heights. The tax is levied on income,

context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax

herein shall be on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and

profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by

original cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used
by the taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever

      As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property

         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable

performed in the Village of Boston Heights to wages, salaries, and other

         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
189.12 (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits

         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

Heights.
      (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental

or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the Village of Boston

reporting location.
               (ii)   The individual is permitted or required to perform
services for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
            2.   "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
            3.   "Reporting location" means either of the following:
               (i)   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as
an office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that

employee or owner under Division (8)(a)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
         (b)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer
may elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its
net profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this
election, the provisions of Division (F)(2) of this section apply to such
apportionment except as otherwise provided in this division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
            The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the Village of
Boston Heights' tax administrator which, after applying the apportionment
provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net
profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to
notify the Village of Boston Heights' tax administrator in which a qualifying
remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless
the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that
municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the
employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.
Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under
this division after properly revoking a prior election.
         (c)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in Division
(F)(2)(a) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has
made the election described in Division (F)(2)(b):
            1.    For the purpose of Division (F)(2)(a)(l) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
            2.   For the purpose of Division (F)(2)(a)(2) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
            3.   For the purpose of Division (F)(2)(a)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding Division (F)(2)(a)(d) of this section, any gross receipts of
the business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by
a qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that
individual's qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that
individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (d)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or
a tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all
or a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
as described in Division (F)(2)(b) of this section. However, a tax
administrator shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a
manner that it would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a
municipal corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's
qualifying remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
         (e)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages.

payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village of Boston Heights. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the Village of Boston
Heights as the return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income
subject to the tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the
employee's employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Village of Boston Heights income tax with respect to an
individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of
either the corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued
or of such corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
                  (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer to remit to the Village of Boston Heights the tax withheld relieves
the employee from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax
withheld.
          (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
the Village of Boston Heights income tax or income tax withholding requirement
to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at
the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
         (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village of Boston Heights until such time
as the withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
          (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an
employer shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax
Administrator listing:
                  (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of
all employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Village of Boston Heights during the preceding calendar year;
                  (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such
employee, the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the
preceding calendar year;
                  (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for
which tax was withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during
the preceding calendar year;
                  (d)   Any other information required for federal income tax
reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form
with respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
        (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with
the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village of
Boston Heights income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's
employees and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the
tips and gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this
division, a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or
gratuity is paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to
the employee, or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit
card, or other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section
Occasional Entrant - Withholding.

greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
      For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee
spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)
(b) of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal

more than 20 days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not
include the home of an employee.
      (2)   (a)    Subject to divisions (C)(3), (5), (6), and (7) of this
section, an employer is not required to withhold the Village of Boston Heights
income tax on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of
personal services in the Village of Boston Heights if the employee performed
such services in the Village of Boston Heights on 20 or fewer days in a
calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the

               (a)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to

Heights and has requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's
qualifying wages as provided in Section
189.04.
            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village of Boston Heights only if the employee spent more time performing
services for or on behalf of the employer in the Village of Boston Heights than
in any other municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining
the amount of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent
performing one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have
been spent at the employee's principal place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was

employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Village of Boston Heights exceeds the 20-day
threshold, the employer shall withhold and remit tax to the Village of Boston
Heights for any subsequent days in that calendar year on which the employer
pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the
Village of Boston Heights.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village
of Boston Heights under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to
withhold tax for the Village of Boston Heights for the first 20 days on which
the employer paid qualifying wages to the employee for personal services
performed in the Village of Boston Heights.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the Village of Boston Heights
and the employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
189.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Village of Boston Heights, regardless of the number of days which the employee
worked outside the corporate boundaries of the Village of Boston Heights.
   To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, a the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
189.04. (Ord. 2015-9-23. Passed 10-13-15.)

      (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
189.05 when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income subject to the

Boston Heights income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a

to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of the
following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-2,
"Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the taxpayer's
federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or, in the case
of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio form
IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation
necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.      
         (Ord. 2018-1-1. Passed 1-9-18.)
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form

   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit
return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner
shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Village of Boston Heights to determine and verify the
taxpayer's municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under
division (F) of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on
a generic form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.

individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division

file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Village of Boston
Heights. No remittance is required if the net amount due is ten dollars or

Heights's income tax return. The extended due date of the Village of Boston
Heights's income tax return shall be the 15th day of the tenth month after the
last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time
to file under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due
unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date. For tax years
ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of Boston Heights’
income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be the 15th
day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to which the

extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's the Village of Boston Heights
income tax return. If the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or
before the date the Village of Boston Heights income tax return is due, the Tax
Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a
Village of Boston Heights's income tax return. The extended due date of the
Village of Boston Heights's income tax return shall be the same as the extended
due date of the state income tax return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Village of Boston Heights, the Tax
Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise
than as provided in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required
to file annual returns.
      (5)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
      (6)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under Divisions (G)(2), (3), or (3) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
If a tax administrator violates Division (6) of this section, the Village of
Boston Heights shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred
to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         Division (6) of this section does not apply to an extension received
under Division (2) of this section if the tax administrator has actual
knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required
to receive the extension under Division (2) of this section or failed to file
for an extension under Division (2)(b) or other applicable Division of this
section.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Village of Boston
Heights shall not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits
if the net amount due is ten dollars or less. (Ord. 2015-9-23. Passed 10-13-
15.)
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village of Boston
Heights for a taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall
file with the Village of Boston Heights an annual net profit return under
division (F)(3) of this section, unless the provisions of division (H)(3)
apply.
      (3)   (a)    A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the Village of Boston Heights
income tax ordinance for a taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)    The person was required to file a tax return with the
Village of Boston Heights for the immediately preceding taxable year because
the person performed services at a worksite location (as defined in section
189.04(C)(1)(g)) within the Village of Boston Heights.
            (ii)    The person no longer provides services in the Village of
Boston Heights and does not expect to be subject to the Village of Boston

briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the Village of Boston Heights. The affidavit
shall also include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to
perform any services within the Village of Boston Heights, make any sales in
the Village of Boston Heights, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by
the Village of Boston Heights during the taxable year. If the affiant does
become subject to the tax levied by the Village of Boston Heights for the
taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly
comply as a taxpayer with the Village of Boston Heights income tax ordinance
and rules and regulations." The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty
of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b) the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return
for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)    Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the Village of Boston Heights by an employer, the
agent of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
189.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the Village of Boston Heights, unless the amounts
withheld were not remitted to the Village of Boston Heights and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Village of Boston Heights to be filed in
accordance with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check
to authorize another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the
return, to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to
the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Village of Boston
Heights, provided that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all
of the information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations
adopted by the Village of Boston Heights or the Tax Administrator, and provided
that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise
complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the Village of Boston
Heights's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations governing the filing
of returns, reports, or documents.

      (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)    Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active

States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in

hundred eightieth day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An
applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers
necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or

otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.

this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the

division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in

(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)    For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of

taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Village of
Boston Heights's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group
of corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)
(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to

municipal income tax.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated the Village of Boston Heights income tax return for that
taxable year if the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's
length and that there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with
regard to allocation of net profits to the Village of Boston Heights. A
taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated the Village of Boston Heights
income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated the Village of
Boston Heights income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the
taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to
file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.

of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
189.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated the Village of Boston Heights

subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated the Village of Boston
Heights income tax return shall do one of the following with respect to that
pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
189.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the

Section
189.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
189.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village of Boston Heights;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Village of
Boston Heights income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this
chapter on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated the Village of Boston Heights
income tax return shall make the computations required under divisions (R)
through (Y) of Section
189.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.

income tax return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest,
penalties, fines, charges, or other amounts imposed by the Village of Boston
Heights in accordance with this chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group
of which the corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or
any one or more members of such an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village of Boston Heights before January 1, 2016, to

municipality or the rate of two percent (2%).
   (B)    The Village of Boston Heights shall grant a credit against its tax on

tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.

qualifying wages shall be considered as paid to the Village of Boston Heights
in equal amounts on each payment date unless the taxpayer establishes the dates
on which all amounts were actually withheld, in which case they shall be
considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.

the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
       (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of

         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of

year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section 718.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
189.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes

only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E) An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Village of Boston Heights under Section
189.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village of Boston
Heights but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar

189.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
189.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:

   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
       (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
189.21.

on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
189.18 (A)(4).

189.10  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the Village of Boston
Heights, but should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable
by the Village of Boston Heights as a refund but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village of Boston Heights is subject to recovery
by the Village of Boston Heights. If the Village of Boston Heights's tax on

withholding paid to the other municipality, the Village of Boston Heights shall
allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the Village of
Boston Heights claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the
tax or withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income
or wages.
   (C)    If the Village of Boston Heights's tax rate is less than the tax rate
in the other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated
using the Village of Boston Heights's tax rate. However, if the Village of
Boston Heights's tax rate is greater than the tax rate in the other
municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is to be paid
to the Village of Boston Heights, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.

taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the Village of Boston Heights. The amended return shall be
filed on a form required by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal

   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be

facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
189.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of
Section
189.12 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the Village of Boston Heights. A request filed under this
division shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's
annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is
also filed within the time prescribed in Section
189.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to

computations, and attachments.

tax liability affecting the taxpayer's the Village of Boston Heights's tax
liability, that taxpayer shall make and file an amended the Village of Boston
Heights return showing income subject to the Village of Boston Heights income
tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax liability. The
taxpayer shall pay any additional the Village of Boston Heights income tax
shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax
or overpayment is less than ten dollars. (Ord. 2015-9-23. Passed 10-13-15.)
189.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the

            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
189.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.

   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the

the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village of Boston Heights does
not prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
189.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
189.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover the Village of Boston Heights income tax
or related penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the
following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of

         (Ord. 2015-9-23. Passed 10-13-15.)
189.13 AUDITS. 
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. (Ord. 2015-9-
23. Passed 10-13-15.)
189.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Village of Boston Heights
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
   "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the
mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village of
Boston Heights official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in
this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering
into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an
appeal with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-9-23. Passed 10-13-15.)
189.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village of Boston Heights that arises pursuant to the Village of Boston
Heights's income tax imposed in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. (Ord. 2015-9-23. Passed 10-13-15.)
189.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village of
Boston Heights as authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a
designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the internal revenue
service, the tax commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Village of Boston Heights from
publishing or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose
information with respect to particular taxpayers. (Ord. 2015-9-23. Passed 10-
13-15.)
189.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Village of Boston Heights
ordinance or state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly
procure, counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report,
return, schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or
amend, or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or
amendment of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document is based with intent to defraud the Village of Boston
Heights or the Tax Administrator.
(Ord. 2015-9-23. Passed 10-13-15.)

         (b)    Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to the Village of Boston Heights on or after January 1,
2016.
      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the Village of Boston Heights to which the return is to be filed or the payment

   189.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)    Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of

provided by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records,
memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         (b)    The powers referred to in this division of this section shall
be exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance

of Boston Heights's income tax ordinance;

         (b)    If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-

withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and

in the request.
      (2)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or
other person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is
subject to, the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the Village of Boston Heights or for the
withholding of such tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.
Identification information.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
189.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
189.99.
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
189.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
189.18.
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
189.99 for a violation of Section
189.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (F)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal. (Ord. 2015-9-23. Passed 10-13-15.)

members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Village of
Boston Heights, but such appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or
contractors with the Village of Boston Heights at any time during their term or
in the five years immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member
shall be appointed by the Mayor of the Village of Boston Heights. This member
may be an employee of the Village of Boston Heights, but may not be the
director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other
similar official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or
any direct subordinate thereof.
      (2)    The term for members of the Board of Tax Review for the Village of
Boston Heights shall be two years. There is no limit on the number of terms
that a member may serve if the member is reappointed by the legislative
authority. The board member appointed by the Mayor of the Village of Boston
Heights shall serve at the discretion of the administrative official.
      (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.

meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
      (6)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons
why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC. (Ord. 2015-9-23. Passed 10-13-15.)
189.22 AUTHORITY TO CREATE RULES AND REGULATIONS. 
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the legislative authority of the
Village of Boston Heights, or a Tax Administrator pursuant to authority granted
to the administrator by resolution or ordinance, to adopt rules to administer
an income tax imposed by the Village of Boston Heights in accordance with this

vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this subsection may recover the

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in addition
to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within

Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

303.09 LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. (ORC
4513.64)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open. (A.O.)
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   Council, the Chief of Police, or the Municipal Zoning Inspector, may serve
notice on a person having the right to the possession of property on which a
junk motor vheicle is left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the
junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other
suitable structure or shall be removed from the property. The notice referred
to herein may either be served personally on the party or it may be sent by
certified mail with the return receipt requested, to the person having the
right of the possession of the property. (Ord. 15-1984. Passed 3-14-84.)
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.65)
303.11 OUTSIDE STORAGE OF UNLICENSED VEHICLES PROHIBITED; NOTICE.
   (a)   No person, firm or corporation shall park, store or permit to be
stored any motor vehicle on any lot or parcel of land within the Municipality

enclosed within the confines of a building or garage and is completely shielded
from the view of passers-by on the street in front of such lot or parcel of
land, and unless such motor vehicle is registered pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4503 et
seq. and the number plates issued to such current registration year are

(Ord. 7-1966. Passed 3-9-66.)
   (b)   Whenever any motor vehicle is found to be in violation of this

vehicle is parked or stored or to the owner, if known, of the unregistered
motor vehicle, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the unregistered
motor vehicle shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable
structure or shall be removed from the property. The Chief of Police may serve
such notice by either personally serving a copy on the person involved, having
a subordinate police officer serve personally the notice on the person, or he
may send a notice by certified mail with return receipt requested.
   (c)   No person shall willfully leave an unregistered motor vehicle
uncovered in the open for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as
provided in this section. The fact that an unregistered motor vehicle is so
left is prima facie evidence of willful failure to comply with the notice. Each
subsequent day an unregistered motor vehicle continues to be so left shall be
considered a separate offense.
(Ord. 15-1984. Passed 3-14-84.)
   (d)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,

predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate

taxed as costs in any related civil or criminal proceeding, or collected with
the towing and storage fees when the vehicle is claimed. Unless the authorizing
towing company holding the vehicle has received official notice that the fee
has been paid, the fee shall be collected when the owner or the owner's
representative claims the vehicle, and if not paid directly to the Village,
shall be remitted to the Village by the towing company within thirty (30) days.
An impounded vehicle shall not be released without the administrative charge

   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which

and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety

fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or

convenience and safe use of the streets and highways.

the flow of traffic must provide for a Village police officer to be on duty
during the hours of construction activity. Such police officer shall be
provided to insure that traffic control is handled in a manner which will
insure a steady and efficient flow of traffic. Whenever this section requires
that a police officer be scheduled for traffic control, the construction
company, individual or entity involved must commit to at least four hours per

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is

(ORC 4511.12; Ord. 2018-9-7. Passed 9-25-18.)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right of way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic control
device.
   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;
         C.   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the

governing such movement. No passing signs may also be erected facing traffic to
indicate the beginning and end of each no passing zone.
   When appropriate signs or markings indicating hazardous or no passing zones
are in place and clearly visible, every operator of a vehicle shall obey the
directions of the signs or markings, notwithstanding the distance set out in
Section
331.06.

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years. The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. (ORC 4511.19)
            5.   In all cases, if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s
name, immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense for ninety days in

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public

      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be

or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

R.C. Chapter 4506.
   (b)   (1)   No person shall receive a driver’s license, or a motorcycle

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

339.12 WEIGHING VEHICLE; SCALES TO BE USED; REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOAD ALTERATION
OF WEIGHT LIMITS.
   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a vehicle and
its load is unlawful may require the driver of such vehicle to stop and submit
to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways;
a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a load-
receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of highway
vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined load of
all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway vehicle, or a
sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or unloaded. The
driver of such vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed to the
nearest available of such sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided
such scales are within three miles of the point where such vehicle is stopped.
Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the police
officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as prescribed by
this section. All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and
its load shall be annually compared by a Municipal, County or State sealer with
the State standards or standards approved by the State and such scales shall
not be sealed if they do not conform to the State standards or standards
approved by the State.
   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a straight
approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and width to
insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
   During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, they shall always be used on terrain of sufficient length and width
to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. Such terrain shall be level,
or if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in elevation
between the wheels on any one axle does not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed one-fourth
inch per foot of the distance between such axles. Whenever compact, self-
contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel
loads of vehicles on highways, are used the weights determined are not unlawful
unless they exceed by more than three percent of the weight limitations set
forth in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.14.
   In all determination of all weights, except gross weight, by compact, self-
contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel
loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, twelve feet or less apart,
shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside
wheel of each such axle. In determinations of gross weight by the use of
compact, self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to
determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be weighed
simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside wheel of each axle.
   Whenever such officer upon weighing a vehicle and load determines that the
weight is unlawful, he may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable
place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed as is
necessary to reduce the weight of such vehicle to the limit permitted under
Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.14, or, when compact, self-contained, portable,
sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, are used, to the limits permitted under Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.14,
plus two percent.
   Whenever local authorities determine upon the basis of an engineering and
traffic investigation that the weight limits permitted under Ohio R.C. 5577.01
to 5577.14, or weight limits permitted when compact, self-contained, portable,
sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, are used on any part of a State route under their jurisdiction is
greater than is reasonable under the conditions found to exist at such
location, the local authorities may, by resolution, request the Director of
Transportation to determine and declare reasonable weight limits. Upon receipt
of such request, the Director may determine and declare reasonable weight
limits at such location, and if the Director alters the weight limits set by
Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.14, and this section, then such altered weight limits
shall become effective only when appropriate signs giving notice thereof are
erected at such location by local authorities.
   The Director may withdraw his approval of any altered weight limit whenever,
in his opinion, any altered weight limit becomes unreasonable, and upon such
withdrawal the altered weight limit shall become ineffective, and the signs
relating thereto shall be immediately removed by local authorities. Alteration
of weight limits on State routes by local authorities is not effective until
alteration has been approved by the Director.
   This section does not derogate or limit the power and authority conferred
upon the Director or boards of county commissioners by Ohio R.C. 5577.07.
   In the event the provisions of this section should be held to exceed the
weight limitations, or provisions set forth in Section 127, "Federal-Aid
Highway Act of 1958," 72 Stat. 902 (1958), 23 U.S.C. 127, this section shall
become null and void to the extent of such inconsistency.

339.13 ENGINE BRAKING.
   (a)   “Engine braking” means any device equipped on certain commercial
vehicles including, but not limited to, tractors, semi-trucks, and motor
carriers and buses that utilize engine compression release or engine retarders
as a means of slow or braking the speed of the vehicle in lieu of applying the
clutch or brakes.
 
   (b)   No person while operating a motor vehicle, or any vehicle mentioned in
subsection (a), shall employ “engine braking” to decelerate the motor vehicle.
 
   (c)   This section shall not apply to fire protection equipment or other
emergency vehicles or if used by an operator of a vehicle in an emergency
situation to avert imminent danger.

339.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates the weight provisions of Chapter
339 shall be fined eighty dollars ($80.00) for the first 2,000 pounds or
fraction thereof, of overload. For overloads in excess of 2,000 pounds but not
in excess of 5,000 pounds, such person shall be fined one hundred dollars
($100.00) and in addition therefor one dollar ($1.00) per 100 pounds of
overload; for overloads in excess of 5,000 pounds, such person shall be fined
one hundred thirty dollars ($130.00) and in addition thereto, two dollars
($2.00) per 100 pounds of overload, or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or

one hundred sixty dollars ($160.00) and in addition thereto three dollars
($3.00) per 100 pounds of overload, or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or
both. Whoever violates the weight provisions of vehicles and load relating to
gross load limits shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
However, no penalty prescribed in this section shall be imposed on any vehicle
combination if: the overload on any axle does not exceed 1,000 pounds and the
immediately preceding or following axle, except for the front axle or vehicle
combination is underloaded by the same or greater amount. For purposes of this
subsection, two axles on one vehicle less than eight feet apart shall be
considered as one axle.

   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because
of his complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or
claimed complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great
caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 Type of Misdemeanor                         Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

provisions of Ohio R.C. Chapter 1509 and the rules and regulations promulgated
by the Chief of the Division of Oil and Gas pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 1509

Municipal Ordinance. All pumps left on the site after the drilling is
completed, to aid in the operation of the oil and gas well shall be powered by
an electric motor.
   (d)   (1)   Storage tanks, separators, such as are at well installations and

located within the enclosed area at least six feet inside of the fence.
      (2)   The enclosed area created by the fence required herein shall be
kept clear of weeds and bushes and the owner or party in control of such area

for the operation and maintenance of each well and tank site shall be given to
the Zoning Inspector who in turn shall advise the Police and Fire Departments.

the spill. Should anyone become aware of a spill at a site, the Police Chief
and the Fire Chief shall be notified. The Fire Department shall be dispatched
to the scene. The operator shall be notified immediately by the Chief of Police

inspection shall be made after completion of all such work.
   (i)   When drilling any well for oil/gas, the drilling rig shall have a
blow-out preventor in good working order attached to the drilling equipment to
prevent gas or oil from blowing out of control and causing damage to
surrounding areas. All trees, shrubs, bushes, and other vegetation located near
the well site which are killed or may be killed by reason of the venting or
escaped gases and oil, or salt water shall be removed by the person,
partnership, corporation, or entity in possession of the well site. This
requirement applies to damage done during the drilling operation or anytime
thereafter during the operation of the well site by the producer.

receipt of the notice. If the owner or person having charge of the oil and gas
well site is a nonresident whose address is known, such notice shall be served
to his address by registered mail. If unknown, it shall be sufficient to serve
such notice by posting it at the premises involved. The notices set forth in
this section shall be served by the Chief of Police or any police officer in
the Village. The official who becomes aware of the violation shall notify the
Police Department of such violation and that notification by that official
shall complete that official's notice requirement as set forth herein. If the
owner or person having control of the well site fails to comply with such
notice, the Street Commissioner shall cause the condition which constitutes the
noncompliance with this section to be corrected. All expenses and labor costs
incurred in correcting the problem, when approved by Council, shall be paid out
of Municipal funds not otherwise appropriated. The Fiscal Officer shall make a
written notice of the action to the County Auditor with a statement of the
charges for services, amount paid for labor, and other reasonable expenses,
along with a proper description of the premises. Such amounts, when allowed,
shall be entered upon a tax duplicate to be a lien upon such land from and

excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:

for juveniles.

   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially

purpose;

subsection (a) of this section shall consider any written policy that the
seller has adopted and implemented and that is intended to prevent violations
of subsection (a) of this section. For purposes of subsection (c)(1)C. of this
section, the trier of fact shall consider that reasonable reliance upon the

determine, and that the use of a transaction scan device does not excuse a
seller or an agent or employee of a seller from exercising reasonable diligence

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2909.11)
541.02 ARSON.
   (a)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause or
create a substantial risk of physical harm to any property of another without
the other person’s consent.
   (b)   (1)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause
or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that
is not an occupied structure;
      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

1101.06  PROFESSIONAL FEES AND COSTS; ACCOUNT ESTABLISHED; DEPOSIT BY APPLICANT

and/or the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be required to reimburse the Village
for any professional fees and related costs associated with the Village's
review, analysis, inspection, and other activity related to such request.
   (b) The Planning Commission shall, subject to the approval of the Mayor and
a majority vote of Council, establish a Professional Fees, Costs, and Review
Account for the Village of Boston Heights. The funds placed in this Review
Account are subject to the deposit and fee schedules described in subparts (c)
and (d) herein.
   (c) A Professional Fees and Costs Deposit shall accompany each application,
license, or request submitted to the Village Engineer, Street Commissioner,
Zoning Inspector, Planning Commission, and/or the Board of Zoning Appeals. The
Deposit shall be placed in a Professional Fees, Costs, and Review Account,
which shall be maintained for each separate application, license or request.
The initial Deposit shall be received before the Village will incur any
professional fee or cost associated with the Village's review, analysis,
inspection, and other activity related to an applicant's request. The specific
amount for an initial Deposit shall be established in a schedule created by the
Mayor and approved by the Village Engineer and a majority vote of Council. The
Mayor may, on a case by case basis, assess an applicant an additional Deposit
based upon anticipated future professional fees and costs. At all times during
the pendency of an application, license or request where professional fees and/
or costs for the Village are required, such fees and costs shall be charged
against the Professional Fees and Cost Deposit on a monthly and/or as needed
basis and a positive balance shall be maintained in an applicant's professional
review account. The Village shall give notice to an applicant once the balance
in the applicant's professional review account reaches a five hundred dollar
($500.00) or lower balance if an additional Deposit will be required. Should
the fees as set forth in subpart (d) consume the entire initial Professional
Fees and Costs Deposit, all reviews, consideration, deliberation and analysis
of the subject application, license or request by the Village shall be
suspended and no further construction, work, and/or further use shall be done
by the applicant or its agents until a supplemental Deposit is assessed and
deposited. The balance of the Deposit funds on hand, after fees are assessed to
said applicant, shall be returned to the applicant within 90 days of the final
conclusion of the project and any potential legal matter pertaining to the
request, application or license.
   (d) The Mayor shall also create a fee schedule for various tasks associated
with the professional review, inspection or other conduct required in
association with any application, request or license submitted to the Village
Engineer, Street Commissioner, Zoning Inspector, Planning Commission, and/or
the Board of Zoning Appeals. The fee schedule shall be created by the Mayor
with the approval of the Village Engineer and a majority vote of Council. The
fees shall be charged against the Professional Fees and Cost Deposit on a
monthly and/or as needed basis. The fees set forth in the schedule shall not
conflict with any other fee established by the Codified Ordinances.   
   (e) No approvals shall be granted for any application, license, or other
request submitted to the Village Engineer, Street Commissioner, Zoning
Inspector, Planning Commission, and/or the Board of Zoning Appeals unless and
until the required initial and/or supplemental Deposit have been made.

grading, soil preparation or other activity conducted by an applicant related
to a project that requires a Deposit under this Codified Ordinance is strictly

work completed without the submission of an initial and/or supplemental Deposit
shall be subject to removal and/or demolition by the Village at the applicant's
costs.

conditions or circumstances; and
      (6)   That upon the granting of the variance that the use of the property
will continue to be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of this
Code and with the Zoning District and will not be injurious to the neighborhood
or detrimental to the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (b)   Additional Standards for Use Variances. The Board shall not consider
or grant a Use Variance when the use is otherwise prohibited in the Zoning
District in which the property is located. In such cases, the applicant may
submit a Rezoning Application pursuant to Section
1147.03. The Board may only grant a Use Variance if:
      (1)   The literal enforcement of the provisions of this Code pertaining
to the use of the property would cause the applicant practical difficulties.
      (2)   The variance would not be detrimental to the public health, safety,
and general welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located
   (c)   Additional Standards for Size and Area Variances. Where the applicant
seeks a variance pertaining to an area requirement otherwise applicable to the
property, no variance may be granted unless the applicant has demonstrated that
literal enforcement of the provisions of this Code pertaining to size and are
requirements would cause the applicant practical difficulties. The factors to
be considered and weighed in determining whether an applicant seeking an area
variance has encountered practical difficulties in the proposed use of his
property include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
      (2)   Whether the variance is substantial;
      (3)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
      (4)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (e.g. water, sewer, garbage);
      (5)   Whether the applicant purchased the property with the knowledge of
the zoning restrictions;
      (6)   Whether the applicant's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
      (7)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
   (d)   Conditions. If the Board approves a variance the Board may further
prescribe any conditions and safeguards that it deems necessary to insure that
the objectives of the provisions to which the variance applies will be met and
completed.
   (e)   Effect of a Variance.
      (1)   The issuance of a variance shall authorize only the particular
variation that is approved in the variance.
      (2)   A variance, including any conditions, shall run with the land and
shall not be affected by a change in ownership, unless otherwise specified.
         (Ord. 2017-7-15. Passed 9-12-17.)
1145.07 REVOCATION OF VARIANCE.
   The breach of any condition, safeguard or requirement imposed by the Board
as a condition of its approval of an applicant's petition for a variance shall
as determined by the Zoning Inspector invalidate the variance granted and shall
constitute a violation of this Planning and Zoning Code, subject to an appeal
to the Board. Such violation shall be punishable as provided by Section
1143.99. (Ord. 2017-7-15. Passed 9-12-17.)

or public way, shall be automatically extended to the center of such vacation
and all areas included in the vacation shall thereafter be subject to all
regulations of the extended districts.
(Ord. 2017-7-15. Passed 9-12-17.)
1151.04 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A non-residential district is any zoning district other than a
Residential District.
      (2)   Any non-residential district use shall have a buffer zone of
undeveloped land between said use and any adjacent Residential District area.
Undeveloped land means, at a minimum, that no structure, parking area, or open
storage will be permitted thereon. Said buffer zone shall not be less than 100
feet in width. The buffer zone shall run along entire property line between the
non-residential district and the adjacent Residential District. Such buffer
zone shall be landscaped to provide effective and permanent visual screening as
approved by the Village Engineer. If there is a road separating the two
district areas then the buffer zone shall be measured from the center of the
right of way.
      (3)   Any non-residential district use bordering a Residential District
area shall have two height restricted zones between said use and the
undeveloped land buffer zone of Section
1151.04(a)(2). The first height restricted zone shall border the undeveloped
land buffer and have a width of not less than 100 feet. Structures located in
this first height restricted zone may not exceed the lesser of fourteen feet or
one story. The second height restricted zone shall border the first height
restricted zone and have a width of not less than 100 feet. Structures located
in this second height restricted zone may not exceed the lesser of twenty-eight

   (d) The provisions of Chapters
1151 through
1162 shall not be construed to remove or render inoperative any restrictions on
land established by restrictive covenants. However, when any provision of this
chapter imposes a greater restriction upon buildings or premises than is
imposed by any such restrictive covenants, the provisions of this chapter shall
control and be in force and effect. If any provision of this Chapter imposes a
lower or less restrictive standard than any other Village ordinance or State
law, then the higher or more restrictive standard contained in such other
ordinance or law shall prevail.

requirements contained within the code of ordinances:
      (1)   The proposed use will be consistent with the intent and purposes of
this zoning code and the Village Comprehensive Land Use Plan.
      (2)   The proposed use will comply with all applicable requirements of
this code, except as specifically altered in the approved conditional use.
      (3)   The proposed use will be compatible with the character of the
general vicinity.
      (4)   The proposed use and site layout will not impede the normal and
orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district. Due consideration will be given to the location and
height of proposed buildings and structures, location and type of proposed
fences or walls, location and screening of parking areas, roadways and roadway
connections, and the location and type of proposed landscaping and buffer
areas.
      (5)   The area and proposed use will be adequately served by essential
public facilities and services, as applicable, such as highways, streets,
police, and fire protection, drainage structures, refuse disposal, water and
sewer. The applicant or landowner will be required to install public utilities,
streets or other public infrastructure as required by the city, state or other
agencies to applicable specifications that are necessitated by the conditional
use development. Dedication of said public infrastructure may be required.
      (6)   The proposed use will not involve uses, activities, processes,
materials, equipment or conditions of operation, that will be detrimental to
any persons, property, or the general welfare by reason of excessive production
of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, glare, odor or other characteristic not
comparable to the uses permitted in the zoning district.
      (7)   The location and scale of the use, the nature and intensity of the
proposed operations, the site layout and the relation of the proposed use to
surrounding streets will not cause undue traffic congestion or hazards adjacent
to the site or in the immediate vicinity beyond that which would be normally
expected based on the existing pattern of uses and the planned character
reflected in the Village's Comprehensive Land Use Plan. Peak hour volumes,
turning movements, existing street capacity, driveway spacing, sight distances
and pedestrian traffic shall all be considered.
      (8)   The proposed use will protect identified natural areas as outlined
in the Village Comprehensive Land Use Plan.
      (9)   The proposed use will protect the health, safety, and welfare; and
the social and economic wellbeing of those who will use the land or activity
under consideration, the residents, business owners and landowners immediately
adjacent to the proposed use or activity, and the community as a whole.
      (10)   The proposed use will promote connectivity within the site and to
adjoining roadways and development areas.
      (11)   The proposed use will include quality public and semi-public
spaces that help advance the goals for the Hines Hill Corridor Plan.

1163.06 AREA-WIDE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General Design Standards.
      (1)   A primary building shall be oriented parallel to a dedicated or
private street, or as parallel as the site permits.
      (2)   The height of a building shall be a minimum of eighteen (18) feet
above grade.
      (3)   A building frontage that exceeds a width of fifty (50) feet shall
incorporate articulation, offsets of the wall plane, and/or pilasters to
inhibit a large expanse of blank wall and add interest to the facade.
      (4)   For a primary building frontage of a commercial use in any Sub
District, a minimum of forty (40) percent of the façade area facing a dedicated

   (b)   Architectural Standards.
      (1)   Style and Character.
         A.   Development should be consistent in character to reflect the
style of the Connecticut Western Reserve. Buildings should use materials,
details and proportions similar to Early American styles, from Greek Revival,
through Federal and Georgian to Queen Anne and something colloquially called
"Farmhouse Colonial."
         B.   Style and character clues can be taken from historic examples
without being literal duplications, and be applied to buildings and structures
in a New England Village or farmstead pattern.
      (2)   Architectural Details.
         A.   The use of architectural detailing is strongly encouraged to
provide scale and interest to the building. Examples of detailing include stone
foundations, masonry water tables, masonry window trim or surrounds, frieze
boards, decorative cornices, quoins, shutters, columns, balusters, awnings and
similar items.
      (3)   Mass/Scale.
         A.   Mass and scale should emulate the Connecticut Western Reserve
Style. Façade treatment should be formed to break the appearance into smaller
facades to better relate to the pedestrian scale. Detail elements (as outlined
above) should be used to create a pedestrian scale. Special treatment of the
corner of buildings should be considered. Building heights equaling two stories
(twenty feet) or more are encouraged.
      (4)   Materials and Configurations.
         A.   Wall surfaces of buildings adjacent to the main thoroughfares
should consist of 70 percent traditional or natural materials. Traditional or
natural materials shall include, brick, stone or engineered stone, wood, cement
composite, or metal. The balance of the building's elevations not directly
visible from public view shall include materials consistent with those on the
front in varying percentages with a minimum of 50 percent traditional or
natural materials. Exterior Insulation and Finish System (EIFS) and like stucco
shall not be permitted as a building material on any elevation.

natural finish. Split face stone is acceptable in limited situations. Stone
shall be laid in a traditional pattern indicative of the Connecticut Western
Reserve Period.
            3.   Siding should be of traditional profiles such as 4 inches - 8
inches horizontal beveled. Vinyl (not less than 44 mil thickness) shall not
exceed 30 percent of the building materials; the remainder shall be traditional
or natural as stated in previous sections.
            4.   Glass openings shall be a minimum of 15% of the entire wall.
         B.   Minimum Wall Articulation:
            1.   There shall be no blank, un-articulated building walls
exceeding 30 feet in length. All building walls shall be designed to meet all
the following standards:
            2.   All office building walls shall consist of a building bay or
structural building system that is a maximum of 30 feet in width. Bays shall be
visually established by architectural features such as columns, ribs or
pilasters, piers, changes in wall planes, changes in texture or materials, and
fenestration pattern no less than twelve inches (12 inches) in width.
            3.   Free standing office buildings within this district must have
4 sided detail.
            4.   Any wall exceeding 30 feet in length shall include at least
one change in wall plane, such as projections or recesses. Offset distance
should be at least 12 inches and is encouraged to be more. Offsets shall extend
at least twenty percent (20%) of the entire length of the façade.
      (5)   Roof.
         A.   Materials:
            1.   Natural or simulated slate or tile, wood shakes, dimensional
shingles (minimum of 30 yr. warranty), standing seam metal (minimum of 20 yr.
paint warranty), copper, metal, or flat roof systems (when hidden from public
view).
         B.    Roofs shall have one or more of the following features:
            1.   Parapets concealing flat roofs and rooftop equipment such as
HVAC units from public view are appropriate. The average height of such
parapets shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the height of the supporting
wall and such parapets shall not at any point exceed one-third (1/3) of the
height of the supporting wall. Such parapets shall feature three dimensional
cornice treatment;
            2.   Minimum 8 inches roof overhangs are required on all pitched
roofs.
            3.   Sloping roofs shall have a minimum pitch of 5/12.
            4.   Sloping roofs that do not exceed the average height of the
supporting walls, with a minimum of 5/12 slope and a maximum of 18/12 slope.
Single story retail and office buildings and residential buildings may have
sloped roof with a maximum height of 1½ times the supporting wall.
            5.   Three (3) or more roof slope planes.
         C.   Buildings less than 16 feet in height shall have sloped roofs.
Roofs shall have a minimum of 5/12 slope and a maximum of 18/12 slope. Mansard
roofs are acceptable provided that they meet the minimum slope requirements and
are a minimum of 8 feet in height.
         D.   All roof-top equipment must be screened.
         E.   The use of eaves, rakes, cornice lines and etc. are strongly
encouraged to add visual interest.
      (6)   Openings.
         A.   Glass openings for retail and office buildings shall be between
30 - 70% of the entire wall.

traditional wood frame when practical.
         C.   Wood, vinyl, aluminum, aluminum clad, steel and fiberglass are
acceptable.
         D.   Glass can be tinted or clear; reflective glass shall not be
permitted.
         E.   The majority of glazed openings should be of vertical orientation
(min. height = 1½ width) unless part of a store front or contextual to the
building style. The intent is to eliminate the look of the modern "ribbon
window" and portray a traditional proportion associated with mid-twentieth
century construction. However, small amounts of a more contemporary approach
may be acceptable if part of the overall design strategy.
         F.   The appearance of divided light windows is preferred.
   (c)   Landscaping and Screening.
      (1)   Intent.
         A.   Landscaping is a visible indicator of quality development and
must be an integral part of the project, and not merely located in leftover
portions of the site. Landscaping is intended to visually tie the entire
development together, define major entryways and circulation (both vehicular
and pedestrian) and parking patterns, and, where appropriate, help buffer less
intensive adjacent land uses.
      (2)   Plant Materials.
         A.   Intent:
            1.   Incorporate plant species found throughout the region into the
planting plan, and visually soften paved areas and buildings. Use and repeat
plant materials throughout the development to visually tie the commercial
center together.
         B.   Design Guidelines and Standards:
            1.   Each area required to be landscaped shall be covered in live
material. Live material includes trees, shrubs, ground cover, and sod.
         C.   Shade Trees:
            1.   All shade trees shall be a minimum caliper of 2½ inches at the
time of plating. Street trees shall be of a variety which will attain an
average mature spread greater than 20 feet unless a columnar variety is
specified to meet design criteria.
         D.   Ornamental Trees:
            1.   Ornamental trees shall be a minimum of 1¾ inches in caliper
upon planting.
         E.   Evergreen Trees:

user the location of a specific business. Business identification signage is
generally intended to be seen by motorists from the adjacent thoroughfare to
attract them to a specific location. All signage is not necessarily intended to
be viewed from a public street; however if signs are visible from a public
street, they must not compromise public safety by attracting undue attention.
         B.   Signage must be subservient to the overall design and impression
of the architecture.
         C.   All signage shall be encouraged to be highly designed and unique
to the individual tenant to contribute to the overall design theme. This
includes: street signage, parking signage, directional signage, kiosks, etc.
      (2)   General Requirements.
         A.   The following sign and sign components shall not be permitted:
            1.   Flashing, oscillating or moving signs.

any intersection or access drive with a public street. Monument signs must
incorporate design and materials that match the architecture of the
development.
         E.   Ground mounted monument signs must be incorporated with a masonry
base of at least 24 inches in height consisting of brick or stone matching the
materials found on the main building.
         F.   Pylon signs are not permitted within this district.
      (3)   Signage Allowances.
         A.   Buildings within this district shall be permitted the following
signage types:

               a.   Ground mounted monument signs may be permitted within the
building frontage on a major roadway. Monument sign will be of a pedestrian
scale (maximum of 6 feet height) and will be set back a minimum of 10 feet from
the right of way. Monument signs in this district will be limited to a maximum
display area of 40 square feet per side and must meet the general sign
requirements of this district. Signs shall be located with a minimum 50 square
feet landscape bed around the sign base. Signs should be architecturally
compatible with the building.
            2.   Building Mounted Facade Signs:

provided no illumination is used and the area is no more than 25% of the
allowable area of the primary sign.
               c.   Buildings within this district occupying a corner location
may be permitted building mounted signage on the secondary facade. Secondary
facade signage shall not exceed .5 square feet of sign area per 1 linear foot
of secondary building frontage.
   (i)   Fencing And Walls.
      (1)   Intent:
         A.   While fences and walls are often necessary to buffer uses, they
can create a visually-monotonous streetscape. These standards provide fencing
and walls that are visually-appealing, complement the design of the overall
development and surrounding properties, and provide visual interest to
pedestrians and motorists.
      (2)   Design Guidelines and Standards: When a commercial development
includes a fence or wall, the following guidelines and standards apply:
         A.   The maximum height of a fence or wall shall be six feet (6 feet).

treated or painted.
         D.   Walls shall be constructed of high quality materials, such as
decorative blocks, brick, stone, and wrought iron.
         E.   Breaks in the length of a fence shall be made to provide for
required pedestrian connections to the perimeter of a site or to adjacent
development.
         F.   The maximum length of continuous, unbroken, and uninterrupted
fence or wall plane shall be fifty feet (50 feet). Breaks shall be provided
through the use of columns, landscaping pockets, transparent sections, and/or a
change to different materials.
         G.   Fences and walls shall be set back from the property line to
allow a landscape setback area. Such setback area shall be landscaped with a
turf, shrubs, and/or trees, using a variety of species to provide seasonal
color and plant variety.
         H.   Use of landscaping beyond the minimum required in these standards
is strongly encouraged to soften the visual impact of fences and walls.

         C.    Violation of any conditions and/or safeguards prescribed shall
be deemed a violation of this Zoning Code.
      (2)   An application for such change in use shall be filed pursuant to
Section
1145.04.

(1)   Expansion of Nonconforming Use of Land. A nonconforming use of land shall
not be physically enlarged, increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of
land than was occupied by the use at the time it became nonconforming.
      (2)   Relocation of Nonconforming Use of Land. A nonconforming use of
land shall not be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel
other than those portions occupied by the use at the time it became
nonconforming.
   (c)    Structures Occupied by Nonconforming Use.
      (1)   Extension of Nonconforming Use within Building.  A nonconforming
use of an existing structure may be extended throughout any parts of a building
that were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption
or amendment to this Zoning Code. However, no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building not previously occupied by such
nonconforming use.
      (2)   Expansion of Building(s). No such building shall be enlarged,
altered, or expanded to increase the nonconforming use, and no additional
structures shall be constructed in connection with such nonconforming use
unless the Board determines that the proposed changes, additions and/or
improvements shall upgrade the activity and make the resulting development more
compatible to the Zoning District for which it is zoned and more compatible
with the adjacent uses.
      (3)   Reconstruction of a Building Occupied by a Nonconforming Use.
Except as provided for in Subsection
1173.02(c)(4) below, no building or structure occupied by a nonconforming use
shall be reconstructed except when the use is changed to a Permitted Use in the
Zoning District in which it is located, or upon prior approval of the Board and
the Board determines that the proposed improvements shall upgrade the activity
and make the resulting development more compatible to the Zoning District for
which it is zoned and more compatible to the adjacent uses.
      (4)   Damage or Destruction. Any building or structure containing a
nonconforming use, which has been damaged by fire or other causes may be
reconstructed and used as before if such reconstruction is done within twelve
(12) months of such calamity, unless damaged for more than sixty percent (60%)
of its fair market value, as determined by the Board at the time of such
damage. If damage is more than sixty percent (60%), the Board shall have the
right to permit or refuse continuance of the nonconforming use on the basis of
its degree of nuisance to the    surrounding areas.
   (d)   Discontinuance of Use. Whenever a nonconforming use of a building,
part of a building, lot or part of a lot is discontinued for one (1) year, such
discontinuance shall constitute voluntary abandonment of such use and any
subsequent use of the building, part of a building, lot or part of a lot shall
conform to the use regulations specified by this Zoning Code for the Zoning
District in which such land is located.
      (Ord. 2017-7-15. Passed 9-12-17.)
1173.03 NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.

public nuisance, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   Enlargement. Repair, and Alterations. A nonconforming building or
structure may be enlarged, maintained, repaired, or structurally altered
provided the additions are made to conform to all the regulations of the Zoning
District in which it is located. However, no such enlargement, maintenance,
repair, or structural alteration shall either create any additional
nonconformity or increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of all or
any part of such building or structure with respect to the regulations in this
Zoning Code.
   (b)   Moving. No building or structure which is nonconforming under this

moved.
   (c)   Restoration of Damaged Building or Structure. If a nonconforming
building or structure is damaged or destroyed by any means, those portions so
destroyed or damaged may be restored to the original footprint and floor area
of the building or structure, provided the reconstruction is begun within one
(1) year of the damage or destruction. Any restoration that exceeds the
original footprint and/or floor area shall comply shall comply with the
provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (d)   Change in Principal Use of Building. The principal use of a
nonconforming building may be changed to any other Permitted Use in the Zoning
District in which it is located so long as the new use complies with all
provisions of this Zoning Code specified for such use, except the regulations
to which the building did not conform prior to the change in use.
   (e)   Variances from Zoning District provisions on area, lot coverage, lot
width, height, setbacks, location on the lot may be granted by the Board where
necessary and where such application for a variance meets the requirements of
an Area Variance. (Ord. 2017-7-15. Passed 9-12-17.)

variance shall be required from any provision of this Zoning Code with which
the lot does not comply other than those pertaining to minimum area, lot width,
depth, and/or frontage, and shall be obtained only through action of the Board.
   (b)   Where there are two or more Nonconforming Lots with continuous
frontage and in single ownership, those lots shall be considered to be an
undivided parcel for the purposes of conformity with this Zoning Code. If this
undivided parcel is in conformity with the minimum area, lot width, depth, and/
or frontage requirements of this Zoning Code, no portion of this undivided
parcel shall be used or conveyed in any manner that will create a lot that
fails to be in compliance with the minimum area, lot width, depth, and/or
frontage requirements of this Code.

need not exceed ten percent (10%) of the width of the lot; the depth of the
rear yard need not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the depth of the lot.
However, in no instance shall the minimum dimensions of the side and the rear

nonconforming sign. Nonconforming signs shall comply with the provisions set
forth in Chapter
1179.
        (b) Nothing in this Zoning Code shall prevent the temporary removal of
an established sign for the purpose of cleaning, repainting and/or repair, as
long as such restoration returns the condition of the sign to the same size and
with same wording that it contained prior to the restoration. (Ord. 2017-7-15.
Passed 9-12-17.)
1173.06 EXISTING USE DEEMED CONDITIONAL USE; APPLICATION REQUIRED FOR CHANGE.
   Any lawfully existing use that, at the time of its establishment, was not
classified as a Conditional Use, but which now, because of the passage of this
Zoning Code, or amendment thereto, is listed as a Conditional Use in the Zoning
District in which it is located, shall be deemed without further action to be a
conditional use. Any change, modification, enlargement or alteration of such
use, site development conditions or signs, or change in operations shall only
be permitted upon review and approval according to the procedures for
conditional uses set forth in Chapter
1149.
(Ord. 2017-7-15. Passed 9-12-17.)

CHAPTER 1179
Signs
1179.01   Purposes.
1179.02   Definitions.
1179.03   General regulations.
1179.04   District regulations.
1179.05   Requirements for illuminated signs.
1179.06   Non-conforming status.
 
1179.01  PURPOSES.
   (a)    The purposes of this chapter are to promote the general health,
safety and welfare of the residents of the Village by organizing and
consolidating the existing sign regulations; and modifying existing standards,
as necessary, to assure that all current issues related to signs are addressed.
More specifically, the purposes are to:
      (1)    Promote and protect property values in each of the districts.
      (2)    Provide reasonable and appropriate conditions for identifying
goods sold or produced or services rendered in business and industrial
districts.
      (3)    Control the size, location and design so that the appearance of
permanent signs will be aesthetically harmonious with their surroundings.
      (4)    Eliminate any conflict which would be hazardous between privately
erected signs and traffic control signs and devices.
      (5)    Provide review procedures which enable the Village to
comprehensively evaluate the appropriateness of the sign to the site, building
and surroundings.
      (6)    Assure that signs are located and designed to maintain a safe and
orderly pedestrian and vehicular environment.
   
   (b)    In establishing these purposes, the Village of Boston Heights has
determined that signs which do not comply with these regulations as to type,
size, location, design standards and a limitation on the number of signs in the
Village, are a public nuisance. Furthermore, the appearance of the Village is
marred by an excessive number of oversized and poorly designed signs, and both
residential and business property values are adversely affected, and that
unregulated signs are unduly distracting to motorists and pedestrians, and
thereby create a traffic hazard and reduce the effectiveness of signs needed to
direct the public.
(Ord. 2016-3-2. Passed 5-10-16.)
1179.02 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)    General.
      (1)   Sign means any structure, or natural object such as a tree, bush,
rock, lawn or ground itself, part thereof, or device attached thereto, or
painted or represented thereon which shall be used to attract attention to any
object, product, place, activity, person, institution, organization, or
business, or which shall display or include any letter, word, model, banner,
flag, pennant, insignia, device or representation, used as, or which is in the
nature of an announcement, direction, or advertisement. For the purposes of
this Code, "sign" does not include the flag, pennant, burgee, badge or insignia
of any domestic government or governmental agency.
Signs are an accessory use in all districts and thereby subject to the
definition thereof in Section
1141.02. All signs must be located on the same property as the business or
service advertised by any such sign, except as this Chapter allows for
temporary signs, or except where the Board of Zoning Appeals finds cause for
variance.
      (2)    Sign area or dimensions.
         A.    For a sign that is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise
prepared and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area
dimensions shall include the entire portion within such background or frame.
         B.    For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures, or elements
on a wall or similar surface, or a freestanding sign of irregular shape, the
area of the sign shall encompass a single rectangle or regular geometric shape
that encompasses the perimeter of all the elements in the display.
         C.    The sign area shall include the frame, but shall not include the
pole or other structural support unless the pole or support is illuminated or
otherwise so designated to constitute a display surface or device.
         D.    The height of a freestanding sign shall be measured from the
average finished grade surrounding its point of attachment to the top of the
highest element or point on the supporting pole or structure, whichever is
higher. Determination of the average finished grade shall exclude any mounding
immediately surrounding the point of attachment.
         E.    The height of a wall sign shall be measured from the grade
defined for the building to which it is attached, as per Section
1141.22, to the top of the highest element.
         F.    A sign with two (2) faces shall have the display surfaces
arranged back-to-back and essentially parallel with each other.

length of the building or unit of the building which faces the principal street
or the length of the wall of the building or unit which contains the main
entrance to the uses therein. In the case of an irregular wall surface, a
straight line extended along such wall surface shall be used to measure the
length. Only one outside wall of any business shall be considered its frontage.
      (4)   “Building unit” for the purposes of sign regulation means that
portion of a building which is owned or leased by a single tenant. The length
of unit is that portion of the building so occupied by a single activity and
calculated proportionally in the same manner as building frontage.

activities unrelated to the property upon which the sign or device is located,
whether lawfully permitted or legally nonconforming.

limited time, as regulated by this Chapter.
      (6)    Wall sign means a sign erected essentially parallel to, or painted
on the surface, or on the outside wall of any building, and not extending more
than twelve inches therefrom, and which does not project above the roofline or
beyond the corner of the building. A sign affixed to, or near, a window for the
purposes of being visible to and read from the outside of the building and
containing information typically found on identification or instructional signs
shall, for the purposes of these regulations, be considered a wall sign.
   (c)    Types of Signs; Functional.
      (1)    Directional sign means a sign which has as its only function the
direction of vehicular or pedestrian traffic upon, to or from a premises and
which contains no advertising matter other than the name or symbol for the
business, project, development or activity on those premises.
      (2)    Security sign means a sign that identifies or warns of the
security system for premises.
      (3)    Subdivision sign or project identification sign means a sign

multiple family development, or a commercial, office, industrial park or
subdivision. Such sign in a commercial, office or industrial park may include a
directory of business uses therein.

commercial subdivision for purposes of traffic control, which has been located
within the public right-of-way in accordance with a subdivision plat approved
by the Planning Commission under Chapter

1181.01 PUBLIC PURPOSE.
   (a)   It is hereby determined that the system of streams within the Village
of Boston Heights contributes to the health, safety and general welfare of the
residents and property owners of the Village of Boston Heights. The purpose of
this chapter is to protect and preserve the water quality within streams of the
Village of Boston Heights and to protect residents of the Village of Boston
Heights from property loss and damage because of flooding and other impacts of
the streams. This chapter shall be implemented by controlling uses and
developments within a Riparian Setback that would impair the ability of the
riparian area to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of floodwaters and regulating base flow.
      (2)   Stabilize the banks of streams to reduce bank erosion and the
downstream transport of sediments eroded from stream banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in streams during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling and transforming pollutants already present in streams.
      (4)   Reduce pollutants during periods of high flows by filtering,
settling and transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter streams.
      (5)   Provide areas for natural meandering and lateral movement of stream
channels.
      (6)   Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain diverse
and connected riparian vegetation.
      (7)   Provide high quality habitats with shade and food to a wide array
of wildlife by maintaining diverse and connected riparian vegetation.
      (8)   Benefit the Village of Boston Heights economically by minimizing
encroachment on stream channels and reducing the need for costly engineering
solutions such as dams and riprap, to protect structures and reduce property
damage and threats to the safety of watershed residents, and by contributing to
the scenic beauty and to the environment of the Village of Boston Heights, the
quality of life of the residents of the Village of Boston Heights and
corresponding property values.
      (9)   Protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the
Village of Boston Heights.
   (b)   The following regulation has been enacted to protect these services of
riparian areas by providing reasonable controls governing structures and uses
in riparian setbacks.
(Ord. 10-2006. Passed 5-10-06.)

influences impacts on the stream, the following adjustment for steep slopes
will be integrated into the Riparian Setback formulae for width determination:
 
Average Percent Slope        Width of Setback
15% through 20%              Add 25 feet
Greater than 20% through 25% Add 50 feet
Greater than 25%             Add 100 feet
 
   Average percent slope of the streambank is to be calculated for the area
within the Riparian setback and is to be measured as a line perpendicular to
the stream channel at the location where structures or uses are proposed in the
plan. All of the following measurements are to be performed using County of
Summit Geographical Information system data (1994, 2000). Calculate slope as
follows:
   The change in elevation from the edge of the stream channel to the edge of
the Riparian Setback divided by the horizontal map distance from the edge of
the stream channel to the edge of the Riparian Setback.
      (3)   Where wetlands protected under federal or state law are identified
within the Riparian Setback, the Riparian Setback shall consist of the full
extent of the wetlands plus the following additional setback widths:
         A.   A 50 foot setback extending beyond the outer boundary of a
Category 3 wetlands.
         B.   A 30 foot setback extending beyond the outer boundary of a
Category 2 wetlands.
         C.   No additional setback will be required adjacent to Category 1
wetlands.
      (4)   Wetlands shall be delineated by a qualified professional under
guidelines established by the US Army Corps of Engineers and Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency and the delineation approved by the appropriate agencies. All
wetland delineations shall also include the latest version of the Ohio Rapid
Assessment Method for wetland evaluation approved at the time of application of
the regulations.
      (5)   The applicant shall be responsible for delineating the Riparian
Setback, including any expansions or modifications as required by subsections
(b) through (e) of this section, and identifying this setback on all
subdivisions, land development plans, and/or building permit applications. This
delineation shall be done at the time of application of the preliminary plans,
or all plans that are required, or at the time of submission of any permit
applications. This delineation shall be subject to review and approval by the
Summit SWCD. As the result of this review, the Summit SWCD may require further
studies from the applicant.
      (6)   Prior to any soil disturbing activity, the Riparian Setback shall
be clearly delineated with construction fencing or other suitable material by
the applicant on site, and such delineation shall be maintained throughout
soil-disturbing activities. The delineated area shall be maintained in an
undisturbed state unless otherwise permitted by these regulations. All fencing
shall be removed when a development project is completed.
      (7)   No approvals or permits shall be issued by the Village of Boston
Heights prior to delineation of the Riparian Setback in conformance with these
regulations.
      (8)   Upon completion of an approved subdivision, the Riparian Setback
shall be permanently recorded on the plat records for the County of Summit.

      (Ord. 14-2007. Passed 8-8-07.)
1183.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   The SWP3 must contain a description and location of all appropriate
BMPs for each construction operation. Prior to the start of grading and within
seven days from the start of grubbing the applicant must implement such
controls. The SWP3 must clearly describe for each major construction activity
the appropriate control measures; the general sequence during the construction
process under which the measures will be implemented; and the person(s)
responsible for implementation. The time frame for SWP3 implementation shall be
consistent with the current Ohio EPA NPDES construction permit. No project
subject to this chapter shall commence without a SWP3 or approved by the Summit
SWCD. No project subject to this chapter shall commence without a pre-
construction meeting being held with the Summit SWCD. It will be the
applicant’s responsibility to contact the SWCD.
   (b)   The applicant shall inform all contractors and subcontractors not
otherwise defined as “operators” as defined in the Ohio EPA’s NPDES Permit, who
will be involved in the implementation of the SWP3 of the terms and conditions
of the SWP3. The applicant shall maintain a written document containing the
signatures of all contractors and subcontractors involved in the implementation
of the SWP3 as proof acknowledging that they have reviewed and understand the
conditions and responsibilities of the SWP3. The written document shall be
created and signatures shall be obtained prior to the commencement of work on
the construction site. A copy shall be provided to the Summit SWCD prior to
commencing with the project and on file at the Village of Boston Heights Town
Hall.
   (c)   All projects regardless of the area of disturbance must utilize BMPs
to minimize erosion and off site sedimentation. The controls shall include the
following minimum components:
      (1)   During Active Construction.  
         A.   Non-structural preservation measures: The applicant must make use
of practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing or
grubbing practices.
            1.   Stream protection. The requirements of Chapter
1181 Riparian Setbacks of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Boston
Heights shall be followed.
            2.   Wetland protection. The setback requirements of the Village of
Boston Heights shall be followed in addition to county, state and federal
regulations.
         B.   Erosion control practices. The applicant must make use of erosion
controls that are capable of providing cover over 70% of disturbed soils. A
description of control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after
grading or construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
         C.   Runoff control practices. The applicant must make use of measures
that control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion.
Such practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to
direct flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These
practices shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
         D.   Sediment control practices. The applicant must install structural
practices that shall store runoff, allowing sediments to settle and/or divert
flows away from exposed soils or otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas.
Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap sediment from a
site remaining disturbed for more than 7 days. Such practices may include,
among others, sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet
protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to a
sediment settling pond. All sediment control practices must be capable of
ponding or filtering runoff in order to be considered functional. Earth
diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a sediment control
practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling pond.
         E.   Non-sediment pollution controls. No solid or liquid waste,
including building materials and concrete wash out water shall be discharged in
storm water runoff. The applicant must implement site best management practices
to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris from entering
water resources or wetlands.
         F.   Compliance with other requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent
with applicable state and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic
system regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open
burning and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located
within the development area.
         G.   Trench and ground water control. There shall be no sediment laden
or turbid discharge to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
         H.   Applicant inspections. An initial inspection of all erosion and
sediment control practices shall be conducted by a qualified individual to
certify that the installations comply with the approved SWP3. All controls on
the site shall be inspected by the applicant’s agent at least once every seven
calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half
inch of rain per 24 hour period. The applicant shall assign a qualified
individual to conduct these inspections to ensure that the control practices
are functional and to evaluate whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether
additional control measures are required. Internal inspections and
documentation of corrective actions taken must be made available upon request.
         I.   Maintenance. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization. The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by the Summit SWCD.
            1.   When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement or
installation of erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures
shall be followed:
               a.   When practices require repair or maintenance. If an
inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance,
with the exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or
maintained within three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds
must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
               b.   When practices fail to provide their intended function. If
an inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its intended
function as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control
practice is required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice
must be installed within ten (10) days of the inspection.
               c.   When practices depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If
an inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection
reveals that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must
contain a statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not
needed.
         J.   Final stabilization. All soil disturbing activities are complete
and a uniform perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70 percent coverage
for the area has been established on all unpaved areas and areas not covered by
permanent structures. In addition, all temporary erosion and sediment control
practices have been removed and disposed of in an acceptable manner.
      (2)   Post construction water quality practices.  
         A.   Non-structural water quality practices. Non-structural post
construction best management practices include preservation, planning, or
procedures that direct development away from water resources, or limit creation
of impervious surfaces. Practices such as conservation easements, riparian and
wetland setbacks, and conservation subdivision design are all non-structural
controls.
            1.   All non-structural water quality practices must be protected
from disturbance through the construction phase of the project.
            2.   All non-structural water quality practices must be protected
in perpetuity through the use of appropriate legal tools. All easement or
conservation areas must appear on the final plat and be disclosed to potential
buyers.
         B.   Structural water quality practices. Structural post construction
best management practices are permanent features constructed to provide
treatment of storm water runoff either through storage, filtration or
infiltration.
            1.   All structural water quality practices must be established
prior to the completion of the project. Structural water quality practices
should be made functional once the disturbed areas on site are stabilized. If
detention/retention facilities were used for sediment control during the
development sediments must be removed prior to the basin being used for post
construction storm water quality.
            2.   Maintenance. The post construction water quality practice must
be maintained in perpetuity by those parties identified in the SWP3 or the
Storm Water Management Maintenance Agreement.

1377.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Village Council of Boston Heights, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows;
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The Village of Boston Heights has special flood
hazard areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss
of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Boston Heights as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by Village of Boston Heights.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Summit County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Summit County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective July 20, 2009.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Boston Heights as required by Section
1377.04(c).
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Boston Heights, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 5-2009. Passed 5-13-09.)
1377.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure: A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal: A request for review of the floodplain administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   Base Flood: The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE): The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement: Any areas of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor: See “Lowest Floor.”
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management): Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means:
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: A special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection, or FPE, is the base
flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway:  
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such a wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminary
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio’s inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by Village of Boston Heights historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC
s are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
“manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle”. For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27- 01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction: Structures for which the “start of construction”
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Boston
Heights Flood Insurance Rate Map, February 18, 1981, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,

management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirements to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1377.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1) hereof, prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision,

Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the
Village of Boston Heights, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Boston Heights have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of Boston Heights Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately present the
Village of Boston Heights boundaries, include within such notification a copy
of a map of the Village of Boston Heights suitable for reproduction, clearly
showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the Village of
Boston Heights has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory
authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard.
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas that are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway areas exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1377.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information material related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsections (i)(1)B, items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alternations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
“bankfull stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or

to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with

agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1377.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation

1377.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.

appointed to serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by
Village Code.

Boston Mills Road Boston Heights, Ohio 44236.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.

there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 15 days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing,
notice of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation of any item
appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator’s decision. Such appeal
shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain
Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall
transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which the Floodplain
Administrator’s decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board for a public hearing.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   (EDITOR’S NOTE: Former subsection (d)(1)C. was repealed by
Ordinance 2013-2-4, passed April 10, 2013.)
      (2)   Public hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations,
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsections (d)(2)A. to K. have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal. (Ord. 5-2009. Passed 5-13-09.)
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. The costs thereof shall be the responsibility of the
requesting party. (Ord. 2013-2-4. Passed 4-10-13.)
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Summit County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 5-2009. Passed 5-13-
09.)
1377.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.  
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered

applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1377.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
Section
1377.06(c).
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with Section
1377.06(c).

or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a fourth degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of the Village of Boston Heights. Each day such violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained
shall prevent the Village of Boston Heights from taking such other lawful
action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. The Village of
Boston Heights shall prosecute any violation of these regulations in accordance
with the penalties stated herein. (Ord. 5-2009. Passed 5-13-09.)

1383
1381.01 PURPOSE.
   The Mayor and Council find and declare that improperly maintained and
secured foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health, welfare and
safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect
the aesthetic and economic qualities of the areas within the Village. Further,
difficulties often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition
of foreclosed real property. The Mayor and Council find that there is a
substantial need directly related to the public health, welfare and safety to
comprehensively address these concerns. It is, therefore, the purpose and
intent of this Chapter to establish a registration program for properties that
are in the process of foreclosure or where ownership has been transferred after
foreclosure as a mechanism to protect areas within the Village from becoming
blighted through the lack of adequate maintenance and adequate security of
abandoned properties.
(Ord. 2018-10-8. Passed 12-11-18.)
1381.02 APPLICATION.
      This chapter shall be applicable to all buildings and structures located

Village of the filing of the foreclosure complaint and shall file a complete
copy of the foreclosure complaint with the Village Clerk, for transmittal to
the Zoning Inspector, within ten (10) days after the filing of the complaint.
The required notice to the Village shall be on a form prescribed by the Zoning
Inspector.
   
   (b)    The fee for filing a notice of foreclosure shall be pursuant to the
Fee Schedule established by Section
1101.05 of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Boston Heights, and shall
be paid at the time the notice is filed with the Village Clerk, and on each
anniversary date thereafter so long as the foreclosure case remains pending on
the court's docket.
(Ord. 2018-10-8. Passed 12-11-18.)
1381.04 PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTENANCE.
      (a)    If the building or structure on the property that is the subject
of a foreclosure proceeding is vacant at the time the foreclosure complaint is
filed with a court of competent jurisdiction, then the person, corporation, or
entity filing the foreclosure complaint shall provide the Zoning Inspector the
name, address, and contact information for the person who is responsible for
maintaining the property in conformance with applicable Codified Ordinances of
the Village.
   
   (b)    If the building or structure on the property that is the subject of a
foreclosure proceeding becomes vacant at any time after the foreclosure
complaint is filed with a court of competent jurisdiction, the person or entity
filing the foreclosure complaint shall provide the Zoning Inspector the name,
address and contact information for the person who is responsible for
maintaining the property in conformance with the applicable Codified Ordinances
of the Village.
   (c)    Vacant building shall be defined pursuant to Codified Ordinance

1383.01 PURPOSE.
   The Mayor and Council find and declare that within the Village limits, there
are vacant buildings or structures which are in an unsafe, dangerous or
unsecure condition which need to be made safe and secure. Such buildings or
structures pose a danger to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of
the Village by increasing neighborhood blight, creating fire and other hazards
to adjoining properties, attracting criminal activities, and creating
attractive nuisance to children. It is, therefore, essential to public health
welfare and safety that the Village maintain an accurate registration of all
vacant buildings and structures, and the purpose of this Chapter is to
establish a program for identifying and registering vacant residential,
commercial and industrial buildings within the Village; to determine the
responsibilities of owners of vacant buildings and structures; to speed the
rehabilitation or condemnation of vacant buildings; and to shift the cost of
rehabilitating or condemning vacant buildings from the public to the owners of
the blighted buildings to the extent permitted by law.

   (d)    The height of a Fence shall be measured from four (4) inches above
the established grade line to the highest point of the Fence, including posts
and finials.
   (e)    No Fence erected in a residentially or commercially zoned area shall
have as part of its design or construction metal prongs or spikes, or barbed

as part of its design or construction. This subsection (e) does not prohibit
the placement and use of barbed wire fencing for permitted agricultural uses.
   (f)    A Fence may be constructed along or upon common property lines and
across any utility easement but may not be located within three (3) feet of a
utility box, manhole, or other apparatus that may be used for maintenance of
the utility. However, a gate and/or removable section of fencing may be placed
within this three-(3) foot restriction if the gate or removable section
provides sufficient access to the utility box, manhole, or other apparatus.
When a Fence obstructs access to a utility box, manhole, or other public
apparatus for maintaining utilities, the owner shall be required to remove and
replace such Fence at their expense without remuneration from the Village. This
section shall not prohibit the Village from removing any Fence located in a
utility or drainage easement that obstructs a utility

required building setback and the right-of-way only for the front yard, which
functions as a side yard. The height of the Fence for the second front yard,
which functions as a side yard, can be six feet. Village staff shall determine
which front yard functions as a side yard based on the layout of the lot,
address, and design of the house.
   (h)    Privacy and Chain Link Fences shall be prohibited in the front yards.
   (i)    Any Fence constructed between the required building setback line and

the minimum requirements. However, if a neighbor's Fence, which makes up any
portion of the swimming pool enclosure, is removed for any reason, the property
owner shall be responsible for restoring the swimming pool to an enclosed
state. This restoration shall be performed as soon as possible, but under no
circumstances should it be longer than thirty (30) days from the removal of the
neighbor’s Fence. All Fences shall conform to the following requirements:

not exceed one and three-quarter (1 3/4) inches in width.
         C.   Maximum mesh size for chain link Fences shall not exceed one- and
three-quarter (1 3/4) inch square unless the Fence is provided with slats
fastened at the top or bottom, which reduce the openings to no more than one
and three-quarter (1 3/4) inches.
         D.   In a lattice Fence, the maximum opening formed by the diagonal
members shall be no more than one and three-quarter (1 3/4) inches.
         E.   Spacing between vertical members of a decorative metal Fence
shall be no more than four (4) inches, and any gate shall have no opening

forty-two (42) inches or more above the minimum adjacent grade, and the
swimming pool is equipped with a removable ladder or a ladder that folds up and
locks in an upright position when the swimming pool is not in use, or the steps
or ladder is surrounded by a Fence as described in this subsection (j)(1), then
additional fencing will not be required. If an above-ground swimming pool has a
Fence at the top of the swimming pool, the maximum vertical clearance between
the top of the swimming pool and the bottom of the Fence shall not exceed four
(4) inches. A thirty-six (36)-inch minimum guardrail conforming to the
Residential Code of Ohio is required for any porch, balcony, or raised floor
surface located more than thirty (30) inches above the floor or grade below.
   (k)    A hot tub or spa constructed or residing on any residential property,

1346.
   (l)    Temporary Snow Fences not exceeding forty-eight (48) inches in height
may be erected in non-residential districts, properties within residential
districts where the plot exceeds three (3) acres, and properties immediately
adjacent to commercial properties without a permit between November 15 of any
year and the following March 31 to control snow drifting across sidewalks,
driveways, and roadways. Snow Fences may extend beyond or be located in front
of the required building setback line not more than one-half the distance
between the required building setback line and the corresponding street public
right-of-way. Snow Fences shall not be erected or located that would:
      (1)    Hinder access to the residence by vehicles and personnel
responding to a fire, police, or medical emergency; or
      (2)    Cause snow to accumulate in a manner that would encroach upon or
block any public right-of-way, hinder the proper operation of Village snow
removal equipment, or block access to or cause damage to adjacent properties.
   (m)    Fences shall be maintained in good condition and shall be
structurally sound, safe, and attractively finished at all times. All fencing,
regardless of the type or what zoning district it is located in, shall have the
finished side facing adjacent properties and or the right-of-way. Any repairs
or replacements ordered by the Village shall be made within thirty (30) days of
the date of the order. Grounds between Fences and property lines and between
Fences shall be well maintained at all times. Any Fence shall be designed,
constructed, and finished so the supporting members thereof shall face the
property of the Fence's owner. If a Fence does not meet these standards, the
property owner with the Fence shall be subject to the penalty in Section
