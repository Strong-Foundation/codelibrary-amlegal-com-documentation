EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action

(ORC 1.23)

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended. (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance. (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.09 TRANSITION FROM CITY TO VILLAGE; INTERPRETATION.
   EDITOR’S NOTE: In 1991 Mingo Junction changed from a City to a Village under
Ohio law. Therefore, references within the Codified Ordinances to City should
be interpreted to mean Village and references to City officials/departments
should be interpreted to mean the comparable Village official/department, i.e.,
Law Director - Solicitor.
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

   (b)   Substance Abuse Policy, Purpose Applicability, and Rule Making

efficient government services to the public. Village employees are a valuable
and important resource and it is therefore the Village's policy to provide a
healthy, safe, and satisfying working environment for its employees as well as
to staff that working environment only with employees who are fit for duty.
Federal laws and regulations have been adopted which require the Village to
implement a drug, controlled substance, and alcohol screening program for
operators of a commercial motor vehicle and for employees who engage in certain
safety sensitive occupations. Accordingly, a requirement for entering Village
employment, retaining Village employment or advancing in the administrative
service of the Village into positions to which the above mentioned Federal
regulations apply shall henceforth be that such an employee is fit for duty in
the additional sense that he or she is free of drug dependence, not a user of
nor a trafficker in controlled substances or drugs, and free of alcohol
dependency or use such that his or her normal mental or physical capabilities
are not impaired. In meeting these goals, it is further the Village's policy
to:
         A.   Assure that covered employees operating a covered vehicle with or
without a commercial driver's license are fit for duty and able to perform
their assigned duties in a safe, productive, healthy, and unimpaired manner:
         B.   Create a workplace free from the adverse effects of drug,
alcohol, and substance abuse:
         C.   Prohibit the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing,
possession or use of alcohol, drugs or controlled substances, among persons
entrusted with covered vehicles or persons employed by the Village by contract
to engage in work involving the operation of a covered vehicle.
      (2)   Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to assure that covered
employees who operate covered vehicles are fit for duty; to eliminate, if
possible, the risk to the Village posed by the use of alcohol, drugs, and
controlled substances by covered employees while operating covered vehicles;
and to maintain a workplace free of alcohol abuse, controlled substance use or
drug abuse. It is further the Village's purpose to detect, identify and remove
from duty those operating a covered vehicle because they are not fit for duty.
However, it is not the purpose of this policy to warrant or to guarantee to the
public at large or other employees of the Village who are injured by a covered
employee that the Village has detected or will in every instance detect that a
violation of this policy has occurred before some injurious result occurs and
it is not the purpose of this policy to create an express or implied warranty
on the part of the Village to the public at large or other employees that all
covered employees are free from alcohol abuse, drug misuse, or controlled
substance use.
      (3)   Applicability. This section shall apply to covered employees when
going to or from work, when going to a work site, when preparing to perform
work at a site, when performing work for the Village, when on a break or at
lunch while in the course of performing work, after concluding the performance
of work at a site but before departing the work site, when returning to the
Village facilities following departure from a work site, and when on Village
property regardless of work status.
      (4)   Rule making Authority. The Village Administrator or his designee is
hereby authorized to adopt such rules and regulations as well as create forms,
documents, and procedures for the implementation of this Chapter. Such
activities as are undertaken under authority of this subsection shall be
consistent with this Chapter and consistent with the relevant Federal laws and
regulations governing substance abuse testing as the same are applicable to the
Village.
   (c)   Substances for Which Tests is to be Conducted. Tests shall be
conducted pursuant to the provisions of this section for alcohol, any
controlled substance or drug as said terms are defined herein and whose misuse
or abuse is addressed in this section.
   (d)   Grounds for Substance Abuse Testing. All covered employees shall be
subject to substance abuse testing of either urine, breath, and or blood under
the following circumstances:
      (1)   Pre-employment or Pre-promotion Testing. All applicants whose names
are certified for appointment or promotion to a position whose incumbent would
be a covered employee shall be notified by the Department of Civil Service upon
certification that a test for drug, alcohol and controlled substance use must
precede their appointment or promotion into covered employment. A certified
applicant who is tentatively selected for appointment or promotion by the
appointing authority and who then refuses, declines, or fails to submit to a
drug, alcohol and controlled substance test upon notice to do so by the
Director of Civil Service and Personnel shall be deemed to be medically
unqualified for covered employment and shall not be appointed or promoted into
covered employment. An applicant, who is selected for appointment or promotion
and is tested for drug, alcohol and controlled substance use prior to
appointment or promotion to covered employment, must receive a satisfactory
test result before a Personnel Action Form affecting the job action is executed
and delivered to the Director of Civil Service and Personnel by the appointing
authority.
      (2)   Reasonable suspension testing.   Covered employees shall be subject
to a fitness for duty evaluation, which shall include appropriate urine, blood,
and or breath testing when a supervisor has reasonable suspicion that
controlled substance use, drug abuse or alcohol use is adversely affecting a
covered employee's job performance. A reasonable suspicion referral for testing
shall be made on the basis of documented objective facts and circumstances
which are consistent with the long or short-term effects of substance abuse.
"Reasonable suspicion" means an apparent state of existing facts, circumstances
or information which result from an inquiry by the supervisor or from a
credible source which would induce a reasonably intelligent and prudent person
to reasonably believe the covered employee is under the influence of or using
controlled substances, drugs, or alcohol. Reasonable suspicion determinations
leading to a substance abuse test shall be made by a covered employee's
supervisor who shall be reasonably trained in the detection of the signs and
symptoms of substance abuse or who is reasonably familiar with the same, and
who reasonably concludes a covered employee's work, mental faculties, or
physical capabilities are presently being impaired or affected by substance
abuse. Examples of reasonable suspicion include, but are not limited to, the
following:
         A.   Adequate documentation of unsatisfactory work performance or on
the job behavior for unexplained reasons;
         B.   Physical signs and symptoms consistent with substance use:
         C.   Evidence of the manufacture, distribution, dispensing,
possession, or use or controlled substances, drugs, alcohol or other prohibited
substances;
         D.   Occurrence of a serious or potentially serious accident that may
have been caused by human error; and
         E.   Fights (to mean physical contact), assault, menacing, stalking,
or threatening behavior, and flagrant disregard or violation of established
safety, security or other operating procedures.
   Reasonable suspicion shall not be based solely upon a covered employee's
possession of alcohol, particularly unopened containers of alcohol or
possession of alcohol by trained medical personnel for purposes of medical
treatment. Possession of alcohol with observations concerning the employee's
appearance, speech, or abnormal conduct are necessary. Possession of a
controlled substance shall be reasonable suspicion for requiring a controlled
substance test. Possession of drugs shall not be grounds for a reasonable
suspicion test if the covered employee can:
         A.   Satisfactorily explain to his or her supervisor the reason for
possession of the drug,
         B.   Identify the physician who prescribed the drug for the covered
employee (this information can be verified to the supervisor by the pharmacy
filling the prescription or the prescribing physician) and
         C.   The use of drugs has not affected or impaired the employee's work
performance. The fact a satisfactory explanation is provided shall not negate
reasonable suspicion if the covered employee's mental or physical abilities
appear to be affected or impaired by the drug. Observations leading to a
reasonable suspicion substance abuse test shall be reduced to writing or
otherwise preserved within a reasonable time by the supervisor making the
decision to require such a test. Once a covered employee has been notified that
a reasonable suspicion test will be conducted, the test shall take place within
two (2) hours of the notice. If the test is not conducted within two hours, a
written record shall be made stating the reasons the test was not promptly
administered. If the test has hot been conducted within eight (8) hours
following the notification, no test shall be administered and a record shall be
made of why the test was not administered within eight (8) hours.
      (3)   Post-accident testing. A covered employee (as well as any employee
operating a covered vehicle despite not having a commercial driver's license)
shall be subject to urine, blood or breath testing when a covered vehicle is
involved in a collision or when control over a covered vehicle is unexplainably
(for non-mechanical reasons) lost. By way of illustration, but not limitation,
an unexplained loss of control of a covered vehicle or a collision between a
covered vehicle and a person that results in a fatality or injuries requiring
medical attention; a collision between a covered vehicle and another vehicle or
train resulting in material damage, a collision between a covered vehicle and a
stationary or moving object resulting in material damage shall be grounds for a
post accident substance abuse test. Material damage for purposes of this
subsection means damage estimated to be equal to or greater than four hundred
dollars ($400.00). The determination of whether material damage has occurred
shall be made by a supervisor other than one who was within the covered vehicle
when the triggering event occurred or witnessed that event. The filing of
criminal or traffic charges as a result of a triggering event shall not be
necessary to require a covered employee or a non-covered employee operating a
covered vehicle to submit to a post-accident test. Reasonable suspicion that
the operator of a covered vehicle involved in a triggering event has used
drugs, alcohol or controlled substances is immaterial to the requirement herein
of a post-accident test. Postaccident testing shall not be permitted to delay
the administration of necessary medical attention to injured covered employees.
Once a covered employee has been notified that a post accident test will be
conducted, it shall take place within two (2) hours of this notice. If the test
is not conducted within two hours, a written record shall be made stating the
reasons the test was not promptly administered. If the test has not been
conducted within eight (8) hours following the notification, no test shall be
administered and a record shall be made of why the test was not administered
within eight (8) hours. Covered employees or non-covered employees, who operate
a covered vehicle that is involved in an accident resulting in material damage
or in an unexplained loss of control and who are so seriously injured that a
substance abuse test cannot be obtained within the requisite two (2) hour
period shall execute a medical consent form allowing an analysis of any
adequate substitute bodily fluids taken within two hours of the triggering
event for the purposes of medical treatment to be used for analysis exist shall
cause the employee to be deemed medically unqualified for duty such that a
substance abuse test is required before the covered employee may return to
work. The Village may, but shall not be required to, substitute, accept, and
rely upon the result of any blood, urine, or breath test conducted pursuant to
Ohio’s implied consent statute as an accurate and reliable substance abuse test
for purposes of this Chapter provided the test is an accurate and reliable
means for testing for alcohol, drug and controlled substance abuse. A covered
employee or a non-covered employee who operates a covered vehicle involved in
an accident, unless injured so seriously that immediate medical attention is
required, must make his or her whereabouts known to his immediate supervisor
for purposes of remaining available for a possible substance abuse test for the
balance of the work day or eight hours after the accident, whichever is later.
A covered employee subject to test thereunder who cannot be located following
an accident for the balance of the work day or for eight hours after the
accident shall be deemed medically unqualified for duty and shall not be
permitted to return to work until he or she submits to a substance abuse test.
      (4)   Random and unannounced testing. Covered employees shall be
subjected to random, unannounced urine, blood and or breath testing for the
purpose of detecting substance abuse. The process used for selection of a
covered employee(s) to take a substance abuse test shall be determined by the
Village Administrator, provided, however, that the selection process must yield
a random result so that no predictable pattern of identifying the covered
employee to be tested will exist, and provided further, that random testing
shall be conducted on an intermittent schedule so that predictable time frames
when tests will be administered cannot be ascertained. A covered employee
randomly selected for an unannounced substance abuse test shall immediately
proceed to the designated sampling location to provide a test sample. A covered
employee who reuses or fails to travel to the collection site or who refuses or
fails to provide a test sample for substance abuse test analysis within a
reasonable time after being randomly selected for test shall be deemed
medically unqualified for employment and shall be relieved of duty without pay
until a sample is provided. Covered employees selected for testing who are not
at work when selected shall be passed over if they have been tested within the
previous three hundred and sixty five days, and otherwise shall be instructed
to report for testing immediately upon their return to work. The number of
random unannounced substance abuse tests conducted annually shall equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the number of covered employee positions, whether
vacant or filled, in the administrative service of the Village. Private
contractors shall be subject to a similar number of tests based on the number
of covered employees they utilize under a contract with the Village.
      (5)   Return to duty testing. All covered employees who previously
received an unsatisfactory result on a substance abuse test, including any
second or confirming test if one was conducted, must undergo return to duty
substance abuse testing before returning to work and be evaluated and treated
if necessary, for substance abuse, and be released to duty by a competent
medical practitioner before returning to work. Covered employees who are
subject to return to duty testing shall also be subject to six or more random
and unannounced substance abuse tests, to be conducted when the covered
employee is at work, during the first twelve months following his or her re-
entry into employment separate and apart from their exposure to random and
unannounced testing. A successful return to duty test for alcohol shall be a
result of 0.02 or less. A negative screen for drugs and controlled substances
shall be considered a successful test for return to duty purposes.
      (6)   Employee requested testing. Any employee who questions the results
of a substance abuse test required or administered pursuant to subsections (a)
through (e) hereof may request that a confirming test in addition to an initial
test be performed. This test may be conducted by the same or a different
testing facility, provided the facility is certified by DHHS to meet 29 CFR
Part 40 requirements. If possible, the testing shall be conducted with the same
specimen (on a split sample if such exists) that was originally submitted to
the Village's laboratory. All costs for tests requested by an employee are to
paid for by the employee.
   (e)   Substance Abuse Testing Procedures and Disclosure.  
      (1)   Substance abuse testing shall be conducted using test procedures
and analysis techniques that are designed to produce a scientifically accurate
and reliable result and efforts shall be made to utilize only laboratory
facilities which have been approved by the DHHS when it is reasonably possible
to do so without delaying the result of the test. Consistent with obtaining an
accurate and reliable result, the Village affirms the need to protect
individual dignity, privacy and confidentiality throughout the testing process.
Personal data regarding the drug testing program shall be released only to
those persons who have a bona fide need to know the information for proper
administration of the anti-drug program in accordance with 49 CFR Section
40.81.
      (2)   For purposes of carrying out its substance abuse testing program
for drugs and controlled substances through urinalysis, the Village hereby
adopts, as if fully rewritten and incorporated here (including its appendices),
the provisions of 49 Code of Federal Regulations Part 40 entitled "Procedures
for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs" and more specifically
designated "Subject B Drug Testing", as the same were promulgated effective
October 14, 1994.
      (3)   For purposes of carrying out its substance abuse testing program
for alcohol by means of breath testing device for covered employees not covered
by Federal laws and regulations mandating the substance abuse testing of
operators of commercial motor vehicles, the Village of Mingo Junction hereby
adopts, as if fully rewritten and incorporated here (including its appendices),
the provisions of 49 Code of Federal Regulations Part 40 entitled "Procedures
For Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs" and more specifically
designated as "Subpart C- Alcohol Testing", as the same were promulgated
effective October 14, 1994.
      (4)   For purposes of carrying out the substance abuse testing program
mandated by the United States government for commercial motor vehicles
operating in interstate commerce, the Village of Mingo Junction hereby adopts,
as if fully rewritten and incorporated herein (including its appendices), the
provisions of 49 Code of Federal Regulations Part 382 entitled "Controlled
Substances and Alcohol Use and Testing" and more specifically designated
"Subpart A - General", “Subpart B - Prohibitions", “Subpart C - Tests
Required", “Subpart D - Handling of Test Results, Record retention and
Confidentiality", and Subpart F - Alcohol Misuse and Controlled Substance Use
Information, Training and Referral", as the same were promulgated effective
October 14, 1994.
   (f)   Refusal or Failure to Provide Test Sample; Unsatisfactory Test
Result.  
      (1)   Any covered employee who is subject to a substance abuse test under
this section and who is informed, orally or in writing, to submit to a
substance abuse test shall provide a sample adequate for initial and confirming
substance abuse testing. Samples which are provided in an acceptable fashion
and to an appropriate container at the testing facility, which sample(s) are
then lost, lost by breakage, misplaced, mislabeled, mishandled, or contaminated
by the testing facility or its employees so as to be scientifically unreliable
shall nevertheless be deemed to be a sample.
      (2)   Refusal or failure to provide a sample adequate for initial and
confirming testing within a reasonable time, or the refusal or failure of a
covered employee who is notified to provide a substance abuse test sample to
immediately appear for testing, shall cause the covered employee to be deemed
medically unfit for duty and to be relieved of duty without pay.
      (3)   If a substance abuse test indicates the presence of controlled
substances, drugs or an impermissible level of alcohol in the covered
employee's system, the employee shall be deemed medically unfit for duty, he or
she shall be relieved of duty, and he or she shall be subject to disciplinary
action.
      (4)   No covered employee shall be permitted to perform safety sensitive
function or engage in the operation of a vehicle whose operation requires a
CDL:
         A.   When test results indicate an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or
greater,
         B.   Within four hours after using alcohol,
         C.   While using alcohol on the job,
         D.   During the eight (8) hours following an accident if the covered
employee's involvement has not been discounted as a contributing factor in the
accident or until the covered employee is tested for substance abuse and
achieves a satisfactory result, or
         E.   If the covered employee refuses to submit to required substance
abuse tests. Any covered employee who violates any of these prohibitions shall
be removed from safety sensitive functions until he or she has met the
conditions for returning to a safety sensitive function by providing a
satisfactory test. If a covered employee is found to have an alcohol
concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 or if the covered employee
is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, as indicated by behavior,
speech and performance indicators of alcohol misuse, and a reasonable suspicion
alcohol test result cannot be obtained, the covered employee will have to be
removed from safety sensitive duties for eight (8) hours or until a test result
below 0.02 is obtained.
   (g)   Conditions for Return to Employment Following a Postive Test. Covered
employees who re-enter the administrative service of the Village or return to
private employment on a project undertaken by the Village following an
unsatisfactory substance abuse test result shall be subject to the conditions
which may include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   A release to work statement from an approved treatment specialist;
      (2)   A negative return to duty test for drugs, controlled substances and
or alcohol;
      (3)   An agreement to periodic testing for one year;
      (4)   A statement of expected work-related behavior; and
      (5)   An agreement to follow specified after care requirements with the
understanding that violation of the re-entry contract is grounds for further
discipline.
   (h)   Rules for Village Contractors. Private parties employed by the Village
to engage in activities which will extend over ninety (90) or more days in a
three hundred and sixty-five consecutive day period and involve activities for
which the Federal regulations require substance abuse testing, private
employers who employ persons who provide safety sensitive functions for the
Village, and private employers who are contractually engaged by the Village to
operate vehicles which require the operator of the vehicle to possess a CDL
shall adopt an anti-drug policy which contains the same provisions as this
Chapter with respect to prohibited conduct and substance abuse testing. No
contractor's employee who is in violation of this Chapter may be employed on
Village property or operate a vehicle whose operator must possess a CDL on a
Village contracted project. Private employers under contract with the Village
which subjects its employees to substance abuse testing may, at the sole
discretion of the Village and at the contractor's expense, participate in the
Village's substance abuse testing program, with the test results being referred
to the contractor's management for appropriate personnel action.
   (i)   General Rules and Prohibitions.
      (1)   No covered employee of the Village shall ingest, take or use, and
covered employees of the Village shall be disciplined for ingesting, taking, or
using any prescription drug or controlled substance unless prescribed by a
person licensed to practice medicine.
      (2)   Employees who are required to take prescription medicine which
could affect their fitness for duty shall notify their immediate supervisor of
the medication prescribed and present proof of possession of a prescription for
the same.
      (3)   Any statutory defined illegal activity by an employee of the
Village or an employee of a contractor of the Village involving drugs,
controlled substances or alcohol by an employee, whether during or outside
Village employment shall be grounds for discipline.
      (4)   All Village property shall be subject to inspection at any time
without notice. Property includes, but is not limited to Village owned
vehicles, desks, containers, files and storage lockers.
      (5)   An employee who believes that another employee is using drugs or
controlled substances or alcohol in violation of this section, in an illegal
fashion, or is under the influence of drugs, controlled substances, or alcohol
shall report the same immediately to his or her supervisor and those who do not
report such facts and circumstances immediately to their supervisor shall
themselves be subject to discipline for neglect of duty.
      (6)   Refusal of a covered employee to take a drug test provided for by
this section shall result in immediate suspension from Village service without
pay pending disciplinary action if the supervisor observes what appear to be
the characteristics of drug misuse, controlled substance use, or alcohol
misuse.
   (j)   Satisfactory Substance Abuse Test Result. A satisfactory result shall
be considered to be a negative drug and or substance abuse test, whether such
test be initial or conforming. A satisfactory alcohol test shall be considered
to be a breath alcohol level of 0.02 or less. A breath alcohol test which is
0.04 or less shall not be disqualifying if the applicant, at a time randomly
selected by the Director of Personnel within the next seventy-two hours,
provides a satisfactory breath test of 0.02 or less on an identical test
device. An unsatisfactory result shall be considered a test result other than
as described above or an inexcusable failure or refusal to provide a substance
abuse test sample. An employee or an applicant for employment may present a
current prescription for a drug as justification for any positive drug test
result and be considered to have obtained a satisfactory result, provided the
dosage prescribed is not deemed to be of such a nature as to impair the
applicant's faculties if taken as prescribed.

      (14)   Probable Cause: Suspicion based on knowledge sufficient to induce
a prudent and cautious man to believe an employee has engaged in illegal drug
usage, drug abuse or misuse, or is currently under the influence of alcohol or
drugs while on the job. Probable Cause of drug abuse, or misuse or alcohol
misuse may be based upon behavioral and/or performance factors which include,
but are not limited to the following:
         A.   Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of drug or

         D.   Evidence that an employee has tampered with a previous drug test;
         E.   Facts or circumstances developed in the course of an authorized
investigation of an accident or unsafe working practice.
   (b)   Basis for Ordering an Employee to be Tested for Drug or Alcohol Abuse
or Misuse.
      (1)   At an unannounced time once each calendar quarter the employer may
randomly test covered employees, exclusive of seasonal employees, as part of
its random testing program for Village employees in which no more than twelve
and one-half percent (12 1/2%) of such employees are tested. Such random
testing shall use the testing procedures outlined in sub-section C below and
all other procedures followed shall not conflict with other sections of this
item.
      (2)   In addition to random testing, covered employees may be tested for
drug abuse or alcohol use when there is probable cause to believe the employee
to be tested is using or abusing drugs or under the influence of alcohol while
at work. Such probable cause must be based on specific, articulable facts,
which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably
warrant drug testing. In addition, covered employees may be randomly tested for
drug abuse during working hours under any of the following conditions:
         A.   Upon return to duty after participation in a drug abuse
rehabilitation program regardless of the duration of the program, the employee
shall be required to undergo six (6) urine tests within the two year period
starting with the date of return to duty.
         B.   Following any critical incident in which an employee was a party.
   (c)   Substance Testing.
      (1)   Drug testing procedures. All Drug Screening tests shall be
conducted by laboratories certified by the Department of Health and Human
Services (DHHS) or certified by a DHHS recognized certification program. No
test shall be considered positive until it has been confirmed by a gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry full scan test or equivalent. The procedures
utilized by the employer and testing laboratory shall include an evidentiary
chain of custody control. All samples collected shall be contained in three (3)
separate containers for use in the prescribed testing procedures. All
procedures shall be outlined in writing and this outline shall be followed in
all situations arising under this article.
      (2)   Alcohol testing procedures. Alcohol testing shall be done in
accordance with the law of the State of Ohio to detect drivers operating a
motor vehicle under the influence. A positive result shall be .08% and shall
entitle the employer to proceed with sanctions as set forth in this section.
      (3)   Urine samples. Each step in the collecting and processing of the
urine specimens shall be documented to establish procedural integrity and the
chain of evidence. Specimen samples shall be sealed, labeled and checked
against the identity of the employee to ensure the results match the employee
tested. Samples shall be stored in a secure and refrigerated atmosphere until
tested or delivered to the testing lab representative.
      (4)   Testing procedure. Testing of samples will only be conducted by
National Institute of Drug abuse (NIDA) certified laboratories. The testing or
processing phase shall consist of a two-step procedure:
         A.   Initial Screening Step.
         B.   Confirmation Step.
   The urine sample is first tested using a screening procedure. A specimen
testing positive will undergo an additional confirmatory test. An initial
positive report will not be considered positive, rather it will be classified
as confirmation pending. Where a positive report is received, urine specimens
shall be maintained under secure storage for a period of not less than one (1)
year. Any sample which has been adulterated or is shown to be a substance other
than urine shall be reported as such. All test results shall be evaluated by
suitably trained medical or scientific personnel prior to being reported. All
unconfirmed positive test records shall be destroyed by the laboratory. Test
results shall be treated with the same confidentiality as all medical records
under the laws of the State of Ohio.
      (5)   Confirmatory testing.  
         A.   If a drug screening test is positive, a confirmatory test shall
be conducted utilizing the fluid from no more than two (2) of the three (3)
containers collected in the manner prescribed above.
         B.   In the event the second test confirms the results of the first
test, the employer may proceed with the sanctions as set forth in this item.
         C.   In the event that the second test contradicts the result of the
first test, the employer may request a third test in accordance with the
procedures prescribed above. The results of this test, if positive, shall allow
the employer to proceed with sanctions as set forth in this item. If the
results are negative, no sanctions shall be imposed.
         D.   In the event that any two (2) test results are positive, the
employee is entitled to have the sample in the third container tested in the
manner prescribed above at the employee's expense. The results of this test,
whether positive or negative, shall be determinative.
      (6)   Payment of Testing Costs. Costs of all drug screening testing and
confirmation tests shall be borne by the employer except that any test
initiated at the request of the employee shall be at the employee's expense.
   (d)   Test Results. The results of the testing shall be delivered to the
employer and the employee tested. An employee whose confirmation result is
positive shall have the right to request a certified copy of the testing
results in which the vendor shall affirm that the test results were obtained
using the approved protocol methods. The employee shall provide a signed
release for disclosure of the testing results. A representative for the
bargaining unit shall have a right of access to the results upon request to the
employer with the employee's consent.
   (e)   Disciplinary Action.  
      (1)   If random testing required by this item has produced a positive
result, and this positive result is the first positive result involving this
employee, the employee shall be referred to rehabilitation and detoxification
programs as appropriate, in lieu of discipline. If the other types of testing
required by this section have produced a positive result, the employer may take
disciplinary action for the act that caused the employer to require the test as
appropriate and for just cause, and/or require the employee to participate in
any rehabilitation or detoxification program that is covered by the employee's
health insurance. An employee shall be allowed to use sick time, compensatory
days, vacation leave, and personal leave days for a period of the
rehabilitation or detoxification program. If no such leave credits are
available the employee shall be placed on medical leave of absence without pay
for the period of the rehabilitation or detoxification program.
      (2)   Upon completion of such program, and upon demonstrating that the
employee is no longer abusing a substance, the employee may be returned to his
former position. Such employee may be subject to random retesting upon his
return to work for a period of two (2) years from the date of his return to
work. Any employee in a rehabilitation or detoxification program in accordance
with this item will not lose any seniority or benefits, should it be necessary
for the employee to be placed on medical leave of absence without pay for a
period not to exceed ninety (90) days.
      (3)   Refusal to submit to a drug test, or adulteration of, or switching
a urine sample, may be independent grounds for discipline.
   (f)   Voluntary Participation in a Dependency Program.  
      (1)   An employee may of his own volition, even if not ordered to do so,
undergo a drug and/or alcohol screening test if he is involved in an on duty
incident or accident involving bodily injury, extensive property damage, or
death. Testing done under these circumstances will be treated in the same
manner as if the employee had been ordered to undergo screening.
      (2)   Employees who may be drug or alcohol dependent are encouraged to
voluntarily seek professional assistance through a treatment program. Voluntary
assistance should be sought before the drug abuse affects job performance and/
or endangers fellow employees or members of the public.
   (g)   Return to Work.  
      (1)   Should permission to return to duty following rehabilitative
treatment become an issue, the employee shall be required to actively continue
in a recognized abuse program monitored by the care provider and/or a qualified
medical professional and shall be required to undergo six (6) urine tests
within the two (2) year period starting from the date of return to duty.
      (2)   If the employee refuses to undergo rehabilitation or
detoxification; if he tests positive during a re-testing within two (2) years
after his return to work from such a program; or if an employee who returns to
duty following rehabilitative treatment is, within two (2) years found to be in
violation of this policy; or if an employee is found to be in violation of this
policy for a third time; he/she may be terminated. The right to contest the
discipline shall be limited to due process and not the level of discipline
imposed.
      (3)   Drug abuse, or participation in any drug abuse rehabilitation
program will not preclude disciplinary action against members for any law or
rule violation which may be connected in part with drug abuse, even if a
rehabilitation program is voluntarily undertaken.
   (h)   Testing Labs. A list of two testing laboratories shall be maintained
by the employer. These laboratories shall conduct any testing directed by the
employer.
   (i)   Confidentiality. All test results and actions taken under or pursuant

(Ord. 1996-38. Passed 8-8-96.)
165.26 POLICY REGARDING VILLAGE PROVIDED VEHICLES.
   (a)   Marking. All Village-provided vehicles will be marked with the name of
the department and “VILLAGE OF MINGO JUNCTION”. Marking requirements do not
apply to vehicles of the Police Department which are used for investigative
purposes.
   (b)   Vehicles Subject to Valuation for Personal Use; Assignment Generally.
The Village Administrator is responsible for assigning vehicles to either
employees or positions. Vehicles assigned by the Village Administrator may be
used for Village business, commuting to and from the employee’s Village work-
site and home, and incidental personal business during a commuting trip.
Carrying passengers who are not Village employees, and also persons who are not
directly associated with Village business, is not permitted.
      (1)   Method of assignment. The method of assignment of vehicles will be
as follows:
         A.   The department head will submit a request to the Village
Administrator to assign a vehicle to a specific position as the need arises.
The department head will inform the liaison committee that a request has been
made.
         B.   Requests will be approved or rejected by the Village
Administrator, and the Village Administrator will reevaluate all assignments
each January. Assignments will be based on a review and in consideration of one
(1) or more of the following criteria:
            1.   Equipment. Special equipment which is installed (e.g. two- way
radio, siren, light bar).
            2.   Work call-in. The employee is regularly called to return to
work or to respond to emergencies.
            3.   Potential damage to vehicle. Materials are transported which
may damage a vehicle.
            4.   High mileage. The assignment of a vehicle results in a savings
to the Village when compared to mileage reimbursement.
      (2)   Valuation for personal use. Income tax valuation and withholding
methods will be based on Internal Revenue Service Regulations and Code and will
be promulgated by administrative procedures.
   (c)   Utility and Pool Vehicles. Department heads may assign certain Village
vehicles to employees or positions as follows:
      (1)   Department heads may assign utility vehicles equipped for special
work which are not suitable for passenger transportation (e.g., dump trucks,
cherry pickers, and forklifts). Utility vehicles will not be used for commuting
or personal business.
      (2)   Department heads may assign vehicles from a department pool. Pool
vehicles are not permanently assigned to an employee or position, are
frequently used by several employees, are garaged or parked on Village
property, and will not be used for commuting or personal business.
However, a department head may occasionally assign a pool vehicle loan employee
for work purposes which include commuting as required for specific work
assignments of short duration (e.g. an evening meeting, or distant early
morning appointment). When so assigned the vehicle may be garaged and/or parked
at the employee’s home. Pool vehicles will not be used for personal business.
   (d)   Vehicles in Police Department and Fire Department’s Office. These
vehicles are assigned by the department head following the criteria set forth
by that department. The vehicles are used at the discretion of the department
head while the employee is on-call or on duty. When the employee is not on-call
or on-duty, the vehicle will not be used for personal business.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the
ORC, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the ORC and the use is not consistent, then the use of the
tenn in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall
control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the ORC.
   (B)    The singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall
include the feminine and the genderneutral.
   (C)    As used in this chapter:

taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
         (a)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal
taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income.
         (b)    Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (C)(1)(a) of this section, but excluding that portion

         (c)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of

an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;

other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax

or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
Village of Mingo Junction. The amended return shall be filed on a form required

   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the period

that division. lf the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by Mingo Junction. A request filed under this division shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
182.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund

assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board

entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.

   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through a lternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Village of Mingo Junction
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail.
The assessment shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment
and include the following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)( 1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to wnich the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeaJ an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Mingo Junction
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(l)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.

appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer without notification to
the chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However,
when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall

removal of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief, or
state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
subsection (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle
by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible

vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;

the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.

motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to

right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. (ORC

303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor

that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-
two hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail

of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.

as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation

court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.

      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
or a combination of them as described in this section when a person submits to
a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request of a law
enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine sample is
obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered nurse, an
emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical technician-
paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall withdraw a
blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, controlled
substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the
whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does not apply to
the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood
under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this subsection, if in
that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person would be endangered
by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the

under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been

this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a

Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as
determined by publications of the national automobile dealer’s association. The
proceeds from any fine imposed under this subsection shall be distributed in
accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)

with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community
service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an offender to complete a
term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect
criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person

the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

353.01 DEFINITIONS.
   The following words and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them:
   (a)   “Parking meter” means a mechanical device installed for the regulation
of parking by lawful authority. Each parking meter shall contain a slot for the
deposit of lawful coin of the United States and a receptacle for receiving and
storing such coin. Each parking meter shall display brief directions as to its
operation and the value of lawful coin required to be deposited. Each parking
meter shall contain a timing mechanism which shall indicate either a balance of
legal parking time or overtime parking by an appropriate signal at the
expiration of such lawful time.
   (b)   “Parking meter space” means a space within a parking meter area, which
is designated for the parking of a single vehicle by marked lines on the curb
or paved surface area adjacent to a parking meter. Posted notice on the meter
or on signs shall indicate the maximum consecutive parking time limit during
which a vehicle may be legally parked in a particular parking meter space and
the days and hours when the requirement to deposit lawful coin shall apply.
353.02 PARKING WITHIN MARKED LINES OF METER SPACE.

directions on the meter. Such person is not required to deposit a coin in a
meter which indicates a balance of unused legal parking time left by the
previous occupant of the space, so long as his occupancy of the space does not
exceed the indicated unused parking time. The parking meter space may be
lawfully occupied by such vehicle during the balance of legal parking time
shown on the meter provided such occupancy does not exceed the established
maximum time limit.

meter or fail to set the timing mechanism in operation when so required.
   No person shall cause, allow or permit a vehicle to occupy a meter space
beyond the maximum consecutive parking time limit lawfully prescribed, for the
particular space occupied, by appropriate notice on the meter or on posted
signs, irrespective of the number or amount of coin deposited in such meter.

501.05 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (a)    A person is subject to misdemeanor prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or

service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
 
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
(ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
 
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
 
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
 
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
 
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
 
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
 
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
 
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
“The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from the
witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
 
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
 
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
 
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
      A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
      B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
      C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
      D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 Type of                                     Maximum
Misdemeanor                                   Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
       (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
 
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2909.11)

the other person’s consent.
   (b)   (1)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause
or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that

      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

a written warning notice to the alarm user advising of the number of false
alarms recorded for that alarm system to date and the schedule of fees for
multiple false alarms.

system has generated an excessive number of false alarms. An excessive number
of false alarms for the purpose of this section is an accumulation of more than
ten false alarms within a twelve consecutive month period.

by the Village Administrator, as provided for in this section, and in
subsection (b)(5) hereof and the alarm system thereafter continues to emit
false alarms, shall be deemed to have committed a minor misdemeanor. An alarm
system may be reconnected only if satisfactory evidence is provided to the

749.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)    In enacting this chapter, pursuant to Sections 503.51 and 503.52 of
the Ohio Revised Code, the Village of Mingo Junction makes the following
statement of intent and findings:
      (1)    Adult entertainment establishments require special supervision
from the public safety agencies of the Village in order to protect and preserve
the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the patrons and employees of the
businesses as well as the citizens of the Village.
      (2)    The Council of the Village finds that adult entertainment
establishments are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including
prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature.
      (3)    The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate
health concern of the Village that demands reasonable regulation of adult
entertainment establishments by the Village in the specified manner, and
expanded authority for reasonable regulation of adult entertainment
establishments by local governments, in order to protect the health and well-
being of the citizens.
      (4)    Minimal regulations enacted by the Village are a legitimate and
reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult
entertainment establishments comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure
that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places
of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.
      (5)    There is convincing documented evidence that adult entertainment
establishments, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both
the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas
adjacent to them, cause increased crime, particularly in the overnight hours,
and downgrade property values.
      (6)    The Village Council desires to minimize and control these adverse
effects by regulating adult entertainment establishments in the specified
manner. And by minimizing and controlling these adverse effects, the Village
Council seeks to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry;
protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life;
preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; and
deter the spread of urban blight.
      (7)    The Village Council has determined that current local zoning and
other locational criteria do not adequately protect the health, safety, and
general welfare of the people of the Village and that expanded regulation of
adult entertainment establishments is necessary.
      (8)    It is not the intent of the Village Council in enacting this act
to suppress or authorize the suppression of any speech activities protected by
the First Amendment, but to enact content-neutral statutes that address the
secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments.
      (9)    It is not the intent of the Village Council to condone or
legitimize the distribution of obscene material, and the Village Council
recognizes that state and federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene
materials and expects and encourages state law enforcement officials to enforce
state obscenity statutes against any such illegal activities in this State.
   (b)   It is the intent of the Village Council in enacting this chapter to
regulate in the specified manner adult entertainment establishments in order to
promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the
Village and establish reasonable regulations to prevent the deleterious
secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments within the Village. The
provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a
limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials,
including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent of the
Village Council in enacting this chapter to restrict or deny, or authorize the
restriction or denial of, access by adults to sexually oriented materials
protected by the First Amendment, or to deny, or authorize the denial of,
access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult entertainment and adult
materials to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of the
Village Council in enacting this chapter to condone or legitimize the
distribution or exhibition of obscene material.
   (c)   Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult
uses on communities presented in hearings and in reports made available to the
legislature and subsequently adopted by the Ohio General Assembly as findings
under Section 3 of House Bill 23 (and on findings incorporated in the cases of

from various other police reports, testimony, newspaper reports, and other

Andy's Rest. & Lounge, Inc. v. City of Gary (7th Cir. 2006), 466 F.3d 550, and
the Village Council's independent review of the same) the finds:
      (1)    Adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the
operators of the establishments.
      (2)    Certain employees of adult entertainment establishments, as
defined in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets, engage in a higher
incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments.
      (3)    Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur
at adult    entertainment establishments, especially those that provide private
or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
The "couch dances" or "lap dances" that frequently occur in adult entertainment
establishments featuring live nude or seminude dancers constitute or may
constitute the offense of "engaging in prostitution" under Section 2907.25 of
the Ohio Revised Code.
      (4)    Offering and providing private or semi-private booths or cubicles
encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
      (5)    Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sexual
activity within the premises of those adult entertainment establishments.
      (6)    Numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis salmonella, campylobacter and shigella infections,
chlamydial, myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections, trichomoniasis, and
chancroid.
      (7)    Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States: 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983,
4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in 1985, and 253,448 through December 31, 1992.
      (8)    A total of 10,255 AIDS cases had been reported in Ohio as of
January 1999. Ohio has required HIV case reporting since 1990, and the reported
information shows 7,969 people living with (HIV) (4,213) and (AIDS) (3,756) in
the State.
      (9)    Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing
cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in
Ohio.
      (10)    The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen. 33,613 cases were reported in 1982,
and 45,200 cases were reported through November 1990.
      (11)    The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being
reported in 1990.
      (12)    The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, and exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      (13)    According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV
infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by
sexual acts.
      (14)    Sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment establishments
are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy,
and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the
failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate
those activities and maintain those facilities.
      (15)    The findings noted in divisions (c)(1) to (14) of this section
raise substantial governmental concerns.
      (16)    Adult entertainment establishments have operational
characteristics that require or mandate subject them to reasonable government
regulation in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
      (17)    The enactment of this chapter will promote the general welfare,
health, morals, and safety of the citizens of this Village.

revocation of the license and the applicant may pursue an appeal to Jefferson
County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to Revised Code Chapter 2506. This appeal

of a decision rendered under this chapter and during the entire time required
for the court to rule on the appeal pursuant to subsection (b) above.

business prior to the denial of a license renewal application, or the

appeal to the Village Council of a decision rendered under this chapter and

subsection (b) above.
   (e)   In the event that any judicial review of the denial of a new or
renewal license application or the revocation or suspension of a license is
still pending thirty (30) days before the expiration date of any license, the
licensee may file a renewal license application with the Village Police Chief
or its designee pursuant to this chapter. In the event that an application for
renewal of a license is denied and the applicant seeks judicial review of that
denial, the Village has the right to consolidate such review with any pending
judicial actions in regards to the previous denial, suspension or revocation of
a license.

above, there are additional denials of a renewal license application or
suspensions or revocations of that license, the Village has the right to

denials, suspensions or revocations with any pending appeal for that same
licensee.

constructed on a single parcel of land, a separate and independent building
sewer shall be provided for each building.
   (c)   The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building,
sewer and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing,
testing, or backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of
the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations for
the Village. In the absence of code provisions, the materials and procedures
set forth in appropriate specifications of the American Standard for Test
Materials and Water Pollution Control Federation Manual of Practice No. 9 and
any amendments thereto shall apply.
   (d)   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any
building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the building sewer, the
sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted or gravity
drained by a method approved by the Village Administrator to discharge the
sewerage to the building sewer.
   (e)   No person shall discharge to any natural outlet within the Village, or
in any area under the jurisdiction of the Village, any wastewater or other
polluted waters.
   (f)   No person shall construct or maintain any privy, privy vault, septic
tank, cesspool, or other facility intended or used for the disposal of
wastewater without first obtaining the required permits from the Village.
   (g)   No person, firm, or corporation shall discharge or cause to be
discharged directly or indirectly any storm water, groundwater, roof runoff,
subsurface drainage, cooling water, or unpolluted industrial process water to
any sanitary sewer.
   (h)   No person shall discharge into the building sanitary sewer the surface
water which collects in basement or foundation excavations. If the building
sanitary sewer is complete before the plumbing can be connected thereto, the
builder or sewer tapper shall keep the end of the building sanitary sewer
tightly closed with a plumber's plug or other watertight plug.
   (i)    The owner(s) of all houses, building, or properties used for human
occupancy, employment, recreation, or other purposes, situated within the
Village and abutting on any street, alley, or right of way in which there is
now located or may in the future be located a public sanitary or combined sewer
of the Village, is hereby required at the owner's expense to install suitable
toilet facilities therein, and to connect such facilities directly to the
proper public sewer in accordance with the rules and regulations within ninety
days after date of official notice to do so, provided the foundation wall of
the structure from which sewage or other wastes originated is less than 100
feet from the nearest boundary of the right of way within which the sewer is
located.
   (j)   No person shall place, deposit, or permit to be deposited in any
unsanitary manner on public or private property within the Village, or in any
area under the jurisdiction of such Village, any human or animal excrement,
garbage, or other objectionable waste.
   (k)   No person in constructing a sanitary sewer, building or house
connection, shall leave same open, unsealed, or incomplete in such a fashion as
to permit storm, surface, or subsurface water to enter such sewers.
   (l)    No new connections will be permitted unless there is sufficient
capacity in all downstream facilities.
(Ord. 1987-65. Passed 11-12-87.)
925.03 PROHIBITED WASTES.
   (a)    No wastes shall be discharged, either directly or indirectly, into
any sewer within the City Sewer Service Area without prior approval from the
Village.
   (b)   No User shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or
indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which will interfere with the operation
or performance of the POTW. These general prohibitions apply to all such Users
of a POTW whether or not the User is subject to National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards or any other national, State, or local Pretreatment
Standards or Requirements. A User may not contribute the following substances
to any POTW:
      (1)    Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or
quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other
substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the
POTW or to the operation of the POTW. They will not constitute a hazard to
humans or animals, create a public nuisance, or create any hazard in the
receiving waters of a sewage treatment plant, including but not limited to
those metals or toxic substances mentioned in this chapter as discharge to the
public sewer. At no time, shall two successive readings on an explosion hazard
meter, at the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the
system) be more than five percent (5%) nor any single reading over ten percent
(10%) of the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the meter. Prohibited materials
include, but are not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene,
xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates,
perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides and sulfides and any other
substances which the Village, the State or EPA has notified the User is a fire
hazard or a hazard to the system.
      (2)    Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the
flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the wastewater
treatment facilities such as, but not limited to: grease, garbage with
particles greater than one-half inch (½") in any dimension, animal guts or
tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood,
feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass,
straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, waste paper,
wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining, or
processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud, or glass grinding or polishing
wastes.
   (c)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following
described substances, materials, waters, or wastes if it appears likely in the
opinion of the Village Administrator that such wastes can harm either the
sewers, sewer system or equipment, sewage treatment process or equipment, or
have an adverse effect on the receiving stream, or can otherwise endanger life,
limb, public property, or constitute a nuisance. Informing his opinion as to
the acceptability of these wastes, the Village Administrator shall give
consideration to such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in relation
to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers,
nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of the sewage treatment plant,
degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant, and other
pertinent factors. The substances prohibited are:
      (1)   Maximum allowable temperature into sewers or waterways. Any liquid
or vapor having a temperature higher than 150 degrees F., or causing the
temperature at the treatment facility to exceed 104 degrees F.
      (2)   Maximum allowable ether solubles. Any water or waste containing
fats, wax, grease, or oils whether emulsified or not, in excess of eighty mg/
l ether soluble or containing substances which may solidify or become viscous
at temperatures between 32 degrees F. and 140 degrees F.
      (3)   Regulation of garbage grinders. Any garbage that has not been
properly shredded. The installation and operation of any garbage grinder
equipped with a motor of three-fourth horsepower (0.76 hp metric) or greater
shall be subject to the review and approval of the Village Administrator.
      (4)   Prohibition of acid and plating wastes. Any waters or wastes
containing strong acid wastes, or concentrated plating solutions whether
neutralized or not, are prohibited.
      (5)    Maximum metal concentrations. Any water or wastes containing iron,
chromium, copper, zinc, or similar objectionable or toxic substances, or wastes
exerting an excessive chlorine requirement, to such degree that any such
material received in the composite sample at the wastewater treatment works
exceed the limits established by the Village Administrator or this chapter for
such materials. Materials such as copper, zinc, chromium, or similar toxic
substances shall be limited to the following average quantities in the sewage
as it enters the POTW. Concentration at the wastewater treatment plant shall
not exceed three times the average concentration:
Material     Parts per Billion
Arsenic      50
Barium       800
Cadmium      5
Chromium     300
Copper as Cu 500

and with contributions from individual establishments subject to control in
volume and concentration by the Village Administrator.
   (d)   Permissible Cyanide Levels. Maximum cyanide to be accepted into sewer
system will be one milligram per liter with no dilution and five milligrams per
liter with high dilution. Both stated figures shall be regulated at the
discretion of the Village Administrator.
   (e)   Prohibition of Taste or Odor Causing Substance. Any waters or wastes
containing phenols or other taste or odor-producing substances, in such
concentrations exceeding limits which may be established by the Village
Administrator as necessary, after treatment of the composite sewage, to meet
the requirements of the State, Federal, or other public agencies of
jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters, are prohibited. Any
waters or wastes that contain phenols in excess of 0.40 parts per million by
weight are prohibited (400 parts per billion). These limits may be modified by
the Village Administrator if the aggregate of contributions throughout the
Mingo Junction area of service create treatment difficulties, or produce a
plant effluent discharge to receiving waters, which may be prohibitive.
   (f)   Prohibition of Radioactive Wastes. Any radioactive wastes or isotopes
of such half-life (over 100 days) or concentration as may exceed limits
established by the Village Administrator in compliance with applicable State or
Federal regulations. The radioactive isotopes I131 and p32 used at hospitals
are not prohibited, if properly diluted at the source.
   (g)   Prohibition of Corrosive Wastes. Any water or wastes, acid or alkaline
in reaction, and having corrosive properties capable of causing damage or
hazard to structures, equipment or personnel of the Mingo Junction Water
Pollution Control System. Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.5. Any
water or waste having a pH higher than 9.0. Free acids and alkalis of such
waste must be neutralized at all times.
   (h)   Prohibition of Noxious Substances. Any noxious or malodorous gas or
substance, which either singly or by interaction with other waste, is capable
of creating a public nuisance or hazard to life or of preventing entry into
sewers for their maintenance or repair, are prohibited.
   (i)   Prohibition of Excessive Waste Concentration. Materials which exert or
cause:
      (1)    Abnormal concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but
not limited to, Fullers earth, lime slurries, and lime residue) or of inert
dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride, calcium
chloride and sodium sulfate) from ion exchange softeners.
      (2)   Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions).
      (3)   Abnormal BOD, chemical oxygen demand, suspended solids, phosphorus
or chlorine requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant load
on the wastewater treatment works.
      (4)   Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting
"slugs" as defined herein. In no case shall a slug load have a flow rate or
contain concentration or qualities of pollutants that exceed for any time
period longer than fifteen minutes more than three times the average twenty-
four hour concentration, quantities, or flow during normal operation.
   (j)   Prohibition of Non-Treatable Wastes. Waters or wastes containing
substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the wastewater
treatment processes employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree
that the wastewater treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of
other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
   (k)   Any substance which will cause the Village wastewater plant to violate
its NPDES and/or State Disposal System Permit or the receiving water quality
standards.
   (l)   Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological
activity in the Village wastewater treatment plant resulting in interference,
but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the
wastewater plant which exceeds 30°C. (85°F.).
   (m)   Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity,
either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere
with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or
animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the wastewater
treatment plant, or to exceed the limitation set forth in a Categorical
Pretreatment Standard. A toxic pollutant shall include, but not be limited to,
any pollutant identified pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act.
   (n)   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewer, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated herein, and which in the judgement of the
Village Administrator may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works,
processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard
to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Village Administrator may:
      (1)    Refer to Section
925.05  for action to be taken.
      (2)   Reject the wastes specified in this chapter.
      (3)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers.
      (4)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge to an
acceptable condition.
      (5)   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
extra strength wastes or unusual discharges not covered by existing taxes or
sewer charges.
   (o)   Upon the promulgation of the Federal Categorical Pretreatment
Standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the Federal Standard, if
more stringent than limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that
subcategory, shall immediately supercede the limitations imposed under this
chapter. The Village Administrator shall notify all affected Users of the
applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR, Section 403.12.
   (p)   No user shall ever increase the use of process water or attempt to
dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment
to achieve compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards or those
developed by the State or Village.
   (q)   No statement contained in this section shall be interpreted as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the Village and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the Village for treatment. In all such cases, the provisions
set forth in the Village ordinance establishing charges will be governing
factors in any contracts entered into.
   (r)   Every person, firm or corporation whose premises are served by a
sanitary sewer connection and discharges wastes other than "domestic sewage"
into the sewerage system of the Village shall be charged and shall pay a Sewage
Surcharge in addition to the Sewer Service Charge for "domestic sewage."
   Such surcharge shall be based on four constituents of the water or wastes
applicable:
      (1)    Total Suspended Solids.
      (2)    B.O.D., five days at 20 degrees Centigrade.
      (3)    C.O.D., potassium dichromate-sulfuric acid oxidation.
      (4)    Phosphorus.
   Whenever the wastes are ruled acceptable to wastewater treatment and the
wastewater contains suspended solids, B.O.D., and/or C.O.D., or phosphorus in
excess of "domestic sewage", the excess shall be subjected to a surcharge
derived in accordance with the following formula:
SC    =   (SS-280) x F x 8.34 x C + (BOD-240) x F x 8.34 x Cb =
F x 8.34 [(SS-280)Cs + (BOD-240)Cb].
SC    =   Total surcharge based on average daily flow.
SS    =   Total suspended solids in wastes as discharged in milligrams per
liter.
280   =   Suspended solids concentration in "domestic sewage" in milligrams per
liter.
F   =   Flow in millions of gallons per day of wastes as discharged.
Cs   =   Cost to treat one pound of suspended solids in cents per pound. Total
OM & R
cost attributable to SS (25%)/Total pounds suspended solids removed.
BOD   =   Total B.O.D. in wastes as discharged in milligrams per liter.
240   =   B.O.D. concentration in "domestic sewage" in milligrams per liter.
Cb    =   Cost to treat one pound of B.O.D. in cents per pound. Total OM & R
cost
attributable to BOD (25%)/Total pounds B.O.D. removed.
OR
SC    =    (SS-280) x F x Cs + (COD-500) x F x 8.34 Cc =
      F x 8.34 [(SS-280/Cs + (COD-500) Cc]
COD   =   Total C.O.D. in wastes as discharged in milligrams per liter.
500   =   C.O.D. concentration in "domestic sewage" in milligrams per liter.
Cc   =   Cost to treat one pound of C.O.D. in cents per pound per day.
Cc   =   Total operation cost attributable to COD/Total pounds C.O.D. removed.
OR
SCp    =   (P-10) x 8.34 x F x Cp
P    =    Total phosphorus in wastes as discharged in milligrams per liter.
10    =   Total phosphorus concentration in "domestic sewage" in milligrams per
liter.
F   =   Flow in millions of gallons per day.
Cp    =    Cost to treat one pound of phosphorus in cents per pound per day.
   Whenever a waste cannot be analyzed by a B.O.D. test, the C.O.D. result
shall prevail in calculating the Surcharge. Whenever both testing methods are
possible, the Superintendent shall determine which analysis shall apply in
computing the Surcharge based on which will provide the higher Surcharge.
   (s)   The Village Administrator shall, on or before February 1, of each
year, review the Strength Surcharge for the Water Pollution Control Department
the previous year. Increases or decreases in the cost of treating and disposing
of excess amounts of B.O.D., suspended solids, C.O.D. and phosphorus shall be
reflected on a proportionate basis in the Strength Surcharge on the basis of
cost per pound. Increases or decreases in the actual cost of gathering samples,
testing and reporting the results of analysis done on industrial sewage shall
be reflected on a proportionate basis. Changes in the Strength Charge as
determined by the Village Administrator shall be approved by a majority of
Council.
   (t)   The costs to treat the B.O.D., C.O.D., suspended solids, or phosphorus
will be based on those portions of the total OM & R cost of the sewerage works
attributable to BOD, SS, and COD. These costs shall be adjusted annually to
remain current with the OM & R costs and shall be submitted to Council for
approval and passage in ordinance form.
   (u)   Any person who fails to pay the proper Surcharge shall reduce the
level of their waste to the strength of "normal sewage". Failure to reduce the
level of waste to "normal sewage" or failure to terminate operations within
sixty days after written notification thereof shall be considered to be a
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not less than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day;
each day shall constitute a separate violation.
(Ord. 1987-65. Passed 11-12-87.)
925.04 PRETREATMENT.
   (a)   No person shall discharge without a permit to any natural outlet
within the Village or in any area under the jurisdiction of the Village and/or
to the Village Water Pollution Control Plant, any wastewater except as
authorized by the Village Administrator in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter.
   (b)    (1)    Proposed new users. All non-residential Users proposing to
connect to or to contribute to the Village wastewater works must obtain a
Wastewater Discharge Permit at least ninety days prior to connecting to or
contributing to the Village’s wastewater works.

contributing to the Village’s wastewater works must also obtain a Wastewater
Discharge Permit within 210 days after the effective date of the chapter.
   (c)   Any User subject to a Pretreatment Standard, after the compliance date
of such Pretreatment Standard, or, in the case of a New User or New Source,
after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the Village
Administrator during the months of June and December, unless required more
frequently in the Pretreatment Standard or by the Village Administrator, a
report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent
which are limited by such Pretreatment Standards. In addition, this report
shall include a record of all daily flows which during the reporting period
exceeded the average daily flow. At the discretion of the Village Administrator
and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays,
budget cycles, etc., the Village Administrator may alter the months during
which the above reports are to be submitted.
   (d)   In cases where the character of sewage or industrial waste from any
manufacturing or industrial plant, building, or premises is such that it will
damage the sewerage system or cannot be treated satisfactorily at the
wastewater treatment plant, the Village shall compel such users to dispose of
such waste and prevent it from entering the sewerage system.
   (e)   In cases where the character of sewage or industrial waste from any
manufacturing or industrial plant, building, or premises shows excessive flow
rates or concentration of pollutants such that it imposes an unreasonable
burden upon the sewage collection, pumping, or treatment works greater than
that imposed by the average sewage entering the sewerage system, the Village
may: compel such manufacturing or industrial plant, building, or premises to
pretreat such sewage in such manner as specified by the Village before
discharging it into the sewerage system; require flow control or equalization
of such wastes so as to avoid any "slug" loads or excessive loads that may be
harmful to the treatment works, or require payment of a surcharge on any
excessive loadings discharged to the treatment works to cover the additional
costs of treating such wastes.
   (f)    Users required to obtain a Wastewater Discharge Permit shall complete
and file with the Village, a Wastewater Discharge Permit Application in the
form prescribed by the Village, and accompanied by a fee of twenty-five dollars
($25.00). Existing Users shall apply for a Wastewater Discharge Permit within
thirty days after the effective date of this chapter, and proposed new Users
shall apply at least ninety days prior to connecting to or contributing to the
wastewater works. In support of the Wastewater Discharge Permit Application,

and elevation;
      (7)   Description of activities, facilities and plant processes on the
premises, including all materials which are or could be discharged;
      (8)   Where known, the nature and concentration of any pollutants in the
discharge which are limited by any Village, State, or Federal Pretreatment
Standards, and a statement regarding whether or not the Pretreatment Standards
are being met on a consistent basis and if not, whether additional Operation
and Maintenance (O & M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the User
to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards;
      (9)    If additional pretreatment and/or O & M will be required to meet
the Pretreatment Standards, the shortest schedule by which the User will
provide such additional pretreatment. The completion date in this schedule
shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable
Pretreatment Standard; The following conditions shall apply to this schedule:
         A.    The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards (e.g. hiring an engineer, completing
preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major
components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.)
         B.    No increment referred to in subsection (f)(9)A. shall exceed
nine months.
         C.    Not later than fourteen days following each date in the schedule
and the final date for compliance, the User shall submit a progress report to
the Superintendent including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it
expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and

require additional information. After evaluation and acceptance of the data
furnished, the Village may authorize the industry to discharge subject to the
terms and conditions of this chapter.
   (g)   Any User subject to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards must
submit within nine months a revised disclosure form of the information required
by subsection (f)(8) and (9) hereof.
   (h)   Within ninety days following the date for final compliance with
applicable National Pretreatment Standards or as required by the Village, the
industry shall submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of all
pollutants and the average and maximum daily flows for those processes which
are limited by pretreatment standards or requirements.
   (i)   As ordered by the Village the owner or operator of any premises or
facility discharging industrial wastes into the system shall install at his own
cost and expense suitable monitoring equipment to facilitate the accurate
observation, sampling, and measurement of wastes. Such equipment shall be
maintained in proper working order and kept safe and accessible at all times.
   (j)   The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the
industrial user's premises outside of the building. When such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the User the Village may allow such
facility to be constructed in the public right of way, with the approval of the
public agency having jurisdiction over such right of way, and located so that
it will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping or parked vehicles.
   (k)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided by the owner when,
in the opinion of the Village Administrator, they are necessary for the proper
handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any
flammable wastes, sand and other harmful ingredients; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units.
   (l)   When more than one User can discharge into a common sewer, the Village
may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each User. When
there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and
characteristics produced by different operations of a single User, the Village
may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each separate
discharge.
   (m)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the Village requirements and
all applicable construction standards and specifications.
   (n)   Compliance determinations with respect to the prohibitions and
limitations stated in Section
925.02 may be made on the basis of either instantaneous grab samples or
composite samples of wastewater. Composite samples may be taken over a 24-hour
period, or over a longer or shorter time span, as determined necessary by the
Village in order to meet the needs of specific circumstances.
   (o)   Laboratory analysis of industrial wastewater samples shall be
performed in accordance with the current edition of "Standard Methods",
"Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Waste", published by the U.S. EPA,
or the "Annual Book of Standards, Part 23, Water, Atmospheric Analysis",
published by the American Society for Testing and Materials. Analysis of those
pollutants not covered by these publications shall be performed in accordance
with procedures established by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA).
   (p)   Sampling of industrial wastewater for the purpose of compliance
determination with respect to the prohibitions and limitations stated in
Section
925.02 will be done at such intervals as designated by the Village. All records
of sampling and other information must be kept for a period of at least three
years.
   (q)   Duly authorized employees of the Village bearing proper credentials
and identification shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purpose
of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, and testing pertinent to
discharge to the community system in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
   (r)    Duly authorized Village employees may obtain information concerning
industrial processes which have a direct bearing on the kind and source of
discharge to the wastewater collection system. The industry may withhold
information considered confidential provided that the industry establishes that
revealing such information to the public might result in an advantage to
competitors.
   (s)   While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to
in subsection (m) hereof, the Village or duly authorized employees of the
Village shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises.
   (t)   Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this chapter.
Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be
provided and maintained at the owner's or operator's own cost and expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the Village review, and shall be approved by
the Village before construction of the facility. Review and approval of such
plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify his facility as necessary to meet the requirements of
this chapter.
   (u)   If, for any reason, a facility does not comply with or will be unable

(Ord. 1987-65. Passed 11-12-87.)
925.06 ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   There is hereby established a committee, comprised of the Mayor, the
Treasurer and the Village Administrator, whose function shall be to review the
user charges of the Water Pollution Control Department on an annual basis, in
accordance with 40 CFR 35929-2B of the Federal Register. On or before January
31 of each year, the Auditor shall submit a report of all expenditures of the
Water Pollution Control Department for the previous year to such committee and
to Council. Thereafter on or before March 1 of each year, such committee shall
calculate and compare the operation, maintenance and replacement costs of the
Water Pollution Control Department for the immediately preceding year to those
of the operation, maintenance and replacement costs of the second preceding
year and adjust the user charges in accordance with the difference reflected
between those comparative operation, maintenance and replacement cost figures.
The purpose of this adjustment is to annually reflect in the user charges the
actual costs for the operation, maintenance and replacement of the Water
Pollution Control Department and/or any anticipated expenditures pertaining to
the operation, maintenance and replacement costs proportionately among the
Users of Water Pollution Control Department sewage system. The new rates as
determined by this committee shall be submitted to Council for their review and
passage at the first meeting of Council in the month of March of each year.
   (b)    For the purpose of providing revenue to help finance the
construction, operation, maintenance, or improvements to the sewage treatment
plant, sewer system, or pump stations, a sanitary sewer service charge shall be
charged to the Users of the sewerage system of the Village. The funds received
from the collection of the rates and charges shall be deposited daily in a
separate fund designated Sewer Revenue Fund. The accounting system shall keep
separate that portion of the monies collected for O M & R and those collected
for debt service. Funds collected by the O M & R portion of the sewer service
charge or user charges shall be used for the payment of the cost and expense of
the operation, maintenance, repair, replacement and management of the system to
maintain capacity and performance during the useful life of the treatment
works. Enlargement, expansions and improvements to the system shall be
considered betterments and as such shall be paid for with the funds collected
from the debt service portion of the sewer service charges. Any excess in the O
M & R portion of this fund shall be used to calculate any adjustment in the
rate for user classes.
   (c)   All premises within the corporation limits of the Village shall pay a
sewer service charge based upon the quantity of water used on the premises,
unless specified otherwise.
      (1)   The sewer service rates shall be broken down as follows:
         A.   A portion will be established to cover the costs for the
operation, maintenance and replacement of the treatment works.
         B.    A second portion will be established to cover cost of debt
reduction and capital improvements.
      (2)   Rates will be approved by Council.
      (3)   The rates will be calculated from the itemized annual O M & R costs
to provide sewage, including the costs for treatment, conveyance, and billing.
      (4)   The O M & R costs divided by the billable flow (that which can be
accounted for), will determine the required user charge.
      (5)   Users will be notified once per year of what portion of the sewer
service rates are attributed to O M & R.
      (6)   All revenue shall be deposited in the Sewer Revenue Fund.
   (d)   (1)    Each sewer service charge levied is hereby made a lien upon the
premises charged therewith, and if the same is not paid within thirty days
after it shall be due and payable, it may be certified to the Auditor of
Jefferson County, who shall place the same on the tax duplicate with the
interest and penalties allowed by law and be collected as other municipal taxes
are collected. The Village shall also have the right in the event of non-
payment as aforesaid, to discontinue water service to such premises of water
supplied by the Village’s water works system or disconnect the sewer at the
Owner's expense until such unpaid sewer charges have been fully paid.
      (2)    In the case of leased lots, parcels of land or premises having a
connection with the system, the lessor and lessee shall both be liable for the
payment of the sewer charges and the Village may proceed to collect such
charges from either the lessor or the lessee, or it may certify delinquent
charges to the Auditor of Jefferson County as herein provided.

between the Village and the owner of any premises served by the system, such
additional charges for industrial wastes of unusual strength or composition or
for other unduly burdensome discharges into the system which are accepted by
the Village for treatment as may be determined to be fair and equitable. Each
such special agreement and the charges established thereby shall not become
effective until ratified by ordinance duly passed by Council.
(Ord.1634. Passed 6-9-58.)
929.06 MEASURES FOR DETERMINING SEWER CHARGES.
   The following measures shall be used to determine sewer charges provided by
Section
929.04 upon all premises served by the system:
   (a)   On premises using water exclusively supplied by the Village, water
consumption shall be measured by water meter acceptable to the Village
Administrator.
   (b)   On premises using water supplied either in whole or in part from
sources other than the waterworks of the Village, the Village Administrator may
require the owner or other interested party to install water meters
satisfactory to the Village Administrator to the extent necessary to measure
all such supplies of water, and the quantity of water consumed on such premises
shall be deemed to be the aggregate amount disclosed by such meters.
   (c)   In the event it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Village
Administrator with respect to any premises that a portion of the water from any
source consumed on such premises does not and cannot enter the system, then in
each such case, the owner or other interested party may at his expense install
and maintain separate metering devices to the extent necessary to demonstrate
to the satisfaction of the Village Administrator the portion of the water
consumed on the premises which is discharged into the system, which portion
shall constitute the basis for measuring the sewer charges for the premises

served by the Village’s waterworks system, such charges shall be billed and
payable quarterly, unless, upon application to the Village Administrator, he
shall approve a monthly billing period for such premises, and in either case,
shall be payable at the same time, respectively, as water bills are rendered
and become payable. In case of failure to pay any bill for sewer charges when
due, a penalty of five percent of the charges shall be added to such bill.

to the use of private property in the Village of Mingo Junction and do not

1101.03 PURPOSE.
   This Planning and Zoning Code establishes certain districts in the Village

the most appropriate uses of the land and guide the future development of the

   (c)   Encourage compatibility between different land uses and protect the
scale and character of existing development from the encroachment of
incompatible uses.
   (d)   Regulate and restrict the location, bulk, height and land coverage of
buildings to protect the character and value of the Village's residential,
business and industrial areas.
   (e)    Regulate the area and dimension of lots, yards and other open spaces
to provide adequate open spaces for light and air.

restriction upon the use of buildings or land or upon the height and/or bulk of

may prescribe appropriate conditions, stipulations, safeguards and limitations
on the use as it may deem necessary and in conformance with the intent and
purposes of this Chapter.
   (b)    If the proposed use is found not to comply with the specifications of
this Planning and Zoning Code, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall deny
the application. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall indicate in its
minutes the reason(s) for its action.
   If the Planning and Zoning Commission fails to act within ninety (90) days
from the date the application was deemed complete, or an extended period as may
be agreed upon, then the applicant may deem the application denied.
(Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1111.08 TERMS AND DURATION OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   Following the Planning and Zoning Commission's approval of an application
for a conditional use permit, the Zoning Inspector shall issue a conditional
use permit.
   (a)    The permit shall authorize a particular conditional use on a specific
parcel for which it was approved. The permit shall be valid only for the use
and the operation of such use as specified on the permit. The breach of any
condition, safeguard or requirement shall constitute a violation of this
Planning and Zoning Code.
   (b)    An approved conditional use permit shall remain valid for a period of
twelve (12) months following the date of its approval, unless the Zoning
Inspector authorizes a longer period at the time of approval. If at the end of
that time, construction of the development has not begun then approval of such
conditional use permit shall expire and shall be of no effect unless
resubmitted and reapproved in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Chapter. Construction is deemed to have begun when all necessary excavation and
piers or footings of one or more principal buildings included in the plan have
been completed or substantial renovation has begun.
   (c)   Any expansion, enlargement, or change in the operation of the
conditional use that involves enlarging buildings or structures, expanding
impervious surfaces including parking areas, or changing the use shall require
approval of a separate conditional use permit.
      (Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1111.09 REAPPLICATION.
   No re-application for a conditional use permit shall be accepted by the
Zoning Inspector until the expiration of one (1) year after the denial or
revocation, unless the re-application is revised in response to the findings
given by the Planning and Zoning Commission in its denial of the initial
application. A re-application shall comply with all the requirements of this
Chapter, including payment of the required fee.
(Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1111.10 SIMILAR USES.
   Within each zoning district established by the Planning and Zoning Code and
any amendments thereto, uses of land or structures which are compatible with
each other are permitted in the district. To the extent that new types of uses
are created and are not addressed by this Planning and Zoning Code, this
section provides the procedure by which the Planning and Zoning Commission may
make a determination that a new use is similar to a use permitted by right or
conditionally permitted in a district.
   (a)    Determination. A proposed use may be permitted as a similar use when
the Planning and Zoning Commission determines that such proposed use is in
compliance with the following provisions:
      (1)   The proposed use is not prohibited in any other district;
      (2)    The proposed use is not listed as a permitted or conditionally
permitted building or use in any other district;
      (3)    The proposed use conforms to and is consistent with the purpose
statement of the proposed district more appropriately than in any other
district; and
      (4)   The proposed use is of the same general character as the permitted
or conditionally permitted uses in the district to which it is proposed or is
similar to a specific use permitted or conditionally permitted in that
district.
   (b)    Procedure. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the
proposed use according to the conditional use procedures set forth in Sections
1111.05 through
1111.06, including the requirement for a public hearing.
   (c)   Action by Planning and Zoning Commission. The Planning and Zoning
Commission shall either approve or disapprove the proposed similar use. If the
Planning and Zoning Commission approves the proposed similar use, then the
similar use shall be added to those districts that allow the principal or
conditional use that is most like the similar use.

such application provides the information necessary for review and evaluation.
If it is determined that such application does not provide the information
necessary for such review and evaluation, the Zoning Inspector shall within
five (5) working days so advise the applicant of the deficiencies and shall not
further process the application until the deficiencies are corrected.
   (b)   Review by the Board. According to the procedures established for
appeals in Sections

1115.04 AREA VARIANCE.
   The following factors shall be considered and weighed by the Board to
determine practical
difficulty:
   (a)   Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar
to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable generally to
other lands or structures in the same zoning district. Examples of such special
conditions or circumstances are exceptional irregularity, narrowness,
shallowness or steepness of the lot, or adjacency to non-conforming and
inharmonious uses, structures or conditions;
   (b)    Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
   (c)    Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary to
make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures;
   (d)    Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
   (e)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sewer and trash pickup;
   (f)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restrictions;
   (g)    Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of
actions of the owner;
   (h)    Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
   (i)    Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would be
observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance; and
   (j)   Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district. (Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-
24-02.)
1115.05 USE VARIANCE.
   ln order to grant a use variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
determine that strict
compliance with the tenns of this Code will result in unnecessary hardship to
the applicant. The applicant must demonstrate such difficulty by clear and
convincing evidence that all of the following criteria are satisfied:
   (a)   The property cannot be put to any economically viable use under any of
the permitted uses in the zoning district in which the property is located:
   (b)   The variance requested stems from a condition which is unique to the
property at issue and not ordinarily found in the same zone or district:
   (c)   The hardship is not created by actions of the applicant:
   (d)   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights of
adjacent property owners or residents:
   (e)   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public
health, safety or general welfare:
   (f)   The variance will be consistent with the general spirit and intent of
this Planning and Zoning Code: and
   (g)   The variance sought is the minimum that will afford relief to the
applicant.

provide for orderly growth and development, and to protect the property rights
of all individuals by assuring the compatibility of uses and practices within
districts.
(Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)

1131.03 ZONING DISTRICT MAP.
   The districts established in Section
1131.02 are bounded and defined as shown on the map entitled "Village of Mingo
Junction Zoning Map", which, together with all accompanying notations,
references, rules and designations, is hereby adopted and made a part of this
Planning and Zoning Code, thereby having the same force and effect as if herein
fully described in writing. The Village of Mingo Junction Zoning Map and all
its future additions, amendments, changes and supplements, designates the area
assigned to the respective use districts and their boundaries.
(Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1131.04 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   The following rules shall be used to determine the precise location of any
zoning district boundary unless such boundary is specifically indicated on the
Zoning Map of the Village of Mingo Junction.
   (a)   Where Boundaries Approximately Follow Streets, Alleys or Highways.
Where district boundaries are so indicated as approximately following the
center lines, right-of-way lines, or street lines of highways, streets, or
railroad lines, such center lines, right-of-way lines or street lines shall be
construed to be said boundaries.
   (b)   Where Boundaries Approximately Follow Lot Lines. Where district
boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow the lot lines, such
lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries.
   (c)   Where Boundaries Parallel Street Lines, Alley Lines or Highway Right-
of-Way Lines. Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are
approximately parallel to the center lines, right-of-way lines, or streetlines
of highways, streets, or railroad lines, such district boundaries shall be
construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated
on the Zoning Map of the Village of Mingo Junction. If no distance is given,
such dimensions shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on such
zoning map.
   (d)   Where Boundaries Approximately Follow Municipality Limits. Where
district boundaries are so indicated that they follow or approximately follow
the limits of the municipality, such boundaries shall be construed as following
such limits.
   (e)   Extension of District Where Lot Divided. Where a district boundary
line established in this Planning and Zoning Code or as shown on the Zoning Map
divides a lot which was in single ownership at the time of enactment of this
Planning and Zoning Code, the use authorized thereon and the other district
requirements applying to the most restricted portion of such lot under this
Planning and Zoning Code shall be considered as extending to the entire lot.
   (f)   Vacation of Public Ways. Whenever any street, or other public way is
vacated by the action of the Planning and Zoning Commission and with the
approval of the Village Council, the zoning district adjoining each side of
such thoroughfare, street or other public way shall automatically be extended
to the center of such vacation, and all areas within that vacation shall
thereforth be subject to all regulations appropriate to the respective extended
districts.
   (g)   Resolving Disputes. Any dispute regarding a zone district line shall
be heard by the Board of Zoning Appeals. In the event the Board finds the zone
district line is not consistent with the purposes and intent of this Planning
and Zoning Code, the Board shall prepare an appropriate recommendation to
Council.
      (Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1131.05 ANNEXATION.
   Upon annexation of township territory to the Village of Mingo Junction the
township zoning regulations then in effect shall remain in full force and shall
be enforced by the township officials until the Mingo Junction Village Council
adopts zoning regulations for the property. As an alternative to the procedures
set forth in Chapter
1117, Council may, after a report and recommendation by the Mingo Junction
Village Planning and Zoning Commission, by resolution made at or prior to the
time of its acceptance of township territory for annexation, classify all or
any part of territory annexed to the Village in such other district or
districts as Council may determine. Such resolution shall be passed by a
majority vote of all members of Council, except when the classification of
districts by Council is contrary to the report and recommendation of the
Planning and Zoning Commission, in which event the same shall not become
effective except by the favorable vote of four-fifths (4/5) of all members of
Council. Such resolution shall not be passed as an emergency measure. (Ord.
2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)

of this Planning and Zoning Code.
   (a)    Uses Permitted by Right. A use listed in Schedule

denoted by the letter "P" provided that all requirements of other Village
ordinances and this Planning and Zoning Code have been met.
   (b)    Conditional Uses. A use listed in Schedule
1133.03 shall be permitted as a conditional use in a district when denoted by
the letters "CU", provided the Planning and Zoning Commission first makes the
determination that the requirements of Chapter
1161 have been met, according to the procedures set forth in Chapter
1111.
   (c)    Accessory Uses. A use listed in Schedule
1133.03 shall be permitted as an accessory use in a district when denoted by
the letter "A". Such use shall be permitted as a subordinate use when it is
clearly incidental to and located on the same lot as the principal building or
use. Accessory uses are further regulated in subsequent sections of this
Planning and Zoning Code.
   (d)    Uses Not Listed in Schedule. Although a use may be indicated as a

district, it shall not be approved on a parcel unless it can be located thereon
in full compliance with all of the standards and other regulations of this
Planning and Zoning Code applicable to the specific use and parcel in question.
Any use not specifically listed as either a permitted, principal or conditional
use shall be a prohibited use in these zoning districts and shall only be
permitted upon amendment of this Planning and Zoning Code and/or the Village of
Mingo Junction Zoning Map as provided in Chapter
1117, or upon a finding by the Planning and Zoning Commission or Zoning
Inspector that a use is substantially similar to a principally permitted or
conditionally permitted use in the district according to the procedures set
forth in Section

obscure the view of accessory uses and minimize potential noise and visual
clutter.
   (a)    Buffer Yard Required Adjacent to Residential District. Screening and
buffering shall be required along the entire length of a common boundary
whenever a lot in a business district abuts any residential district.
      (1)   Screening Materials. When the natural vegetation within the
required buffer yard does not form a solid, continuous, visual screen or does
not have a minimum height of six (6) feet along the entire length of the common
boundary, screening shall be installed in one of the following forms:
         A.    Dense vegetative planting.
         B.    A non-living opaque structure such as a solid masonry wall, or a
solid fence that is compatible with the principal structure.

combination of which forms an effective visual screen as determined by the
Zoning Inspector.
      (2)   Location. The location of the wall, fence or vegetation shall be
placed within the buffer yard to maximize the screening effect as determined by
the Zoning Inspector.
      (3)   Height. Screening shall be a minimum of six (6) feet in height
measured from the natural grade, except for screening located along a common
side lot line in the area extending from the parking lot to the street where
the required screening shall not exceed a height of three (3) feet.
      (4)   Buffering Effect. The desired buffering effect shall be achieved
not later than twelve (12) months after the initial installation. The Zoning
Inspector may extend this twelve (12) month period where a hardship would be
created because of lack of expected growth or material shortages, but the
Zoning Inspector shall not extend such period beyond two (2) years from the
time the initial installation was to have been or has been completed.
   (b)    Parking Setback. The area within the parking setback shall be
landscaped with a minimum of grass groundcover and maintained in a suitable
manner.
   (c)   Screening of Accessory Uses. In all Business Districts, screening of
accessory uses shall be provided to obscure the view of such areas according to
the following:
      (l)    Waste Receptacles. All solid waste products, including empty
packing boxes, that result from any permitted principal, conditional or
accessory use shall either be disposed of, stored in buildings, or completely
enclosed in containers. Such container or dumpster shall be:
         A.    Located in a side or rear yard and shall comply with the minimum
parking setbacks established in Schedule
1137.06.
         B.    Screened from view. Screening material shall extend at least two
(2) feet above the storage container.
      (2)    Loading and Service Areas. Each loading area shall be adequately
screened so as not to be visible from the street right-of-way.
   (d)   Maintenance. All landscaping and buffering shall be maintained in good
and healthy condition at all times.
      (1)    All screening shall be free of advertising or other signs, except
for directional signs and other signs for the efficient flow of vehicles.
      (2)    The required landscaping shall be maintained in healthy condition
by the current owner and replaced when the Zoning Inspector determines that
such landscaping is no longer viable or no longer effectively achieves its
original purpose. Replacement material shall conform to the original intent of
the landscape plan.
      (3)    Vehicle parking shall not be permitted in landscaped areas.
         (Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)

1139.01 PURPOSE.
   The I-1 and I-2 Industrial Districts and their regulations are established
in order to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
   (a)    To provide convenient and sufficient zoning districts for industrial
activities and for the production, distribution, and exchange of goods and
services in order to serve and promote the economic development of the
community.
   (b)    To provide areas for industrial and wholesale activities which desire
both convenience of location and a reasonable amount of usable space sufficient
to meet the needs of parking, loading and unloading.
   (c)    To protect residential neighborhoods adjacent to industrial uses by
restricting the types of uses, particularly at the common boundaries, which
would create congestion, noise or other objectionable influences and by
preventing the encroachment of incompatible land uses, such as residences and
heavy industry.
   (d)    To carry out the following specific purposes:
      (1)   The I-1 Light Industrial Development District is intended to
provide areas for manufacturing, and warehousing which by their inherent
characteristics and the operations involved are not obnoxious to one another.
      (2)    The I-2 Heavy Industrial District is designed to retain and
provide areas for industrial uses which may produce dust, smoke, fumes, glare
and other objectionable influences and to provide locations for outdoor
activities and outdoor storage in association with a principal use and which
because of the nature and extent of the operations shall not be located in
close proximity to residential activities. (Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1139.02 USE REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Uses Permitted by Right. A use listed in Schedule
1139.03 shall be permitted by light as a principal use in a district when
denoted by the letter "P" provided that all requirements of all other Village
ordinances and this Planning and Zoning Code have been met.
   (b)   Conditional Uses. A use listed in Schedule
1139.03 shall be permitted as a conditional use in a district when denoted by
the letter "CU", provided the Planning and Zoning Commission first makes the
determination that the requirements of Chapter
1161 have been met according to the procedures set forth in Chapter
1111.
   (c)   Accessory Uses. A use listed in Schedule
1139.03 shall be permitted as an accessory use in a district when denoted by
the letter "A". Such use shall be permitted as a subordinate building or use
when it is clearly incidental to and located on the same lot as the principal
building or use. Accessory uses are further regulated in subsequent sections of
this Chapter.
   (d)   Use Not Listed in Schedule. Although a use may be indicated as a
permitted principal, conditional or accessory use in a particular industrial
district, it shall not be approved on a parcel unless it can be located thereon
in full compliance with all of the standards and other regulations of this
Planning and Zoning Code applicable to the specific use and parcel in question.
Any use not specifically listed as either a permitted principal or conditional
use shall be a prohibited use in these zoning districts and shall only be
permitted upon amendment of this Planning and Zoning Code and/or the Village of
Mingo Junction Zoning Map as provided in Chapter
1117, or upon a finding by the Planning and Zoning Commission that a use is
substantially similar to a principally permitted or conditional use in the
district according to the procedures set forth in Section
1111.10.

      (Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1139.10 LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING REQUIREMENTS.
   Landscape buffers shall be provided to reduce the impact between one zoning
district and another and between contrasting uses in the same district, to
obscure the view of accessory uses and minimize potential noise and visual
clutter.
   (a)   Buffer Yard Required Adjacent to Residential District. Screening and
buffering shall be required along the entire length of a common boundary
whenever a lot in an industrial district abuts any residential district.
      (1)   Screening Materials. When the natural vegetation within the
required buffer yard does not form a solid, continuous, visual screen or does
not have a minimum height of six (6) feet along the entire length of the common
boundary, screening shall be installed in one of the following forms:
         A.    Dense vegetative planting.
         B.    A non-living opaque structure such as a solid masonry wall or a
solid fence that is compatible with the principle structure.
         C.    A fence with openings accompanied by vegetative planting the
combination of which forms an effective visual screen as determined by the
Zoning Inspector.
      (2)    Location. The location of the wall, fence or vegetation shall be
placed within the buffer yard to maximize the screening effect as determined by
the Zoning Inspector.
      (3)    Height. Screening shall be a minimum of six (6) feet in height
measured from the natural grade, except for screening located along a common
side lot line in the area extending from the parking lot to the street where
the required screening shall not exceed a height of three (3) feet.
      (4)   Buffering Effect. The desired buffering effect shall be achieved
not later than twelve (12) months after the initial installation. The Zoning
Inspector may extend this twelve (12) month period where a hardship would be
created because of lack of expected growth or material shortages, but the
Zoning Inspector shall not extend such period beyond two (2) years from the
time the initial installation was to have been or has been completed.
   (b)    Parking Setback. The area within the parking setback shall be
landscaped with a minimum of grass groundcover and maintained in a suitable
manner.
   (c)    Screening of Accessory Uses. In all Industrial Districts, screening
of accessory uses shall be provided to obscure the view of such areas according
to the following:
      (1)   Waste Receptacles. All solid waste products, including empty
packing boxes, that result from any permitted principal, conditional or
accessory use shall either be disposed of, stored in buildings, or completely
enclosed in containers. Such container or dumpster shall be:
         A.    Located in a side or rear yard and shall comply with the minimum
parking setbacks established in Schedule
1139.06.
         B.    Screened from view. Screening material shall extend at least two
(2) feet above the storage container.
   (d)    Loading and Service Areas. Each loading area shall be adequately
screened so as not to be visible from the street right-of-way.
   (e)    Outdoor Storage. Permitted accessory outdoor storage of goods,
supplies or equipment used in operation of an establishment shall be screened
using the screening and buffering requirement set forth in Section
1139.10(a).
   (f)   Maintenance. All landscaping and buffering shall be maintained in good
and healthy condition at all times.
      (1)    All screening shall be free of advertising or other signs, except
for directional signs and other signs for the efficient flow of vehicles.
      (2)    The required landscaping shall be maintained in healthy condition
by the current owner and replaced when the Zoning Inspector determines that
such landscaping is no longer viable or no longer effectively achieves its
original purpose. Replacement material shall conform to the original intent of
the landscape plan.
      (3)    Vehicle parking shall not be permitted in landscaped areas.
         (Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1139.11 DEVELOPMENT PLAN REVIEW.
   All uses in an Industrial District shall be permitted only after development
plans have been reviewed and approved by the Zoning Inspector according to the
procedures set forth in Chapter
1107.

1141.01 APPLICATION OF DISTRICT.
   The limits of the “NC” Neighborhood Conservation District shall be those
lands designated as neighborhood conservation district pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter. This district shall be deemed an overlay on any
base zoning district now or hereafter applicable to any lot. Should the “NC”
Neighborhood Conservation District to declared inapplicable to any lot by
action of the Village or any court of competent jurisdiction as provided for in
Section
1141.06, the zoning of such lot shall be deemed to be the base district in
which it is located without consideration of this chapter. It shall be unlawful
for any construction, subdivision or development, or use of land to be
undertaken for any property within this district unless all appropriate permits
and approvals have been obtained.
(Ord. 2017-22. Passed 11-28-17.)
1141.02 PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   The purpose of this chapter is to enable owners of properties within the “R-
1", “R-1A”, “R-2", and “R-3", residential zoning districts to petition the
Planning and Zoning Commission and Village Council to establish district use
regulations in their residential neighborhoods in order to restrict rental use
of single-family detached dwellings. This chapter establishes restrictions
intended to preserve the attractiveness, desirability and privacy of
residential neighborhoods by precluding all or certain types of rental
properties, thereby precluding the deleterious effect rental properties can
have on a neighborhood such as property deterioration, increased density,
congestion, and noise and traffic levels leading to the reduction of property
values. The goal of this chapter is to allow owners of properties with
residential neighborhoods to control the types of rental properties, if any,
that are permitted as single-family detached dwellings within their
neighborhood. It is also the purpose of this chapter:
   (a)   To protect the privacy of residents and to minimize noise, congestion
and nuisance impacts by regulating types of rental properties.
   (b)   To maintain an attractive community appearance and to provide a
desirable living environment for residents by preserving the owner-occupies
character of the neighborhood, and
   (c)   To prevent excessive traffic and parking problems in the
neighborhoods.
      (Ord. 2017-22. Passed 11-28-17.)
1141.03 USES PERMITTED.
   Uses permitted in the “NC” Neighborhood Conservation District shall be those
uses permitted in the underlying base zoning district except the use or
occupancy of single-family detached dwelling units requiring registration under
Chapter
1337 of the Village of Mingo Junction Codified Ordinances. (Ord. 2017-22.
Passed 11-28-17.)
1141.04 PROCEDURES.
   The following procedures must be followed in order to establish a “NC”
Neighborhood Conservation District:
   (a)   A petition requesting establishment of a neighborhood conservation
district must be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission on forms
provided by the Commission. The petition requirements are as follows:
      (1)   At least two (2) days prior to circulating a petition, the
circulator(s) of the petition must distribute a neighborhood conservation
district information sheet, provided by the Planning and Zoning Commission, to
each property owner of record within the area to be petitioned.
      (2)   The petition must clearly identify and describe the specific
boundaries where the neighborhood conservation district is to be located and if
practicable, such boundaries must consist of easily identifiable features such
as streets, alleys, platted subdivision boundaries or existing zoning district
lines.
      (3)   Each petition must be circulated by a person who owns property
within the proposed district and must be signed by the circulator.
      (4)   The petition must contain the signatures and addresses of two-
thirds (2/3) of the parcel owners within the proposed boundary of the district,
exclusive of public property. Jointly-owned parcels will be considered owned by
a single person for the purpose of petitioning, and any co-owner may sign a
petition for such parcel. Only one owner of each parcel will count towards the
two-thirds (2/3) requirements. If a person owns more than one parcel of
property within the proposed district, he or she may sign the petition for each
property he or she owns.
      (5)   Each person signing the petition must also enter, on the petition,
adjacent to their signature, the date that the person signed the petition.
      (6)   The petition must accurately advise the signer of what restrictions
would be imposed on the property if the district is established. The circulator
(s) of the petition shall verify on the petition that the required information
sheet was distributed to each owner of record at least two (2) days prior to
circulation of the petition and those signing the petition must acknowledge
that they received the required information sheet at least two (2) days prior
to signing the petition by marking the appropriate box next to their signature.
      (7)   There must be more than ten (10) separate lots or parcels within
the proposed district as described in the petition, clearly bounded in a
geographically logical way. In no instance shall the proposed district create
an island surrounded by the proposed district.
      (8)   When submitted, no signature dated earlier than six (6) months
prior to the time the petition is filed with the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall be counted to determine the validity of the petition.
   (b)   Upon presentation to the Planning and Zoning Commission for review,
the Village Administrator shall verify the signature on the petitions. If
insufficient signatures are presented, the Village Administrator shall return
the petitions to the person filing the petitions and identify the invalid
signatures. If sufficient valid signatures are presented, the Village
Administrator shall then, within thirty (30) days, determine whether they are
in conformity with the remaining provisions of this section.
      (1)   If the petition is determined to be in conformity with the
requirements of this section, it shall be placed on the agenda for discussion
at the earliest possible Planning and Zoning Commission meeting date.
      (2)   The following guidelines shall be used by the Planning and Zoning
Commission when considering a proposed neighborhood conservation district.
         A.   The proposed district complies with boundary criteria;
         B.   The proposed district will preserve and enhance neighborhood
character;
         C.   The proposed district will promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare of the people of the district;
         D.   The proposed district will promote and implement the intent of
the Comprehensive Plan; and
         E.   The proposed district will satisfy a legitimate need.
      (3)   If the petition is not in conformity with the requirements of this
section, the Village Administrator shall reject the petition and return it to
the person filing the petition with a written explanation as to why the
petition does not comply with the requirements of this section.
      (4)   If the petition is rejected for failure to comply with boundary
requirements, it may be resubmitted with the proper boundary lines if it is
accompanied by certification that a copy of the petition and written notice was
mailed to each property owner affected by the change, notifying them that their
property was added to or deleted from the petition and if by correction of the
boundary line the petition still complies with other requirements of this
chapter.
      (5)   If the petition is rejected for an insufficient number of valid
signatures, it may be resubmitted with additional signatures necessary to have
it comply as long as the other signatures remain valid.
      (6)   Any re-submission after a petition has been rejected must be filed
within ninety (90) days of rejection. Failure to comply this deadline shall
constitute final petition rejection and denial.
      (7)   After public hearing and recommendation by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, and prior to a final decision by Village Council, Council may by
ordinance amendment make changes to the boundaries of a proposed district,
whether or not the two-thirds (2/3) majority requirement of property owners
would still be met with the proposed changes.
   (c)   Subsequent to the introduction of an ordinance by Village Council
proposing to establish a neighborhood conservation district, the circulator(s)
of the petition or a majority of those persons who signed the petition may file
a written request with the Village Council to table consideration or further
proceedings toward adoption of the ordinance for sixty (60) days in order to
allow the submission of an alternate petition for a different boundary for the
district. If an alternate petition is submitted during the sixty (60) day
period, Village Council may introduce an alternate ordinance in conformity with
the subsequent petition, and the ordinance shall, to the extent possible, be
processed simultaneously. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall include in
its recommendation to Village Council which ordinance it concludes, after
public hearing, has the majority of the support of the property owners in the
proposed district and complies with the criteria in this Section
1141.04.
   (d)   After adoption by Village Council, a petition to change the boundaries
of a neighborhood conservation district or abolish a district pursuant to
Section 1141.06 of this chapter will not be considered for one (1) year,
following the same procedures used for establishing the initial district.
      (Ord. 2017-22. Passed 11-28-17.)
1141.05 EFFECT OF DISTRICT.
   Upon the effective date of an ordinance passed by Village Council
establishing a neighborhood conservation district, no new rental registration
for single-family detached dwellings under Chapter
1337 of the Codified Ordinances shall be permitted. Any single-family rental
property that registered prior to the effective date of the ordinance and
maintains such registration current shall be allowed to continue use or
occupancy of such single-family detached dwelling unit as rental property in
accordance with the laws existing prior to the effective date of the ordinance
establishing the district. No existing registered rental single-family detached
dwelling unit in a district shall be considered to be a nonconforming use as a
result of adoption of an ordinance creating the district. In the event an owner
of rental property, either intentionally or unintentionally, allows a rental
registration to expire and more than one (1) year passes without renewal of the
rental registration, any subsequent use of the property must comply with the
restrictions imposed by the district. It shall be the sole responsibility of
the property owner to know the status of registration and to renew such
registration prior to expiration.
(Ord. 2017-22. Passed 11-28-17.)
1141.06 AMENDMENTS TO AN EXISTING DISTRICT.
   (a)   Adding Parcels to an Existing District. Properties that are adjacent
to an existing neighborhood conservation district may be added to the district,
and those property owners may file a petition and follow the procedures as
described in Section

CHAPTER 1163
Nonconforming Uses, Buildings, Lots and Structures
1163.01   Purpose.
1163.02   Nonconforming buildings or structures.
1163.03   Nonconforming use of buildings or land.
1163.04   Nonconforming parking facilities.
1163.05   Nonconforming signs.
1163.06   Nonconforming lots.
1163.07   Nonconforming use due to reclassification.
1163.08   Change from nonconforming use.
1163.09   Determination of nonconforming status.
1163.10   Existing use deemed conditional use; permit required for change.
1163.11   Completion of construction with zoning permit.
1163.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to recognize the existence of uses,
buildings, lots and structures that lawfully existed at the time of the
enactment of this Planning and Zoning Code, or amendment thereto, but which now
do not conform with one or more of the regulations contained in this Planning
and Zoning Code. Nonconfom1ing status is considered to be incompatible with
permitted uses in the zoning district in which it exists. Therefore,
nonconforming uses, buildings, lots, and structures are subject to regulations
limiting their use, restoration, reconstruction, extension, and substitution.
Such nonconforming status shall be continued only in conformance with this
Chapter.
   A nonconforming lot, use, building or structure does not include
nonconformity with regulations pursuant to a legally granted variance from a
zoning regulation.
(Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1163.02 NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES.
   A nonconforming building or other structure may continue to be occupied by a
use permitted in the district in which it is located so long as it remains
otherwise lawful and does not constitute a public nuisance subject to the
following provisions:
   (a)    Additions and Moving. A nonconfonning building or structure shall not
be added to, enlarged or moved unless the addition or part moved is made to
conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. In the event
an applicant proposes to alter, add to, enlarge or move a nonconforming
building or structure and a development plan is required pursuant to Section
1107.02, any nonconforming site condition that exists on the same lot shall be
brought into compliance with district regulations unless the Zoning Inspector.
Village Solicitor and Mayor determine that such confonnance cannot be
reasonably achieved. In such case, the Zoning Inspector. Village Solicitor and
Mayor shall approve a development plan that reduces the existing nonconforming
site condition to the maximum extent practicable.
   (b)    Replacement or Restoration of Damaged Building or Structure. If a
nonconforming building or structure is damaged or destroyed by any cause, those
portions so destroyed or damaged may be restored or replaced to that condition
existing immediately prior to such damage or destruction with respect to floor
area, location, height and materials. The Zoning Inspector, Village Solicitor
and Mayor shall determine if such restoration, repair, replacement or
reconstruction is consistent with the preexisting condition. All restoration,
repairs, replacement and reconstruction shall be in compliance with the
following conditions:
      (1)   A zoning permit authorizing such work shall be obtained from the
Zoning Inspector.
      (2)    Such work shall be completed within a period of one (1) year from
the date of damage or destruction.
      (3)   Such work shall not cause a new nonconformity, nor shall it
increase the degree of nonconformity or noncompliance existing prior to such
damage or destruction. (Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1163.03 NONCONFORMING USE OF BUILDINGS OR LAND.
   A nonconforming use may continue so long as it remains otherwise lawful and
does not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   Alteration or Remodeling of a Building Occupied by a Nonconforming
Use. No building or structure containing a nonconforming use shall hereafter be
altered, improved or substantially remodeled unless approved by the Zoning
Inspector, Village Solicitor and Mayor. Before granting such approval, the
Zoning Inspector, Village Solicitor and Mayor shall determine that the proposed
alteration or remodeling will not result in greater detriment to the
surrounding properties and complies with Section
1163.03(a).
   (b)   Damage or Destruction. Any building occupied by a nonconforming use
that has been damaged or destroyed may be restored or replaced to that
condition existing immediately prior to such damage or destruction with respect
to floor area, location, height and materials. The Zoning Inspector, Village
Solicitor and Mayor shall determine if such restoration, repair, replacement or
reconstruction is consistent with the preexisting condition.
   (c)   Expansion of Nonconforming Use of Structures. A nonconforming use of
an existing structure may be extended throughout any parts of a building that
were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or
amendment to this Planning and Zoning Code. However, no such use shall be
extended to occupy any land outside such building not previously occupied by
such nonconforming use. and no such building shall be enlarged or expanded to
increase the nonconforming use except in conformance with subsection (a) above.
   (d)    Expansion or Relocation of Nonconforming Use of Land. A nonconforming
use of land shall not be physically enlarged, increased, extended or relocated
to a part of the lot that was not occupied by the use at the time it became
nonconforming nor beyond the original property limits of the nonconforming use
existing at the time of the adoption of this Planning and Zoning Code. No
additional structures shall be constructed in connection with such
nonconforming use.
   (e)    Change or Substitution of Use. No nonconforming use may be changed to
any other nonconforming use unless the Zoning Inspector, Village Solicitor and
Mayor find that the proposed nonconforming use is equally or more appropriate,
less intensive and less detrimental to the district than the existing
nonconforming use of the property. The Zoning Inspector, Village Solicitor and
Mayor may specify such appropriate conditions and safeguards as may be required
in connection with such change. Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a
less intensive use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a more
intensive nonconforming use.
   (f)    Discontinuance of Use. If a nonconforming use is voluntarily
discontinued for six (6) consecutive months or more, any future use of such
land shall be in conformity with this Planning and Zoning Code and all State
laws relating to zoning.
      (Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1163.04 NONCONFORMING PARKING FACILITIES.
   A building or use existing lawfully at the time this Planning and Zoning
Code, or any amendment thereto, became or becomes effective that does not
comply with the off-street parking regulations for the use may continue without
such parking facilities. In the event an existing building is altered or a use
is changed or substituted in accordance with these regulations, then additional
off-street parking spaces shall be provided so that the nonconforming parking
condition is not increased. (Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1163.05 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   A sign lawfully existing at the time this Planning and Zoning Code, or any
amendment thereto, became or becomes effective but which fails to conform to
the sign regulations of the district in which it is located is a nonconforming
sign. Nonconforming signs shall comply with the regulations set forth in
Section
1165.15.
(Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1163.06 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   A lot of record that does not comply on the effective date of this Planning
and Zoning Code or any amendment thereto with the lot area or lot width
regulations of the district in which the lot is located may be used as follows:
   (a)   Existing Dwelling on a Residential Lot. If the lot is occupied by a
dwelling, such dwelling shall be maintained and may be repaired, modernized or
altered, provided that the building is not enlarged in floor area unless the
enlarged section complies with all regulations of this Planning and Zoning
Code, except the lot area and lot width regulations of the district in which
the lot is located. The number of dwelling units shall not be increased unless
all regulations, including lot area, are complied with.
   (b)   Vacant Single Nonconforming Lot of Record. When a nonconforming lot
can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the
intended use, except that the lot is smaller than the required minimum lot area
and/or lot width set forth in the district regulations, then the lot may be
used as proposed just as if it were conforming. However, no use that requires a
greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for a particular
district shall be permitted on a nonconforming lot.
   (c)   Lots in Combination. If, on the date this section becomes effective,
an undeveloped nonconforming lot adjoins and has continuous frontage with one
or more lots under the same ownership, then neither the owner of the
nonconforming lot nor his successors in interest may take advantage of the
provision of subsection (b). Such nonconforming lot shall be combined with one
or more contiguous lot(s) under the same ownership and be replatted to create
one or more conforming lots. No portion of the enlarged parcel shall be sold
unless both the portion to be sold and the remainder shall be conforming
parcels.
      (Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1163.07 NONCONFORMING USE DUE TO RECLASSIFICATION.
   The provisions of this chapter shall also apply to any building, structure,
land or other use hereafter becoming nonconforming as a result of amendments
made to this Planning and Zoning Code or Zoning Map. (Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-
02.)
1163.08 CHANGE FROM NONCONFORMING USE.
   A nonconforming building or use shall cease to be considered as such
whenever it first comes into compliance with the regulations of the district in
which it is located. Upon such compliance, no nonconforming use shall be made,
resumed or reinstated.
(Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1163.09 DETERMINATION OF NONCONFORMING STATUS.
   At the time of application for a zoning permit or request for variance, or
upon the request of the Zoning Inspector regarding a nonconforming lot,
building, structure or use, the property owner shall submit sufficient evidence
to verify that such lot, building, structure or use was lawfully created or
established in accordance with the zoning regulations in existence at that
time. If the evidence submitted indicates the lot, building, structure or use
was legally established and has since become nonconfonning because of the
establishment of or amendment to this Planning and Zoning Code. the Zoning
Inspector shall issue a Certificate of Nonconforming Use. This certificate
shall specify the reason why the use, building, structure or lot is
nonconforming, and for nonconforming uses shall also include a description of
the extent and kind of use made of the property in question, the portion of the
structure or land used for the nonconforming use, and the extent that
dimensional requirements are nonconforming.
(Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1163.10 EXISTING USE DEEMED CONDITIONAL USE; PERMIT REQUIRED FOR CHANGE.
   Any lawfully existing use that, at the time of its establishment, was
classified as a use permitted by right but which now, because of the passage of
this Planning and Zoning Code or amendment thereto, is listed as a conditional
use in the district in, which it is located, shall be deemed without further
action to be a conditional use. Any change, modification, enlargement or
alteration of such use. site development conditions or signs, or change in
ownership, shall only be permitted upon review and approval by the Planning and
Zoning Commission according to the procedures for conditional uses set forth in
Chapter
1111. (Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1163.11 COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION WITH ZONING PERMIT.
   Nothing in this Planning and Zoning Code shall prohibit the completion of
the construction and use of buildings for which a zoning permit has been issued
prior to the effective date of this Planning and Zoning Code, or amendments
thereto provided the zoning permit remains valid.
(Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)

1165.01 PURPOSES.
   In the interest of promoting the general health, safety and welfare of the
residents of the Village, these regulations are herein established to provide
for the use, location and size of signs in a manner that ensures that signs are
in harmony with the character of the associated use and surrounding area. More
specifically, the purpose of these regulations is to:
   (a)    Promote and maintain attractive, high value residential, business and
industrial districts and preserve the scenic and natural beauty of designated
areas.
   (b)    Provide reasonable, yet appropriate, conditions for identifying
institutions, residential developments, businesses and industrial
establishments.
   (c)    Ensure that signs are located and designed to maintain a safe and
orderly pedestrian and vehicular environment.
   (d)    Eliminate any confusion or hazardous conflict between identification
signs and traffic control signs and devices.
   (e)    Provide review procedures that enable the Village to comprehensively
evaluate the appropriateness of a sign to the site, building and surroundings.
   (f)    Prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this Chapter.
   In establishing these purposes, the Village has determined that no sign
shall be permitted as a main or accessory use except in accordance with the
provisions of this Planning and Zoning Code. Any sign that does not conform
with these regulations, or any subsequent amendment thereto, is a public
nuisance and, as such, must be removed in compliance with these regulations.
Nonconforming signs are unduly distracting to motorists and pedestrians, and
thereby create a traffic hazard and reduce the effectiveness of signs needed to
direct the public.
   The regulations contained in this Chapter are the minimum regulations
necessary to abate the nuisance and to achieve the stated purpose of this
Chapter.

and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area or dimensions
shall include the entire portion within such background or frame.
      (2)    For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures, logos or
elements on a wall or similar surface of the building or structure, or an
irregular shaped freestanding sign, the area of the sign shall encompass a
regular, or a combination of regular geometric shapes which form or approximate
the perimeter of all the elements in the display. When separate elements are
organized to form a single sign, but the elements are separated by open space,
the area shall be calculated by determining the geometric form, or combination
of forms, which comprise all the display areas, including the space between the
elements.
      (3)    The sign area shall include the frame but shall not include the
pole or other structural support unless such pole or structural support
illuminated or otherwise so designated to constitute a display device.

(2) identical sign faces are placed back to back so that both faces cannot be
viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of
the same sign structure and are not more than forty-two (42) inches apart, the
sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
   (b)    Determining Sign Height. The height of a sign shall be measured from
the base of the sign or supportive structure at its point of attachment to the
ground to the top most element of the sign. A freestanding sign on a man-made
base, including a graded earth mound, shall be measured from the grade of the
nearest street, drive or parking area.
   (c)    Determining Clearance of a Sign: The smallest vertical distance
between the grade of the adjacent street or street curb and the lowest point of
any sign including framework and embellishments, extending over that grade.
   (d)    Determining Building Frontage and Building Unit. The length of the
building that faces the principal street or the length of the wall of the
building that contains the main entrance to the uses therein shall be
considered the building frontage.
      (1)   The building frontage shall be measured along the front wall
between the exterior faces of the exterior side walls.
      (2)    In the case of an irregular wall surface, a straight line extended
along such wall surface shall be used to measure the length.
      (3)    For buildings including more than one business, the front width of
each individual business unit shall be used to determine the maximum sign area
for the business. The building frontage for a business unit shall be measured
from the centerline of the party walls defining the building unit.
   (e)    Architectural Features. Architectural features that are either part
of the building or part of a freestanding structure are not considered signs
and are thus exempt from these regulations. An architectural feature is any
construction attending to, but not an integral part of the sign, and which may
consist of landscaping or building or structural forms complementing the site
in general.

1167.01 PURPOSE.
   Off-street parking regulations are established to achieve, among others, the
following:
   (a)    To relieve congestion so streets can be utilized more fully for
movement of vehicular traffic;
   (b)    To promote the safety and convenience of pedestrians and shoppers by
separating parking areas and extensive car movements in the vicinity of
pedestrian ways;
   (c)    To protect adjoining residential neighborhoods from on-street
parking; and
   (d)    To promote the general convenience, welfare and prosperity of
residential, business, service and manufacturing developments which depend on
off-street parking facilities. (Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1167.02 PARKING FACILITIES REQUIRED.
   Accessory off-street parking facilities, including access driveways, shall
be provided prior to the occupancy of such building or use. The regulations in
this Chapter shall apply to all parking spaces, lots, garages, buildings or
portions thereof. Such facilities shall be provided for the entire building or
use in accordance with the regulations contained in this Chapter whenever:
   (a)    A building is newly constructed.
   (b)    An existing building is altered and there is an increase in the
seating capacity, floor area of the building, number of dwelling units or
number of employees.
   (c)    The use of an existing building is changed to a use requiring more
parking facilities. (Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1167.03 UNITS OF MEASURE.
   In computing the number of parking spaces required by this Planning and
Zoning Code, the following rules shall apply:
   (a)    Floor Area. Where floor area is designated as the standard for
determining parking space requirements, gross floor area shall be used for all
land uses.
   (b)    Seating Capacity. Where seating capacity is the standard for
determining parking space requirements, the capacity shall mean the number of
seating units installed or indicated, or one (1) seat for each twenty-four (24)
lineal inches of benches or pews. When fixed seating is not indicated, the
capacity shall be determined as being one (1) seat for each twenty (20) square
feet of floor area of the assembly room. Where the Fire Code establishes a
greater maximum seating capacity, the number of spaces provided shall comply
with the Fire Code maximum seating capacity.
   (c)    Employees. Where employees are the standard for determining parking
space requirements, employees shall mean the maximum number of employees on any
two (2) successive shifts.
   (d)    Fractional Numbers. Where the computation results in a fractional
unit the number shall be increased to the next whole number.
   (e)    Parking for Mixed Uses. A building or group of buildings containing
two (2) or more uses, operating normally during the same hours, and which have
different off-street parking requirements, may jointly provide spaces for not
less than the sum of the spaces required for each use.
      (Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1167.04 REQUIRED OFF-STREET PARKING SPACES.
   The required number of off-street parking spaces for each facility or use
shall be determined by application of the standards noted in Schedule
1167.04. For a use not specified in Schedule
1167.04, the Zoning Inspector shall apply the standard for a specified use
which is most similar to the proposed use.

single-family or two-family dwelling
(Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1167.05 ALLOWANCE FOR SHARED PARKING.
   Parking spaces that are designed and developed to comply with the
requirements for one building or use shall not be counted as fulfilling the
parking requirement of another building or use except as specifically permitted
in this section. The Zoning Inspector may approve a development plan with a
reduction in the number of parking spaces required if it can be shown
that the lesser number of spaces is appropriate and consistent with these
regulations and when it
is determined that:
   (a)    In a mixed-use project or a single-use project for which the
different components of the use have different parking requirements, because of
varying peak demands, the uses can be adequately accommodated with a lesser
number of parking spaces than that which is required based on the sum of the
various uses computed separately.
   (b)    The required parking spaces for a proposed use can be accommodated on
an adjacent or nearby site that is not normally open or operated during the
same hours provided that binding arrangements have made between the business
owners and property owners of such uses. The binding agreement shall specify
the parking spaces that shall be shared. Not more than fifty percent (50%) of
the parking spaces required for one use may be assigned to a use that operates
at different hours.
      (Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1167.06 SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR THE B-1 DOWNTOWN DISTRICT.
   In recognition of the historic, compact character of buildings in the B-
1 Downtown district, as well as the less efficient use of the floor area of
those buildings, the Zoning Inspector or Planning and Zoning Commission may
approve a development plan with a reduction in the requirements of Schedule
1167.04, Required Off-Street Parking Spaces. In making such a determination,
the Zoning Inspector or Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the
following criteria.
   (a)    The character of the proposed use, the design of the building and the
ability of the proposed use to reinforce the downtown street environment.
   (b)    The availability and accessibility of public parking spaces, both on-
street and within public parking lots.
   (c)    The availability of parking areas on adjacent sites, considering the
hours of operation of the proposed use compared to adjacent uses.
   (d)    The potential negative impact to the character of the downtown
district if the requisite number of parking spaces is provided.
      (Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1167.07 DEFERRED CONSTRUCTION OF REQUIRED SPACES.
   If the number of parking spaces required in Schedule
1167.04 is substantially larger than the number anticipated by the applicant
and the applicant provides sufficient evidence that supports
the reduced parking needs, a zoning permit may be approved with a lesser number
of parking spaces provided with the exception of the provisions set forth in
Section
1167.05.
   (a)    That the total number of spaces initially provided shall not be less
than seventy (70%) percent of the spaces required by Schedule
1167.04.
   (b)    That suitable area(s) are reserved for the construction of the
balance of the total number of spaces otherwise required by Schedule
1167.04.
   (c)    Any change in use shall require the construction of the total parking
spaces required by this Chapter unless the zoning permit is approved otherwise.
      (Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1167.08 LOCATION OF REQUIRED SPACES.
   In addition to specific requirements contained in each district regulation,
off-street parking, whether open or enclosed, shall be provided upon the same
parcel of land containing the use for which it is required, or on separate
parcels in compliance with the following regulations:
   (a)   General. No off-street parking space shall be used, or designed,
arranged or constructed to be used, in a manner that will obstruct or interfere
with the free use of any street alley, or adjoining property.
   (b)   Residential Districts. Within a 200 foot radius in all residential
districts.
   (c)   Business and Industrial Districts. Within a 600 foot radius in all
business and industrial districts.
      (Ord. 2002-2. Passed 1-24-02.)
1167.09 REGULATIONS FOR ACCESS DRIVES.
   Each parking space and loading space shall be provided access in accordance
with the following:
   (a)   Number of Drives. Each lot shall be permitted one two-way access drive
or a pair of one-way drives. For lots with more than 100 feet of frontage on
one street, one additional two-way drive or pair of one-way drives may be
permitted.
   (b)   Width.
      (1)   Residential Districts. Private driveways, for single-family and
two-family dwellings shall not exceed twelve (12) feet.
      (2)   Multi-family and Nonresidential Uses. The width of access drives
for multi-family dwellings and non-residential uses shall be not less than ten
(10) feet and shall have a total width of not more than thirty-six (36) feet,
measured at the property line.
   (c)   Location. Access drives shall be located to minimize traffic
congestion and avoid undue interference with pedestrian access to street
corners. Access drives on corner lots shall be located as far from the street
intersection as practicable; and no access drive shall be located within fifty
(50) feet of street intersections as measured from the intersection of the
street right-of-way lines. An access drive shall be located no closer than ten
(10) feet to a residential district, and the resulting adjacent open area shall
be landscaped in accordance with the landscaping requirements for the district
in which it is located.
   (d)   Design. Unobstructed and direct access ways shall be provided to the
parking lot or garage from a street or alley. Access roadways or driveways
shall be approximately perpendicular to the street or alley at the right-of-way
line.
   (e)   Access to Off-Street Loading Spaces. Access to all designated off-
street loading spaces from a public street or alley shall be provided. Access
ways shall be at least fourteen (14) feet in width. Such access ways may be
coincidental with access roadways or driveways to parking areas.

1323.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Council of
the Village of Mingo Junction, State of Ohio does ordain as follows:
(Ord. 2001-36. Passed 8-23-01.)
 
1323.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (a)   The flood hazard areas of the Village of Mingo Junction are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
   (b)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazards resulting in increases in flood heights and
velocities and, when inadequately anchored, such obstructions damage uses in
other areas. Uses that are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
(Ord. 2001- 36. Passed 8-23-01.)
1323.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 2001-36. Passed 8-23-01.)
1323.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Ord. 2001- 36. Passed 8-23-01.)
1323.05 DEFINITIONS.

which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average,
equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   (w)   "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or

1323.06 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Lands to Which This Chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of Mingo
Junction as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development referenced in subsection (b)
hereof, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
Village of Mingo Junction.
(Ord. 2001-36. Passed 8-23-01.)
   (b)   Basis for Establishing The Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of
special flood hazard have been identified by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled “Flood Insurance Study
Jefferson County and Incorporated Areas” effective April 5, 2006. This study,
with accompanying “Flood Insurance Rate Maps Jefferson County and Incorporated
Areas” effective April 5, 2006, and any revisions thereto, is hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance. The Flood Insurance
Study is on file at 501 Commercial St., Mingo Junction, Ohio 43938.
(Ord. 2006-04. Passed 2-14-06.)
   (c)   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and all other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter, unless
specifically exempted from filing for a development permit as stated in Section
1323.07 (b).
   (d)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (e)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      (1)    Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)    Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of this chapter may be in conflict with a
state law, such state law shall take precedence over the chapter.
   (f)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the Village of Mingo Junction, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (g)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of this chapter
or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall constitute a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree. Any person who violates this chapter or fails
to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall upon conviction
thereof be fined or imprisoned as provided by the laws of the Village of Mingo
Junction. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate
offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Village of Mingo Junction
from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation. The Village of Mingo Junction shall prosecute any violation of this
chapter in accordance with the penalties stated herein.
   (h)   Severability. Should any section or provision of this chapter be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any part thereof other
than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2001-36. Passed 8-23-01.)

governmental agencies from which prior approval is required. The applicant
shall be responsible for obtaining such permits as required including permits
issued by the Department of the Army under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors
Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
         C.   Review all development permit applications to determine if the
proposed development is located within a designated floodway. Floodways are
delineated in the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map or the Flood Insurance Rate
Map of the Flood Insurance Study. Floodways may also be delineated in other
sources of flood information. If the proposed development is located within a
designated floodway, assure that the encroachment provision of Section
1323.08(c)(1) is met.
         D.   Inspect all development projects before, during, and after
construction to ensure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure
compliance with all provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   Use of other base flood elevation and floodway data. Areas of
special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency in accordance with Section
1323.06 (b), are designated as Zone A on the Flood Insurance Rate Map. Within
these areas, the Zoning Inspector shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize
any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or
other source, including data obtained under Section
1323.08 (b)(6), in order to administer Section
1323.08 (b)(1) and (2); and where floodway data are available, administer
Section
1323.08 (c).
      (3)   Information to be obtained and maintained by the Village. Where
base flood elevation data are utilized within areas of special flood hazard on
the Village of Mingo Junction's Flood Insurance Rate Map, regardless of the
source of such data, the Zoning Inspector shall:
         A.   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and record whether or not such structures contain an
enclosure below the lowest floor;
         B.   For all new or substantially-improved flood proofed
nonresidential structures:
            1.   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean
sea level) to which the structure was flood proofed; and,
            2.   Maintain the flood proofing certifications required in
subsection (a)(3) hereof.
         C.   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter, including base flood elevation data, Flood
Insurance Rate Maps and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, variance
documentation, Conditional Letters of Map Revision, Letters of Map Revision,
Letters of Map Amendment, and as-built elevations.
      (4)   Alteration of watercourses.  
         A.   Notify adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A watercourse is
considered to be altered if any change occurs within its banks.
         B.   Maintain engineering documentation required in subsection (a)(4)
that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of said
watercourse will not be diminished.
         C.   Require that necessary maintenance will be provided for the
altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying
capacity will not be diminished.
      (5)   Interpretation of flood boundaries. Make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions). Where a map boundary and field
elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood elevation profile
from the Flood Insurance Study shall prevail. The person contesting the
location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in Section
1323.09.
      (6)   Alteration of community boundaries. Upon occurrence, notify FEMA in
writing whenever the boundaries of the Village of Mingo Junction have been
modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an area, or
no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations
for a particular area. In order that the Village of Mingo Junction's Flood
Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the Village of Mingo Junction's
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the Village of
Mingo Junction suitable for reproduction, clearly delineating the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the Village of Mingo Junction has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.

ready for highway use.
      (5)   Enclosures below the lowest floor. The following standards apply to
all new and substantially improved residential and nonresidential nonbasement
structures which are elevated to the base flood elevation using pilings,
columns, posts, or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to
allow unimpeded movement of flood waters. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest
floor that are useable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding
shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for
meeting this requirement must:
         A.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or,
         B.   Must meet or exceed the following criteria:

in accordance with standard engineering practices;
         B.   If subsection (b)(6)A. hereof is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of subsections (a) and (b).
   (c)   Floodways.
      (1)   Area with floodways. The Flood Insurance Study referenced in
Section
1323.06(b) identifies a segment within areas of special flood hazard known as a
floodway. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of flood
information as specified in Section
1323.07(d)(2). The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of flood waters which carry debris, projectiles, and cause erosion. The
following provisions apply within all delineated floodway areas:
         A.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practices
demonstrates that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
         B.   If subsection (c)(1)A. hereof is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of subsection (b) hereof.
         C.   Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an
increase in base flood elevations can only be granted upon the prior approval
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Such requests must be submitted by
the Zoning Inspector to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and must meet
the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
      (2)   Areas without floodways. In all areas of special flood hazard where
the Flood Insurance Study provides base flood elevation data as set forth in
Section
1323.06(b), but no floodways have been designated, the following provisions
apply:
         A.   New construction, substantial improvements, or other development
(including fill) shall only be permitted if it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.
         B.   If subsection (c)(2)A. hereof is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of Section
1323.08.
1323.09 VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeal Board.
      (1)    The Zoning Board of Appeals as established by the Village of Mingo
Junction shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter.
      (2)    The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it
is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the Zoning Inspector in the enforcement or administration of this
chapter.
      (3)    Those aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals or
any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Jefferson County Court of Common
Pleas, as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (4)    In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant
factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and,
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (5)    Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (a)(4) hereof and
the purposes of this chapter, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
      (6)   The Zoning Inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
upon request.
   (b)   Conditions for Variances. 
      (1)    Variances may only be issued where due to physical characteristics
of the property compliance with the requirements of this chapter creates an
exceptional hardship. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the
requirements of this chapter do not constitute an exceptional hardship.
      (2)    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (3)    Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (4)    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (a)(4) hereof have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (5)    Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (6)    Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in subsection (a)(4)
hereof, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and,
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (7)    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.

(Ord. 2003-27. Passed 8-14-03.)
1329.04 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD.
   (a)   The Design Review Board shall annually select one of its members to
serve as chairperson and one as vice chairperson. The Mayor shall provide such
staff assistance as is necessary and available. All municipal departments and
agencies shall cooperate in expediting the work of the Design Review Board.
   (b)   The Design Review Board shall adopt rules and regulations, consistent
with this Chapter, governing its procedures and transactions. The Design Review
Board shall meet as required to carry out the review of applications for
Certificates of Appropriateness, and such other related work as may be accepted
through request of Council or undertaken on its own motion. Meetings shall be
held at least once each month when there are applications to be considered and
not less than once every three months. Special meetings may be held at the call
of the chairperson of the Design Review Board.    
   (c)   Within the boundaries of any Preservation District, the Design Review
Board shall review any proposed new construction and alterations to property as
herein defined. The Board's approval of such new construction and alteration
shall be secured before any owner of property may commence work thereon. In
reviewing proposed alterations to property, the Design Review Board shall at a
minimum use as evaluative criteria, the ten federal standards established by
the Secretary of the U. S. Department of the Interior as follows:
      (1)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property. Requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, or site
and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended purpose.
      (2)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features
should be avoided when possible.
      (3)   All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as
products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which
seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
      (4)   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and
its environment. These changes that may have acquired significance shall be
recognized and respected.
      (5)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure, or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
      (6)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, whenever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features, should be substantiated by historic, physical, or
pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of
different elements from other buildings or structures.
      (7)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
      (8)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by or adjacent to, any project.
      (9)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural materials, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of
the property, neighborhood, or environment.
      (10)   Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures
shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would
be unimpaired.
   (d)   The Design Review Board shall also utilize the U.S. Secretary of
Interior's Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings in their review and
deliberation.
   (e)   The Design Review Board may amend and/or impose more refined design
review criteria with Council approval based on the Preservation District's
predominant architecture, historical significance, and its cultural/
archaeological attributes.
(Ord. 2003-27. Passed 8-14-03.)
1329.05 TRIGGERING MECHANISM FOR DESIGN REVIEW.
   Once a property owner applies for a building permit for an alteration within
the Preservation District, the permit application will be deemed as an
application to the Design Review Board.
(Ord. 2003-27. Passed 8-14-03.)
1329.06 LIMITATIONS ON ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS; CERTIFICATE
OF OCCUPANCY, AND DEMOLITION PERMITS.
   No alteration of any structure of significant exterior architectural feature
thereof in any designated Preservation District shall be undertaken prior to
obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Zoning Department and a
Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued for the Zoning Department for the
construction, reconstruction, alteration, or demolition of any area, place,
site, building, structure, object, or work of art within a designated
Preservation District until the application for such permit is approved by the
Design Review Board through the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness in
the manner prescribed herein.
(Ord. 2003-27. Passed 8-14- 03.)
1329.07 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   When the owner of a property within a Preservation District proposes
new construction or alteration to any portion of a structure within the
District, he/she shall apply first for (through the Zoning Department) and
secure a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Design Review Board. The
application for a Certificate shall be made with the Zoning Inspector, together
with such plans, specifications, and other material as the Design Review Board
may from time to time prescribe.
   (b)   Within forty-five (45) days of filing, the Design Review Board shall
consider the applications, plans, and specifications.
   (c)   If the proposed alteration is determined to have no adverse effect by
the Design Review Board on the Preservation District, and does not violate the
spirit and purpose of these regulations, then the Board Secretary shall issue
the Certificate of Appropriateness. If the Design Review Board fails to act on
an application within sixty (60) days of filing, the application shall be
deemed approved.
   (d)   If the Design Review Board determines that the proposed alteration
will have an adverse effect on the Preservation District, and does violate the
spirit and purpose of these regulations, then the Board shall deny issuance of
the Certificate of Appropriateness.
   (e)   In the event that the Design Review Board determines within the forty-
five (45) day review period that a Certificate of Appropriateness shall not be
issued, it shall forthwith state in its records reasons for such determination
and may include recommendations respecting the proposed construction,
reconstruction, alteration, or demolition of any area, place, building,
structure, site, object, or work of art. The Secretary of the Board shall
forthwith notify the applicant and the Building Department of such
determination and transmit to him/her a certified copy of the reasons for
denial and recommendations, if any, of the Board.
