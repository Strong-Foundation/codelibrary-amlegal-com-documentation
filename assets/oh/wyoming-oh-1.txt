EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the Codified Ordinances of Wyoming was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Wyoming Codified Ordinances is indicated.

   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment

   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re- enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

re- enactments or amendments thereof.

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

by competitive bid, except as otherwise provided herein. Bids shall be taken
after advertising on at least one occasion in a newspaper of general
circulation within the City.
   The ordinance authorizing the sale or lease of any real property may provide
for the submission of bids in any one or more of the following forms:
      (1)    For the purchase of the real property only.
      (2)    For the purchase and development of the real property, in which
event each such bidder shall be required to describe the improvements to be
constructed on the real property, the minimum cost thereof, and the time for
the beginning and completion of the construction thereof.
      (3)    For leasing such real property, either for a term or perpetually,
with or without an option to purchase.
      (4)    For leasing such real property, either for a term or perpetually,
with or without an option to purchase, and the development thereof. Each such
bidder shall be required to describe the improvements to be constructed on the
real property, the minimum cost thereof and the time for the beginning and
completion of the construction thereof.
   In those cases where bids are accepted for the lease and development of real
property or the sale and development of real property, the conveyances shall
contain appropriate provisions requiring the construction of the improvements
described in the bid within the time limits set forth therein, and the
forfeiture of title to the City in the event such provisions are not complied
with.
   In all cases, the bids submitted shall be referred to Council with the
recommendation of the City Manager, and Council may accept the bid which it
considers best. The ordinance accepting the best bid shall contain provisions
authorizing the conveyance of the real property to the successful bidder.
   Council may, by ordinance, authorize the sale or leasing, without
competitive bids, of real or personal property in the City, not needed for any
municipal purposes, to the United States of America, the State of Ohio, any
subdivision or agency of the United States or the State of Ohio, or to any
corporation or quasi-corporation not for profit, organized for a public or
charitable purpose, upon such terms as may be deemed proper by Council.
   In those cases in which Council determines that it is for the best interests
of the City, City-owned property may be sold or leased without competitive
bidding.
   The fact that competitive bidding is being eliminated and the reasons why
the public interest requires it shall be stated in any ordinance authorizing a
sale without competitive bids. (Ord. 1796-1983. Passed 10-17-83.)

   (d)    Approximate disbursements of the receipts for the following year.
      (Res. 18-1984. Passed 7-16-84.)
121.03 OPEN MEETINGS AND EXECUTIVE SESSION
   (a)   Open Meetings. All meetings of Council shall be open to the public at
all times, unless otherwise provided by Section 121.22 of the Ohio Revised
Code, as the same may be amended or recodified, and as provided in subsection
(b) herein.
   (b)   Executive Session. Council may hold an executive session for the sole
purpose of the consideration of any of the following matters:
      (1)   To consider the appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline,
promotion, demotion, evaluation, or compensation of a public employee or
official, or the investigation of charges or complaints against a public
employee, official, licensee, or regulated individual. Except as otherwise
provided by law, no public body shall hold an executive session for the
discipline of an elected official for conduct related to the performance of the
elected official's official duties or for the elected official's removal from
office.
      (2)   To consider the purchase of property for public purposes or the
sale of property at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of information
would give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a person whose
personal, private interest is adverse to the general public interest. No member
of a public body shall use this subsection as a subterfuge for providing covert
information to prospective buyers or sellers. A purchase or sale of public
property is void if the seller or buyer of the public property has received
covert information from a member of a public body that has not been disclosed
to the general public in sufficient time for other prospective buyers and
sellers to prepare and submit offers.
If the minutes show that all meetings and deliberations were conducted in
compliance with this section, any instrument executed by the City purporting to
convey, lease, or otherwise dispose of any right, title, or interest in any
public property shall be conclusively presumed to have been executed in
compliance with this section insofar as title or other interest of any bona
fide purchasers, lessees, or transferees of the property is concerned.
      (3)   Conferences with an attorney for the public body concerning
disputes involving the City that are the subject of pending or imminent court
action, or that pertain to any other legal matter requiring the attention of
Council;
      (4)   Preparing for, conducting, or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment;
      (5)   Matters required to be kept confidential by federal law or
regulations or state statutes;
      (6)   Details relative to the security arrangements and emergency
response protocols for a public body or a public office, if disclosure of the
matters discussed could reasonably be expected to jeopardize the security of
the public body or public office;
      (7)   To consider confidential information related to economic
development issues where the executive session is necessary to protect the
interests of an applicant for economic assistance or the possible investment or
expenditure of public funds made in connection with the economic development
project.
      (8)   Where Council is sitting to decide an issue or matter in a quasi-
judicial proceeding, but only after all of the evidence to come before such
body has been heard.
   (c)   Procedure. Council may hold an executive session only after a majority
of a quorum of Council determines, by roll call vote, to hold such executive
session.

by the Finance Director.
   (b)   Approval procedure for alterations or modifications. An alternation or

   Pursuant to Section
4.06  of the Wyoming Charter, the following procedures shall apply to contracts
that require competitive bidding:
   (a)   Time between Notice and Bid Opening. There shall be no minimum time
requirement between the publishing of the notice and the opening of bids. The
City shall notify prospective bidders of the bid opening date and time in the
Notice and shall adjust the same to meet the needs of the City by issuing
Addenda when necessary.
   (b)   Addenda Do Not Extend Bid Opening. The City may issue such addenda to
the bid documents as it feels necessary and such addenda may be issued up to
and including the last business day before the bid opening without any
extension of the bid opening date. Addenda issued the same day as the bid
opening shall cause the bid opening date to be extended to the date and time
set forth in such addenda.
   (c)   Estimate of Cost. The City shall disclose the estimated cost of the

   (d)   Time for Award of Bids. In the notice required for the bid
solicitation, the City shall establish the time limit for awarding a contract.
Submitted bids may not be withdrawn during this time period. The City's failure
to award and execute the contract within this period invalidates the entire bid
proceedings and all bids submitted, unless the time for awarding and executing
the contract is extended by mutual consent of the City and the bidder whose bid
the City accepts and with respect to whom the City subsequently awards and
executes a contract. Such extension shall not entitle the contractor to delay
costs.
   (e)   Withdrawal of Bids. Bidders may withdraw bids pursuant to Section 9.31
of the Ohio Revised Code; such withdrawal shall not modify the City's right to
award to the next lowest and best bidder.
   (f)   Bids in Excess of Estimate. The City may award contracts regardless of
the value of the bid as compared to the value of the estimated cost.
   (g)   Bonus and Liquidated Damages for Time. The City may offer a bonus for
completion of a contract prior to a specified date, or may exact liquidated
damages for each day of delay beyond a specified date, or both. The amounts of
the bonus and liquidated damages may be different.
   (h)   Return of Bid Guarantees. The City shall return bid guarantees to
bidders to which it does not award a contract in a reasonably timely manner.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
high- ways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)    Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more than six
months, or
   (b)    Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. C1. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex reI. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing. a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions. or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality.”
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): “Where transfer is required, the mayor’s court shall make a written
order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court, continuing the
same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee court a
condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor’s court shall transmit to
the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers in the case
and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the clerk of the
transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the defendant by
ordinary mail of his trial date.”
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.
171.01   Witness, payout and court cost fees.
171.02   Failure to appear; capias and penalty.
171.03   Failure to pay fine on time; capias and penalty.

Kasich on December 19, 2014, and Am Sub HB 64, passed by the 131st General
Assembly, and signed by Governor Kasich on June 30, 2015. These amendments
required municipal corporations to conform to and adopt the provisions ORC 718
in order to have the authority to impose, enforce, administer and collect a
municipal income tax.
      (2)    As mandated by the above amendments, the City passed Ordinance No.
13- 2015, effective January 1, 2016, which comprehensively amended Chapter 181
in accordance with the provisions of ORC 718 to allow the City to continue the

Section 803.100, purporting to require that municipalities, on or before
January 31, 2018, adopt certain municipal income tax provisions to authorize
state officials to collect and administer municipal net profit taxes. Section
803.100 of House Bill 49 references and relies upon 718.04(A) of the Ohio
Revised Code, which purports to make municipal income taxing authority
conditional upon a municipality's adoption of code sections as dictated by the
state.
      (5)    As mandated by the above amendments, the City passed Ordinance
2018-01 which amends Chapter 181 to adopt the required code sections to
authorize state officials to collect and administer the net profit taxes due to
the City.
      (6)    Ordinance 2018-01 does not repeal the existing sections of Chapter
181 for any taxable year prior to 2018, but rather amends Chapter
181 effective January 1, 2018. For taxable years beginning before January 1,
2018, the City shall continue to administer, audit, and enforce the income tax
of the city under R.C. Chapter 718 and chapters and resolutions of the city as
that ORC 718 and those chapters and resolutions existed before January 1, 2018.
      (7)   Ordinance 2023-16, effective January 1, 2024, and corresponding
changes to ORC 718, apply to municipal taxable years beginning on or after
January 1, 2024, except as otherwise provided herein. All provisions of this
Chapter
181 apply to taxable years beginning 2024 and succeeding taxable year.
      (8)   Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, Ordinance 2023-16
does not repeal the existing sections of Chapter
181 for any taxable year prior to 2024, but rather amends Chapter
181 effective January 1, 2024. For taxable years beginning before January 1,
2024, the City shall continue to administer, audit, and enforce the income tax
of the City under R.C. Chapter 718 and chapters and resolutions of the City as
that ORC 718 and those chapters and resolutions existed before January 1, 2024.

interest, interest penalty, or other similar assessment or charge shall be
levied against a taxpayer for the late payment or nonpayment of estimated tax
liability if one of the following applies:
         A.   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the municipal
corporation but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the
current calendar year; or
         B.   The taxpayer has timely remitted, pursuant to this section, an
amount at least equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the taxpayer's tax
liability for the preceding year as shown on the return filed by the taxpayer
for the preceding year, provided that the return for the preceding year
reflected a twelve-month period and the taxpayer filed a return for the
preceding year; or
      (4)   A declaration may be amended at any time, provided, however, that
in case an amended declaration is filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon
shall be paid in equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
   
   (d) An amended declaration must be filed on or before January 31 of any
year, or in the case a taxpayer on a fiscal year accounting basis, on or before
the date fixed by regulation of the Tax Administrator, if it appears that the
original declaration made by such year underestimated the taxpayer's income by
thirty percent (30%) or more. At such time a payment shall be made which,
together with prior payments, is sufficient to pay the taxpayer's entire
estimated liability. If, upon the filing of the return required by Section
181.09 it appears that the taxpayer did not pay ninety percent (90%) of the
taxpayer's tax liability for the current year or one-hundred percent (100%) of
the taxpayer's liability of the preceding year on or before January 31, or the
date fixed by regulation, whichever is applicable, the difference between
ninety percent (90%) of such taxpayer's tax liability and the amount of
estimated tax the taxpayer actually paid on or before January 31, or the date
fixed by regulation, whichever is applicable, shall be subject to the interest
and penalty provision of Section
181.12.
   (e)   On or before the last day of the fourth month of the calendar or
fiscal year following that for which the declaration was filed, an annual
return shall be filed and any balance which may be due the City shall be paid
therewith in accordance with the provisions of Section
181.09. (Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)
181.09 RETURNS AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
    (a)   Time for Filing. Each taxpayer, except as herein provided, shall,
whether or not a tax be due thereon, make and file a return on or before April
15 of the year following the effective date of this chapter and each year
thereafter. When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period different
from the calendar year, the return shall be filed by the fifteenth day of the
fourth month following the end of such fiscal year or period.
   (b)   The return shall be filed with the Tax Administrator on a form or
forms prescribed by or obtainable upon request from the Tax Administrator or a
generic form setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned, and gross income from any business, profession or other
activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such gross
income, earned during the preceding year and subject to such tax;
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such gross income,
earnings, and profits;
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns or other
information as the Tax Administrator may require, including a statement that
the figures used in the return are the figures used in the return for State
and/or Federal income tax, adjusted to set forth only such income as is taxable
under the provisions of this chapter.
         A.   A taxpayer who is an individual may be required to include, with
each annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
Section
181.09, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form 1040 or Ohio IT 1040; and
         B.   A taxpayer that is not an individual may be required to include,
with each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for
refund required under this Section 181.09, copies of only the following
documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form
1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an
amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary to
support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return;
      (4)    Each individual return shall have attached to it a copy of the
taxpayer's Ohio State Individual Income Tax return for the same year and
documentation of any Section
181.04 exceptions taken by the taxpayer.
   (c)    Extensions.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the
extended due date of the City's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an
individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of
the taxable year to which the return relates.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for
a period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
      (3)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (4)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
      (5)    If the State Tax Administrator extends for all taxpayers the date
for filing state income tax returns under division (G) of R.C. § 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City
income tax return. The extended due date of the City income tax return shall be
the same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
      (6)    Taxpayers subject to the tax on Net Profits may file for an
extension through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (7)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under sections (c)(1) or (c)(5), the Tax Administrator shall
not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer with regard to the
return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return or on or before the
extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs first.
If a tax administrator violates division (c)(7) of this section, the City shall
reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to respond to such
inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         Division (c)(7) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (c)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (c)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (c)(3) of this section.
   (d)   Payment with returns. 
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon;
provided, however that where any portion of the tax so due shall have been paid
by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.06 the amount shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only
the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return.
      (2)   Overpayments and refunds. A taxpayer who has over-paid the amount
of tax to which the City is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may
have the overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at
his election indicated on the return, the overpayment (or part thereof) shall
be refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than $10
shall be collected or refunded.
   (e)   Amended returns. 
      (1)   Where necessary an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in Sections
181.12 and
181.17. The amended returns shall be on a form obtained on request from the Tax
Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three months after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City of Wyoming, Ohio, tax
liability, the taxpayer shall make and file an amended return showing income
subject to the city tax based upon the final determination of federal or state
tax liability, and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for
refund of any overpayment.
   (f)   Rental Reports.
      (1)   In order to enable the City to collect income tax revenue, all
property owners of rental property who rent apartments, rooms and/or make other
rental accommodations shall file with the Tax Administrator of the City, a
report showing the names, addresses and telephone numbers, if available, of
each such tenant who occupies an apartment, room, or other rental property
within the corporate limits of the City. Such report must be filed with the Tax
Administrator within thirty days after a new tenant occupies rental property of
any kind located within the City.
      (2)   Within thirty days after a tenant vacates an apartment, room, or
other rental property located within the City, the property owner of such
vacated rental property shall file a report with the Tax Administrator showing
the date of vacation from the rental property and identifying each vacating
tenant.
      (3)   Whoever violates this section (f) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
         (Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-26-18; Ord. 16-2023. Passed 12-18-23.)

all taxes owing to the City, to keep accurate records for a minimum of five
years showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to file a declaration

Administrator to destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the
manner authorized by law.
   (b)    Enforcement. The Tax Administrator is charged with the enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter and is hereby empowered, subject to the approval
of the Board of Review, to adopt and promulgate and to enforce rules and
regulations relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the collection of
taxes and the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter,
including provisions for the reexamination and correction of returns.
   (c)    Determination of Amount of Taxes. 
      (1)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has
filed a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Tax
Administrator may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due the City from
the taxpayer, and shall send to the taxpayer a written statement showing the
amount of tax so determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if
any.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may exercise the authority provided by law,
including orders from bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding
taxes, including penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously
imposed or collected, or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the
Tax Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written

181.11  INVESTIGATIVE POWER OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR; IDENTIFICATION
INFORMATION; PENALTY FOR DIVULGING    CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   (a)    Examination of Records. The Tax Administrator, or any authorized
employee, is authorized to examine the books, papers records, and federal
income tax returns of any employer or of any taxpayer or person subject to, or
whom the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter, for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made, or if no
return was made, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Every such
employer, supposed employer, taxpayer, or supposed taxpayer is hereby directed
and required to furnish upon written request by the Tax Administrator, or his
duly authorized agent or employee, the means, facilities, and opportunity for
making the examinations and investigations as are hereby authorized.
   (b)    Power to Order Appearance of Taxpayer. The Tax Administrator is
authorized to order any person presumed to have knowledge of the facts to
appear before him and may examine the person, under oath, concerning any income
which was or should have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending
to affect the income, and for this purpose may compel the production of books,
papers, records, and federal income tax returns and the attendance of all
persons before him, whether as parties or witnesses, whenever he believes such
persons have knowledge of the income or information pertinent to the inquiry.
The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant,
bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This
Section
181.11(b) does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an
attorney.
   (c)    Identifying Information. When transmitting or otherwise making use of
a tax document that contains a person's social security number, the Tax
Administrator shall take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that the
number is not capable of being viewed by the general public, including, when
necessary, masking the number so that it is not readily discernible by the
general public. The Tax Administrator shall not put a person's social security
number on the outside of any material mailed to the person.
   (d)    Failure to Submit Identifying Information Required by Tax
Administrator. 
      (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
181.10, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
181.19 of this chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (a) of this Section
181.11 within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
181.12 of this chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (d)(1) and (2) of this
Section
181.11 may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
181.19 of this Chapter
181 for fraud and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
   (e)    Failure to Submit Information Required by Tax Administrator. The
refusal to produce books, papers, records, and federal income tax returns, or
the refusal to submit to the examination by any employer or person subject or
presumed to be subject to the tax or by any officer, agent, or employee of a
person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax, or the failure of any
person to comply with the provisions of this Section
181.11 or with an order or subpoena of the Tax Administrator authorized hereby
shall be deemed a violation of this chapter, punishable as provided in Section
181.14.
   (f)    Confidential Nature of Information; Penalty for Disclosure. 
      (1)   Any information gained as the result of any returns,
investigations, hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this
chapter shall be confidential, except for official purposes, or except in
accordance with the proper judicial order. Any person divulging the information
in violation of this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, be deemed guilty
of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine or penalty of not more than
$1,000 or imprisoned for not more than six months, or both. Each disclosure
shall constitute a separate offense.
      (2)   In addition to the above penalty, any employee of the City, who
violates the provisions of this Section
181.11 relative to the disclosure of confidential information shall be guilty
of an offense punishable by immediate dismissal.
   (g)    Retention of records. Each and every taxpayer shall retain all
records necessary to compute his tax liability for a period of up to six years
from the date his return is filed or the withholding taxes are paid. A taxpayer
may destroy records before the end of the six year period with the written
consent of the Tax Administrator. (Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)
181.12 INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (a)    Interest. All taxes imposed and all moneys withheld or required to be
withheld by employers under the provisions of this chapter and remaining unpaid
after they become due shall bear interest at the maximum rate permitted under
R.C. § 718.27 per annum, or fraction thereof.
   (b)    Penalties. In addition to interest as provided in division (a) of
this Section
181.12, penalties based on the unpaid tax are hereby imposed as follows:
      (1)   (a)    For tax years ending on or before December 31, 2022, for
failure to file a return by the dates prescribed herein, including any
extension of time granted by the Tax Administrator, whether or not a tax is
due, unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause, and not to
willful neglect, a penalty of not less than twenty- five dollars shall be
assessed by the Tax Administrator. For each month a return remains unfiled, an
additional penalty of twenty- five dollars may be assessed, up to a maximum of
$150.00. § 718.27(C)(2)(a)
         (b)    For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, with respect
to returns other than estimated income tax returns, the City may impose a
penalty not exceeding twenty-five dollars for each failure to timely file each
return, regardless of the liability shown thereon, except that the City shall
abate or refund the penalty assessed on a taxpayer's first failure to timely
file a return after the taxpayer files that return.
      (2)   For failure to pay taxes due, other than taxes withheld, the
penalty permitted by R.C. § 718.27(C)(2)(a), as amended from time to time.
      (3)   For failure to remit taxes withheld from employees, the penalty
permitted by R.C. § 718.27(C)(2)(b), as amended from time to time.
   (c)    Exceptions. A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional tax
assessment made by the Tax Administrator when a return has been filed in good
faith and the tax paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Tax
Administrator and provided, further, that in the absence of fraud, neither
penalty nor interest shall be assessed on any additional tax assessment
resulting from a federal audit, providing an amended return is filed and the
additional tax is paid within three months after a final determination of the
federal tax liability.
   (d)    Abatement of Penalty, Interest, or Both. Upon recommendation of the
Tax Administrator or upon appeal from the refusal of the Tax Administrator to
so recommend, the Board of Review may abate penalty or interest, or both.
   (e)    In addition to the foregoing penalties, a penalty provided in R.C. §
718.27(C), as amended from time to time, against all taxpayers who fail to file
a return within the time period in this chapter.

181.13 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)    Limitation on Actions. All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be
collectible, together with any interest and penalties thereon, by suit, as
other debts of like amount are recoverable. Except in the case of fraud,
omission of a substantial portion of income subject to this tax, or failure to
file a return, an additional assessment shall not be made after the later of
(1) three years after the tax was due or the return was filed, whichever was
later, and (2) one year after the conclusion of any qualifying deferral period,
as defined in R.C. § 718.12(A)(1)(b)(2); except that, in those cases in which
the Administrator of internal revenue and the taxpayer have executed a waiver
of the federal statute of limitations, the period in which an additional
assessment may be made by the Administrator shall be one year from later of the
time of the final determination of the federal tax liability and the time when
the taxpayer files an amended municipal return as required by R.C. § 718.12(E).
   In cases of fraud, failure to file a return, or the omission of twenty-five
per cent or more of income required to be reported, prosecutions may be
commenced within six years after the commission of the offense.
   (b)    Minimum Amount of Tax to Be Collected. Amounts of less than $10 shall
not be collected or refunded.
   (c)    Time Limitation on Refunds. 
      (1)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for
refund is made within three years from the date on which the payment was made
or the return was due, whichever is later.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
City official for payment. Except as provided in division (c)(3) of this
Section
181.13, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose
request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment shall state the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If the Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under R.C. §
718.11.
   (d)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (c) of this Section
181.13 shall be considered to have been filed in a timely manner if any of the
following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   
   (e)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
R.C. § 718.27(A)(5).
   (f)    Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars.

discretion of the Mayor.
      (2)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for

the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.

appeal the decision, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
      (2)   Any person who is aggrieved by an assessment of the Tax
Administrator may appeal the assessment to the Board of Review by filing a

      (3)   The Board of Review shall schedule a hearing within 60 days after
receiving the request for appeal, unless the taxpayer requests additional time
to prepare or waives a hearing.

before the Board and may be represented by an attorney at law, certified public
accountant or other representative. The board may allow a hearing to be
continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must

      (2)    The commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to sections

until the taxpayer notifies the tax commissioner and the City of its
termination of the election.
         (B)   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (C)   Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the

   (c)    The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer sections

      (2)    Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)    Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out
the duties imposed upon the tax commissioner by those sections.
   (d)    The tax commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as
that term is defined in section 718.01 of the Revised Code and Section

(Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)
181.21 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in sections
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in
a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not consistent,
then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the
Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code,
in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference in
this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and section 181.03 of this chapter, the definition in this section
shall control for all uses of that term in sections
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter.
   As used in sections
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter only:
   (a)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under section
181.23 of this chapter, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net operating
loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal corporation.
   (b)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code, means a
C corporation's federal taxable income before net operating losses and special
deductions as determined under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (b)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (A)    Except as provided in division (b)(4)(B) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (B)    Division (b)(4)(A) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (e)(3)(B) of
section
181.26 of this chapter.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (e)(3)(B) of section
181.26 of this chapter.
   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in Section 718.01(L)(2) of the Revised Code, and is
not a publicly traded partnership that has made the election described in
Section 718.01(D)(5) of the Revised Code, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted
federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
   Nothing in division (b) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (c)   "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section 718.01(L), except that
"taxpayer" does not include natural persons or entities subject to the tax
imposed under Chapter 5745 of the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include
receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when such persons are required
to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (d)   “Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to sections
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter for the purpose of reporting municipal income taxes, and
includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (e)   "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter is changed accordingly but may consist of an aggregation
of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The tax
commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable year
for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal income tax
purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years for federal
income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for a new
taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (f)   "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to section
181.30 of this chapter. (Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)
181.22 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the City and that has made the election under section
181.20 of this chapter.
   (a)    Except as otherwise provided in division (b) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under
181.04 of the this chapter;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the City, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may require, that
the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (A)    Separate accounting;
         (B)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (C)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (D)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (a) of section
181.30 of this chapter.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(a) of section
181.30 of this chapter.
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (A)    The employer;
         (B)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (C)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)(B) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Alternative Net Profits Apportionment for Remote Employees. The
provisions of Section 718.021 of the Ohio Revised Code, entitled is hereby
adopted herein by reference.
      (4)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the City as
follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the City only if, regardless of where title passes, the property
meets either of the following criteria:
         (A)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the City from a
stock of goods located within the City
         (B)    The property is delivered within the City from a location
outside the City, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
City to the extent that such services are performed in the City.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the City.
   (e)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the City in which
the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent or
broker shall be allocated to the City based upon the ratio of the commissions
the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
located in the City to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or
lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (f)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under this chapter or substantially similar provision of the codified
chapters of another municipal corporation, the taxpayer shall add the amount
that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned
to the City. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit
that was apportioned to the City any amount other than the amount upon which
the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock
option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City under this
section.
   (g)    When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

is not available, mail the documents to the tax commissioner. The department of
taxation shall publish a method of electronically submitting the documents
required under this division on or before January 1, 2019.
      (3)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the tax commissioner may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal income tax.
   (c)   (1)   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the
commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (B)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (C)    An extension of time to file under division (c)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with this chapter, the commissioner may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this section, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
   
   (d)    Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the tax commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (e)    When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature. (Ord. 01-
2018. Passed 2-26-18.)
181.25 ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (a)    All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under section
181.20 of this chapter shall file any tax return or extension for filing a tax
return, and shall make payment of amounts shown to be due on such returns,
electronically, either through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner
as prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (b)    A taxpayer may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the
commissioner, to be excused from the requirement to file returns and make
payments electronically. For good cause shown, the commissioner may excuse the
applicant from the requirement and permit the applicant to file the returns or
make the payments by nonelectronic means.
   (c)    The tax commissioner may adopt rules establishing the following:
      (1)    The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns
and make payments by electronic means;
      (2)    The information taxpayers must submit when filing tax returns by
electronic means. (Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)
181.26 CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (a)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (a)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (b)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (b)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (b)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section
181.20 of this chapter, a valid election made by the taxpayer under Section
718.06 of the Revised Code is binding upon the tax commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under section
181.20 of this chapter is terminated, a valid election made under this section
is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period.
   (c)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (d)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in this chapter and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in this chapter.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (b) of section
181.21 of this chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (A)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
181.22 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (B)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section 102 of this Chapter,
include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in
the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (A)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in section
181.22 of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (B)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter on the basis of the entity's net profits that would
otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (f)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section
181.22 of this chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under section
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter or Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code to the corporation,
an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any portion of the
taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated group.
(Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)
181.27 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
181.20 of this chapter fails to pay any tax as required under sections
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter, or any portion of that tax, on or before the date
prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in
the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date prescribed for
its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is issued under
section
181.30 of this chapter, whichever occurs first. (Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)
181.28 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   
   (b)   (1)    Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (c)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (c)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (A)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (B)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (C)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (D)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (A)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (B)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (d)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (e) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (A)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (B)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (C)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (D)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under sections
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter and shall be credited and distributed to municipal
corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (e)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)
181.29 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by sections
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter or Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code, the following
penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under sections
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter fails to make and file the return within the time
prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax commissioner,
the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five dollars per
month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing
between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the date on
which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this
division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
sections
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a penalty
not to exceed the following:
         (A)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (B)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
181.20 of this chapter fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be paid
under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to fifteen per
cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
sections
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter that does not contain information upon which the
substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of sections
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of
one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to be shown on
the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
section
181.31 of this chapter, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of
one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any penalty imposed
under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund
from the date of the refund, may be assessed under section
181.30 of this chapter without regard to any time limitation for the assessment
imposed by division (a) of that section.
   (b)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (c)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (d)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter and shall be credited and distributed to municipal
corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability is required
to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section 718.83 of the
Revised Code.
(Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)
181.30 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (a)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under section
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter fails to file the return within the time prescribed,
files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for
the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an assessment
against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the return or
tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in section
181.31 of this chapter for the same period of time. There shall be no bar or
limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject
to assessment as required by sections
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter, or that files a fraudulent return. The commissioner
shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided
in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the commissioner shall
provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing
on the petition.
   (b)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (c)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (d)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (e)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (c) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (b) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (f)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section
181.31 of this chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by that
section. (Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)
181.31 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (a)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter, including assessments, shall be filed with the tax
commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or
excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period allowed by
division (a) of section
181.30 of this chapter. The application shall be filed in the form prescribed
by the tax commissioner.
   (b)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (c)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (b) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)
181.32 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under section
181.20 of this chapter and used to determine the tax due under sections
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the
internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax
liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner requires. The amended
return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the adjustment is agreed
upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes or after any federal
income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting
therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer
intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to
amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based
on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall
notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (b)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
181.30 of this chapter for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due
under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest. The
amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (c)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section
181.31 of this chapter, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in section
181.30 of this chapter. The application shall not reopen those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments that are not affected, either directly or
indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return.
(Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)
181.33 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (a)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return
made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as required under
those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a duly authorized
agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person subject to this
section is required to furnish the opportunity for the commissioner, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
   (b)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
181.20 to
181.35 of this chapter shall be open to the tax commissioner's inspection
during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six years
following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents relate,
unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction within that
period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The commissioner may
require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep such records as
the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not that person is
liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax levied by a
municipal corporation.
   (c)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (d)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
(Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)

section 718.15 or 718.151 of the Revised Code, shall be available to a taxpayer
that has made the election allowed under section
181.20 of this chapter, against the municipal corporation's tax on income. A

that confirms the eligibility of the taxpayer for the credit, the amount of the
credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the tax year to which the credit
is to be applied.
      (2)    Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the City and taxpayer under section 718.15 or 718.151 of the Revised
Code, or to modify the terms or conditions of any such existing agreement.
(Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-26-18.)

vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under

charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if

         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

303.083 IMPOUNDING VEHICLES ON PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway
patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer without notification to
the chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However,
when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall
allow the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the
removal of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief, or
state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
subsection (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle
by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible
for payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal and storage and
may reclaim the motor vehicle upon payment of those expenses or charges, and
presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a certificate of
title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of
registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon presentation of
proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of the motor vehicle
also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without retrieving the
vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(ORC 4513.61)
303.09 LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle.
(ORC 4513.64)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long

violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation

of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC

313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,

person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any

under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic

relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field

subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the

determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).

commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years. The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. (ORC 4511.19)

         C.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two violations of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or other equivalent offenses is guilty of a misdemeanor. The court

section, it instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both
a jail term and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with
continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to
the thirty-day mandatory jail term. Notwithstanding the jail terms set forth in

felony of the third degree and shall be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
subsection (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may

forfeiture under this section is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or
(3) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other
penalty established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the

that results in the death of another or the unlawful termination of another’s
pregnancy may result in the person being guilty of aggravated vehicular
homicide under Ohio R.C. 2903.06. The court may warn the person of the
applicable penalties for that violation under Ohio R.C. 2903.06 and 2929.142.

violates subsection (b) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle after
underage alcohol consumption and shall be punished as follows:

and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged

of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof. If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of

the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class

4510.02.

section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01.
(ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. (ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONTEMPT OF COURT.
   (a)   Summary Punishment. The Mayor or Vice Mayor of the Mayor’s Court, may
summarily punish a person guilty of misbehavior in the presence of or so near
the court or judge as to obstruct the administration of justice. (ORC 2705.01)
 
   (b)   Acts in Contempt. A person guilty of any of the following acts may be

court held by him or her;
      (5)   Failure of a person recognized to appear as a witness in a court to
appear in compliance with the terms of his or her recognizance.
 
   (c)   Hearing. In case of the occurrence of any of the acts enumerated in
subsection (b) hereof, a charge in writing shall be filed with the Clerk of the
court, an entry thereof made upon the journal and an opportunity given to the
accused to be heard, by himself or herself or counsel. This subsection does not
prevent the court from issuing process to bring the accused into court, or from
holding him or her in custody, pending such proceedings. (ORC 2705.03)
 
   (d)   Right of Accused to Bail. In proceeding under subsection (b) hereof,
if the writ is not returnable forthwith, the court may fix the amount of a bond
to be given by the accused, with surety to the satisfaction of the court. Upon
the return of a writ, when it is not convenient to hear the charge without
delay, the court shall fix the amount of a bond to be given, with surety to the
satisfaction of the Clerk of the court, for the appearance of the accused to
answer the charge.
   On the execution of such bond, the accused shall be released from custody.
(ORC 2705.04)
 
   (e)   Trial. Upon the day fixed for the trial in a contempt proceeding, the

bail under subsection (d) hereof fails to appear in court on the day named, the
court may issued another order of arrest or order the bond for his or her
appearance to be prosecuted, or both. If the bond is prosecuted, the measure of
damages in the action is the extent of the loss or injury sustained by the
aggrieved party by reason of the misconduct for which the contempt was
prosecuted, plus the costs of the proceeding. Such recovery is for the benefit
of the party injured. (ORC 2705.07)
 
   (h)   Judgment Final. The judgment and order of the court or officer thereof
made in cases of contempt may be reviewed on appeal. Appeal proceedings shall
not suspend execution of the order or judgment until the person in contempt

electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous

      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified

   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
      A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
      B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
      C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
      D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
 
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

section. (ORC 2909.11)

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.
(ORC 2909.03)
541.03 CRIMINAL DAMAGING OR ENDANGERING.
   (a)   No person shall cause, or create a substantial risk of physical harm

      (1)   Knowingly, by any means;
      (2)   Recklessly, by means of fire, explosion, flood, poison gas, poison,
radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently

aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part or any other equipment or
implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an aircraft and if
the violation does not create a risk of physical harm to any person, and if the

offenses may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a
single offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose
of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

CHAPTER 733
Solicitors, Peddlers and Canvassers
   EDITOR’S NOTE: Following is an excerpt from the preamble to Ordinance 501-
1959 enacted on April 20, 1959 indicating the intent of Council in restricting
uninvited solicitations:
   “Because of the essentially single family residence character of the City,
divided as it is generally into large lots with greater than average distances
between the residences of the City, and because therefore the practices of
soliciting, peddling and hawking in such a residential neighborhood tend to
bother and annoy the residents of the City, and is quite difficult to
effectively police and control, it is therefore declared that the practice of
going in and upon private residences in the City of Wyoming, Ohio, by
solicitors, peddlers, hawkers, itinerant merchants or transient vendors of
merchandise, not having been requested or invited to do so by the owner or
owners, occupant or occupants of said private residences for the purpose of
soliciting orders for the sale of goods, wares, and merchandise and/or
disposing of and/or peddling or hawking the same be declared to be a nuisance
and punishable as such nuisance as a misdemeanor.”

to the proposed location of a new wireless support structure, provided the
alternate location is within 100' or a distance equal to the width of the Right
of Way in or on which the new wireless support structure is proposed, whichever
is greater. The City of Wyoming also finds that certain locations and
collocation configurations are preferred. A preferred location and collocation
configuration should be utilized whenever possible and should only be surpassed
if in the determination of the Enforcing Official, clear and convincing
evidence supports such a decision. Cost alone should not be grounds for such a
determination. The order of preference is as follows:
            1.   First, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole or wireless support structure within an alley. If no such pole or
wireless support structure is available, then proceed to the next preference;
            2.   Second, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole or wireless support structure within a utility easement to the
rear of the building or property. If no such pole or wireless support structure
is available, then proceed to the next preference;
            3.   Third, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole or wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no
such pole or wireless support structure is available, then proceed to the next
preference;
            4.   Fourth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no such location is
available, then proceed to the next preference;
            5.   Fifth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within an alley. If no such location is available,
then proceed to the next preference;
            6.   Sixth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a
wireless support structure currently supporting a small cell facility located
within the City Right of Way. If no such wireless support structure is
available, then proceed to the next preference;
            7.   Seventh, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole located within the City Right of Way at the rear of the building
or property. If no such existing pole is available, then proceed to the next
preference;
            8.   Eighth, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole located within the City Right of Way. If no such existing pole is
available, then proceed to the next preference;
            9.   Ninth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within a utility easement. If no such
location is available, then proceed to the next preference;
            10.   Tenth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within the City Right of Way.
         B.   Any new wireless support structure shall be located at least 750
feet from any existing small cell facility.

least two small cell facility operators.
            3.   New wireless support structures shall have the following
design elements:
               i.   Material - aluminum poles;
               ii.   Color - black anodized;
               iii.   Diameter -not greater than 12 inches;
               iv.   Style - smooth round tapered profile; should be fluted in
certain areas to better match existing streetscape design;
               v.   Base - trapezoidal pedestal base on a reinforced concrete
footing/foundation pier not to exceed 6 inches above grade if feasible;
               vi.   Exception - If the neighborhood context would be better
served by a pole of a different material, color, style, or base as determined
by the Enforcing Official, then such design elements may be substituted with an
alternate design element. Such determination shall be based on the following
factors:
                  a.   The design features of nearby poles serving in a similar
capacity;
                  b.   The design features of the existing or proposed
streetscape, district, or site;
                  c.   The historical context of a district or specific site;
                  d.   A desire to camouflage or conceal the pole from view.
         B.   Small cell facilities shall be subject to the following design
standards:
            1.   The City reserves the right to require the following:
               i.   Antenna and all associated equipment shall be concealed to

include but shall not be limited to the following:
                  a.   Antenna(s) associated with the first fitting on a
wireless support structure shall be top-mounted and concealed within a radome
that matches the color of the pole on which it is mounted and also conceals the
cable connections, antenna mount and other hardware. The Enforcing Official may
approve a side-mounted antenna with the initial fitting if, or approve an
alternate color, if in the Enforcing Official's discretion, the side-mounted
antenna or alternate color would be more appropriate given the built
environment, neighborhood character, overall site appearance and would promote
the purposes of this Chapter.
                  b.   GPS antennas be placed within the radome or directly
above the radome not to exceed six inches.
            2.   Each Antenna and all associated equipment shall not exceed 6
cubic feet in volume.

               iii.   not extend more than 24 inches away from the pole on
which it is mounted;
               iv.   shall be centered on the vertical axis of the pole to
which it is mounted;
               v.   be mounted at a distance of at least 10 feet measured from
grade to the bottom of the enclosure;
               vi.   be mounted on the side of the pole opposite the side from
which the nearest traffic lane's direction of travel approaches the pole. The
Enforcing Official may approve an alternate mounting orientation, if in the
Enforcing Official's discretion, the alternate mounting orientation would be
more appropriate given the built environment, neighborhood character, overall
site appearance and would promote the purposes of this Chapter.
            5.   Such common enclosures shall have the following design
elements:
               i.   Material-The enclosure material shall be metal, a
composite, or an equivalent
               ii.   material as determined by the Enforcing Official.
               iii.   Color - The enclosure shall match the color of the pole
on which it is mounted unless the surrounding context of the small cell
facility is better suited to another color, as determined by the Enforcing
Official.
               iv.   Style - The enclosure shall match the style, or lack
thereof, of the pole on which it is mounted unless the surrounding context of
the small cell facility is better suited to another style, as determined by the
Enforcing Official.
               v.   Coordinated Design Elements - common enclosures when
located within 3000 feet of an existing common enclosure shall match the design
elements of the existing common enclosure unless the surrounding context of the
small cell facility is better suited to an alternate design.
            6.   All ground mounted equipment shall be placed in an underground
vault. No above grade ground mounted equipment in service of a small cell
facility is permitted unless a waiver is requested and the following conditions
can be satisfied as determined by the Enforcing Official:
               i.   The applicant has submitted clear and convincing evidence
that the equipment cannot feasibly be pole-mounted, placed in an underground
vault, or hidden within or integrated into an existing streetscape element
(i.e. - bus stop shelter). Increased costs alone shall not be a consideration.
If a ground mounted enclosure is approved, the Enforcing Official shall reserve
the right to require any of the following conditions:
               ii.   Concealed Enclosure - All equipment shall be completely
concealed within a metal, composite, or equivalent material enclosure as
determined by the Enforcing Official.

moisture and scoured to expose virgin resin. Joint surfaces shall be heated to
melt temperatures for the period of time specified by the manufacturer. The
joint shall be undisturbed until cool. Fittings shall be manufactured in
accordance with ASTM F 1055.
   (e)   Stab-type Insert Fittings. Joint surfaces shall be clean and free of
moisture. Pipe ends shall be chamfered and inserted into the fitting to full
depth. Fittings shall be manufactured in accordance with ASTM D 2513.
   (f)   Pressure Test. The assembled loop system shall be pressure tested with
water at 100 psi (690 kPa) or 150% of max operating pressure (operating
pressure shall be provided to the city), whichever is greater for thirty (30)
minutes with no leaks observed before connection (header) trenches are
backfilled. Flow rates and pressure drops shall be compared to calculated
values. If actual flow rate or pressure drop figures differ from calculated

1117.01 MASTER PLAN.
   Streets shall conform substantially to the Master Plan adopted by the
Planning Commission and any revisions or amendments thereto. Whenever a tract
to be subdivided includes any part of a street indicated as a thoroughfare on
the Master Plan, such part of such street shall be dedicated by the subdivider.
This required dedication shall also apply to the widening of existing bordering
streets except in cases where the proposed subdivision is limited to a tier of
lots fronting on such bordering street and where the subdivider owns or
controls no adjoining land beyond the rear line of such tier of lots. In no
case shall the required dedication exceed forty feet in width as measured from
the centerline of the bordering street.
(Ord. 12-2012. Passed 10-15-12.)
1117.02 NEIGHBORHOOD PLAN.
   If a tentative plan has been prepared by the Planning Commission for the
neighborhood of the proposed subdivision, the street system of the latter shall
conform in general thereto.
(Ord. 12-2012. Passed 10-15-12.)
1117.03 PHYSICAL FEATURES.
   Streets shall be platted with appropriate regard for topography, creeks,

development.
(Ord. 12-2012. Passed 10-15-12.)
1117.04 EXISTING STREETS.
   Existing streets, constructed or recorded, in adjoining territory shall be
continued at equal or greater width and in similar alignment in the proposed
subdivision, unless variations are recommended by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 12-2012. Passed 10-15-12.)
1117.05 CIRCULATION.
   The street pattern shall provide ease of circulation within the subdivision
as well as convenient access to adjoining streets, thoroughfares or
unsubdivided land, as may be required by the Planning Commission. Minor
residential streets should be so planned as to discourage their use by nonlocal
traffic. Where a street will eventually be extended beyond the plat but is
temporarily dead-ended, an interim turnaround may be required.
(Ord. 12-2012. Passed 10-15-12.)
1117.06 MODIFIED EXPRESSWAYS.
   If a new subdivision involves frontage on a modified expressway, the street
layout should be planned to avoid as far as possible any private residential
driveways from having direct access to such modified expressway. In such cases,
access should be provided by means of a service roadway with motor access at
suitably spaced points.
(Ord. 12-2012. Passed 10-15-12.)
1117.07 UNSUBDIVIDED PORTION OF TRACT.

1117.10 ALLEYS.
   Except where justified by special conditions, alleys will not be approved in
residential districts. At an intersection of alleys, a five-foot chord shall
cut off each corner. Dead-end alleys are prohibited. (Ord. 12-2012. Passed 10-
15-12.)
1117.11 HALF-STREETS.
   The street layout shall be planned to avoid half-streets, if possible. Where
there exists a dedicated or platted half-street adjacent to the tract to be
subdivided, the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary by the Planning
Commission.
(Ord. 12-2012. Passed 10-15-12.)
1117.12 UTILITY STANDARDS AND EASEMENTS.
   Where utilities are located outside of street right-of-way lines, easements
shall be provided. Easements along rear or side lot lines are preferable where
possible. All utilities, including telephone and electric lines, whether inside

pavement width shall be discussed with the public officials having
jurisdiction, to determine whether or not public expenditures, if any, for such
additional width shall be made simultaneously with the developer's improvement.
Cul-de-sac streets shall terminate in a paved turnaround with a minimum outside
radius of twenty-seven and five-tenths feet.
If a "T" or "Y" shaped arrangement is approved by the Planning Commission in
lieu of a turnaround, such paved space shall extend the entire width of the
street right-of-way, and shall be at least twelve and one-half feet wide, with
the flared portions rounded by at least twelve and one-half foot radii.
   (b)    Alleys: twenty feet.
   (c)    Sidewalks: at least four feet wide, and normally one foot from the
property line; crosswalks the same width, in the center of crosswalkways.

1117.18 ALIGNMENT.
   Minimum standards of alignment shall be as follows:
   (a)    Vertical - For thoroughfares and important neighborhood streets
profile grades shall be connected by vertical curves of a minimum length,
measured horizontally, equivalent to fifteen times the algebraic difference
between the rates of grade, expressed in feet per hundred; for minor streets
and alleys, one-half that minimum.
   (b)    Horizontal - Radii of centerline curvature:
      (1)    Thoroughfares: 500 feet.
      (2)    Important neighborhood streets: 200 feet.

   (c)    The minimum radii, noted herein, shall be increased when the smallest
angle of intersection is less than sixty degrees, or in any case where the
Planning Commission considers an increase unnecessary.
      (Ord. 12-2012. Passed 10-15-12..)
1117.20 BLOCKS.
   Blocks shall be as follows:
   (a)    Length - Normal maximum length for blocks: 1800 feet. In a block over
900 feet long a crosswalkway may be required.
   (b)   Width - The width of a block shall normally be sufficient to allow two
tiers of lots of appropriate depth.
   (c)    Irregular Shape - Irregular shaped blocks, including superblocks,
indented by cul-de-sacs, containing interior parks or playgrounds and adequate
parking space, will be acceptable when properly designed and covered by
agreements as to maintenance of such park areas.
   (d)   Orientation on Motorway - If frontage on a motorway is involved, the
long dimension of the block shall preferably front thereon, in order to create
as few intersections as possible with the motorway.
   (e)    Business or Industrial - Blocks intended for business or industry
shall be of such length as may be considered most suitable for their
prospective use, including adequate provision for parking and deliveries.
      (Ord. 12-2012. Passed 10-15-12.)

County Health Commissioner shall designate the proper building setback line.
   (f)    Side Lot Lines - Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right
angles or radial to the street line unless, in the opinion of the Planning
Commission, a variation from this rule will give a better street and lot plan.
(Ord. 500-1959. Passed 4-20-59.)
   (g)    Minimum Street Frontage - The subdivision of any parcel of land, as
provided in these Subdivision Regulations, shall be accomplished in such manner

1117.23 STREET TREES.
   Street trees shall be as follows:
   The subdivider shall plant trees on all streets in new residential
subdivisions that are not located in wooded areas. Before the trees are
planted, the subdivider shall submit a plan of such planting to the Planning
Commission for its study and recommendation, to prevent the planting of certain
species that would become nuisances because of insects or disease or because of
the roots unduly interfering with sewer drains or other underground utilities.
(Ord. 12-2012. Passed 10-15-12.)
1117.24 STREETS.

not provide the information requested in this section, the City Manager shall
reject the application. The City Manager's decision may be supported by such
reports, surveys, expert opinions or other data which is deemed relevant.
   (c)    With the written consent of the owner, the fifteen day review period
may be extended to permit the modification of the proposals in the application.
   (d)    If an application for a Development Plan is determined to be

or change in use to a nonconforming structure or use which otherwise meets the
requirements of Section
1133.06(b)(2)A., B. and C.and has little or no physical or visual impact on the
surrounding neighborhood, a Development Plan Exemption may be granted by the
City Manager when the enlargement, structural alteration or change in use
creates a more restrictive nonconforming structure or use. Alternatively, the
City Manager may refer the application to the Planning Commission for its
recommendation to the City Manager and/or to the Architectural Review Board for
its recommendation to the City Manager. If the City Manager rejects an

   (c)    To protect fully the public health, safety and welfare of the
community, City Council may modify the Development Plan in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. If approved, the Development Plan shall become an
amendment to the Zoning Code and to the Zoning Map provided by the Zoning Code
and shall be governed by the following procedures:
      (1)   The owner shall execute a deed of acceptance of the Development
Plan and the amendment to the Zoning Code, and shall attach the same to the
amendment to the Zoning Code prior to the adoption thereof by City Council.
Such deed of acceptance and amendment to the Zoning Code, when adopted by City
Council, shall be subject to the condition that the construction, structural
alteration or change of use shown thereon shall be substantially completed, to
the satisfaction of the City Manager, within that period of time stated in the
deed of acceptance and the ordinance adopting the Development Plan. In the
event such work has not been substantially completed within that period of time
so stated, such deed of acceptance, Development Plan and amendment to the
Zoning Code shall become null and void, and repealed ab initio.
      (2)    Following adoption of the amendment to the Zoning Code, the City
Manager shall cause such deed of acceptance to be recorded in the land records
applicable to the real estate in the office of the Recorder of Hamilton County.
In the event such amendment subsequently is repealed by operation of law under
subsection (c)(1) hereof, the City Manager shall cause such repeal to be
recorded in the land records applicable to the real estate in the office of the
Recorder of Hamilton County, Ohio.

change the concept or overall design of the project.
   (b)    All changes shall be submitted to the City Manager for approval. In

supplemental Development Plan, prior to referring it to City Council for action
thereon. The time limits and procedures shall be as set forth in Sections

   (c)   The failure of the owner or lessee of the building occupied by such
nonconforming use to obtain a Certificate of Occupancy for the same within one
year of the passage of an ordinance changing the zoning of the property, shall
create a conclusive presumption that such nonconforming use did not exist prior

be designed for purposes of facilitating the logical movement of vehicular
traffic, that no such design shall provide for the parking of vehicles within
the limits of any front yard area, and further that the total surface area of
all pavement associated with the movement of vehicular traffic located in front
of the front building line shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the yard
area encompassed by the front building line, the front property line, and the

1181.01 DEFINITIONS.
   The following terms shall have the following meanings as used in this
chapter:
   (a)   "Application" means the application described in Section
1181.04.
   (b)   "Common areas" is defined as set out in Ohio R.C. 5311.01(B).
   (c)   "Development Plan" means the plan described in Section
1181.05.
   (d)   "Open space" means any land area not occupied by buildings.
   (e)   "Planned Unit Development (PUD)" means a development which is planned
to integrate a variety of residential uses, and in which lot size, setback
lines, yard areas, and unit types may be varied and modified as provided in
this chapter to achieve particular design objectives and make provisions for
open spaces, common areas, utilities and public improvements.
      (Ord. 12-2012. Passed 10-15-12.)
1181.02 PERMITTED USES.
   Any residential use permitted in any district may be permitted in a Planned
Unit Development, whether or not the regulations for the particular tract of
land would permit such use, provided that the project shall be planned,
developed, and operated in accordance with an approved Development Plan, in
order that the specific uses, structures, and developments are properly
integrated with the surrounding area in such a way as to promote the health,
safety, morals, general welfare, and wholesome environment of the general
public and of the occupants of nearby real estate and in order to avoid
nuisances to the general public or to the occupants of nearby real estate.
(Ord. 12-2012. Passed 10-15-12.)
1181.03 INTENSITY OF USE AND NONCONFORMITY.
   The basic area requirements for dwelling units in any district wherein a
Planned Unit Development is located may be abated to the maximum extent of ten
percent (10%). Such area requirements cannot otherwise be abated; however, they
shall not be imposed upon individual dwelling units, but upon the development
as a whole, so that the result of dividing the total gross area of the
development by the approved area per dwelling unit shall yield the permitted
whole number of units for the development, fractional amounts being
disregarded.
   All requirements of the Zoning Code other than the foregoing area
requirements may be waived or modified to any extent consistent with this
chapter, by approval of a Development Plan containing items inconsistent with
such requirements.
   The application of this section to area requirements may be exemplified as
follows:
   (a)   If a ten-acre tract is developed in the AAAA Single-Family Residence
District, which requires lot area of not less than 40,000 square feet per
dwelling unit, the area requirement may be abated to require 36,000 square feet
per dwelling unit, and if abated, twelve dwelling units may be placed in the
development (10 acres = 435,600 square feet. 435,600 square feet divided by
36,000 square feet = 12.1).
   (b)   If a 220,000 square foot tract is developed in the C-1 District, which
requires lot area of not less than 5,000 square feet per dwelling unit, the
area requirements may be abated to require 4,500 square feet per dwelling unit,
and if abated, forty-eight units may be placed in the development (220,000
square feet divided by 4,500 square feet = 48.89).
In the event that the tract to be developed is located in more than one zoning
district, the ten percent (10%) area abatement shall be calculated by dividing
the total gross area of each zoning district contained in the development by
the approved area per dwelling unit to obtain the whole number of units for
that portion of the development, and adding all such numbers together, for
example:
   (c)   A ten-acre tract, comprised of five acres in the AAAA Single-Family
Residence District, which requires lot area of not less than 40,000 square feet
per dwelling unit, and five acres in the AAA Single-Family Residence District,
which requires lot area of not less than 20,000 square feet is proposed for a
Planned Unit Development. The area requirement may be abated to require 36,000
square feet per dwelling unit in the AAAA District, and 18,000 square feet per
dwelling unit in the AAA District. If abated, eighteen dwelling units may be
placed in the entire development (AAAA: 5 acres = 217,800 square feet. 217,800
square feet divided by 36,000 square feet = 6.05. AAA: 5 acres = 217,800 square
feet. 217,800 square feet divided by 18,000 square feet = 12.1. 12.1 + 6.05 =
18.15).
      (Ord. 12-2012. Passed 10-15-12.)
1181.04 PUD APPLICATION.
   An owner or owners, i.e. the developer of a tract of land consisting of an
area of not less than three (3) acres may seek approval of a Planned Unit
Development. Provided however that any such tract of land that is partially or
wholly located within the City of Wyoming Village Historic District, or that

licensing or certification requirements of the City and of the appropriate
State or County certifying agencies.

1193.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDING.
   It is hereby found and determined that there exists within the City premises
that by reason of age, obsolescence, dilapidation, deterioration, lack of
maintenance or repair or a combination thereof constitute a blight and a
nuisance upon the surrounding neighborhood because they are fire hazards,
health hazards, places of retreat for immoral or criminal purposes or for the
breach of the public peace, substantial and unreasonable interferences with the
reasonable and lawful use and enjoyment of other premises in the neighborhood,
or factors seriously depreciating property values in the area.
   It is further found that programs aimed at specific elimination of the
particular blights or nuisances involved in neighborhoods of the City have
sometimes proven inadequate or ineffective, have sometimes failed to prevent
recurrence of the nuisance or blight, and have sometimes resulted merely in the
alteration of the nature or form of the nuisance or blight that previously
existed. It is further found that it therefore becomes necessary in order to
eliminate nuisance and blight and prevent recurrence of blight on the premises
for the City to obtain the title of the blighted premises and to take direct
action to remove the blight or provide for its removal by others and to make
further provisions for future development, redevelopment or use of the premises
in such a way as to prevent any recurrence of blight or nuisance on the
premises.
   It is further found and determined that acquisition of such blighted
property by the City in order to eliminate blight or nuisance and to prevent
its recurrence constitutes a public purpose.
(Ord. 12-2012. Passed 10-15-12.)
1193.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter the words and phrases defined herein shall
have the meanings respectively ascribed to them, unless a different meaning is
clearly indicated by the context.
   (a)    "Blighted premises" means premises which because of their age,
obsolescence, dilapidation, deterioration, lack of maintenance or repair or any
combination thereof constitute a serious fire hazard, a serious health hazard,
a substantial and unreasonable interference with the reasonable and lawful use
and enjoyment of other premises within the neighborhood or a factor seriously
depreciating property values in the neighborhood.
   (b)    "Neighborhood" means an area of the City comprised of all premises or
parcels of land which in whole or in part are located within a radius of 500
feet of any one parcel or lot within the City.
   (c)    "Redevelopment" means the acquisition of blighted premises, the
demolition of a structure or structures thereon, the making of site
improvements, including the construction or reconstruction of structures
thereon, or the sale of property for use in accordance with the Zoning or
Building Code of the City. Redevelopment may include the construction or
improvement by the City of any buildings for public use or for resale to
private persons.
   (d)   "Rehabilitation" means the restoration, rehabilitation or conservation
of blighted premises by improvement, modernization or repair of a structure or
structures thereon to bring it into conformance with applicable building and

      (Ord. 12-2012. Passed 10-15-12.)
1193.03 DETERMINATION OF BLIGHTED PREMISES.
   The City Manager shall present to City Council, from time to time, a report
which shall list therein the location and ownership of premises which he/she
has reason to believe are blighted premises as defined in Section
1193.02(a), and which are located in the City outside of urban renewal areas or
"blighted areas" as defined in Chapter
1191. The report will state briefly the factors which, in the City Manager's
opinion, would warrant the determination that the premises so listed in the
report are blighted.
   The premises so listed in the report shall be only those blighted premises
which, in the opinion of the City Manager, are such that, in order to eliminate
the existing blight and to prevent future blight, acquisition thereof will be
necessary for one or more of the following reasons:
   (a)    The owner of the premises cannot or will not:
      (1)    Eliminate the blighted condition, and/or
      (2)    Prevent recurrence of blight; or
   (b)   The owner has not responded to a lawful order by the City for him to
take action to eliminate its recurrence within thirty days after due notice of
the request or order has been given him by:
      (1)   Posting such order or notice on the premises; or
      (2)    Personal delivery; or
      (3)    Mailing such order or notice to the last known address of the
owner; or
      (4)   Publishing once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper
of general circulation a notice of the issuance of the order relating to the
premises and directing the owner to contact the City Manager in regard to such
order; and
   (c)    Direct action, short of acquisition by the City to eliminate the
blight, including but not limited to clearing the premises of the debris,
demolition of blighted structures, or barricading such structure has proved to
be unsuccessful:
      (1)   To eliminate the blight; or
      (2)    To prevent its recurrence; or
   (d)   In the opinion of the City Manager, based upon conditions existing on
the premises and in the neighborhood, such direct action would be likely to
prove inadequate to eliminate blight or prevent the recurrence.
      (Ord. 12-2012. Passed 10-15-12.)
1193.04 PUBLIC HEARING.
   Upon receipt of a report from the City Manager, City Council shall set a
date for a public hearing in regard to the existence of blight on the premises
and necessity for acquisition by the City in order to eliminate blight and
prevent the recurrence thereof. Such hearing shall be held not less than thirty

received. Upon the fixing of a day for a public hearing, the Clerk of Council

premises and the occupants thereof, if any, or the person in charge of such
premises, if any, notifying them of the time and place of the hearing and
apprising them of their right to appear at such hearing to show cause why the
premises should not be declared to be blighted or why the City should not
acquire such premises for the purpose of eliminating blight thereon and
preventing the recurrence of blight. Notice of such hearing shall be given by:
   (a)    Posting the notice thereof on the premises; or
   (b)    Personal service; or
   (c)    Mailing such order or notice to the last known address of the owner
or person in charge of the premises or to the occupants thereof; or
   (d)    Publishing the notice once a week for three consecutive weeks in a
newspaper of general circulation within the City.

1193.05 PROCEDURE.
   At the hearing required by Section
1193.04, the report of the City Manager shall be read and shall constitute

any person having an interest thereon may proceed to show cause why the
premises should not be declared blighted or the City should not acquire such

At the hearing, the owner, person in charge of the premises or occupant may
cause to be presented to City Council any records of the City pertaining to

   If the owner, person in charge or occupant of the premises does not appear
and presents testimony for the purposes of showing cause why the premises
should not be declared blighted or the City should not acquire the premises for
the purposes of eliminating the blight and preventing recurrence of blight, the
City Manager, or his/her duly appointed representative, shall proceed to

action of the City.

continuances to the City Manager or his/her representative or the owner, person
in charge or occupant of the premises, in order for them to present further
argument or evidence in regard to the existence of blight on the premises or
the need for the City to acquire such premises in order to eliminate blight or

Oak Avenue, Wyoming, Ohio 45215.
(Ord. 13-2012. Passed 10-15-12.)
1333.03 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be
interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give these
regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure. A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal. A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   Base Flood. The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE).  The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development.  Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor.  See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
      Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100 year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.
      Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood depths
of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are
determined.
      Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood depths of 1
to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone A99:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from
the 100 year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
      Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
      Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS).  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   Floodway.  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity floodwaters, high potential for
debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC).  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.
LOMC's are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home.  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFTP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction.  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Wyoming Flood
Insurance Rate Map, March 2, 1979, and includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures.
   (aa)   Person.  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect.  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer. A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor. A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure.  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction;"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 13-2012. Passed 10-15-12.)

structure not meeting the design requirements of Section
1333.19(e) are designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces.
      (3)   Description of any watercourse alteration or relocation that the
flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be diminished, and
maintenance assurances as required in Section
1333.24(c).
      (4)   A hydrologic and hydraulic analysis demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood by more than one foot in special flood hazard areas
where the Federal Emergency Management Agency has provided base flood
elevations but no floodway as required by Section
1333.24(b).
      (5)   A hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis showing impact of
any development on flood heights in an identified floodway as required by

the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Sections
1333.25 to
1333.30.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
      (Ord. 13-2012. Passed 10-15-12.)
1333.15 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including tornado,

Administrator shall:
   (a)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
   (b)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
   (c)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   subsection (a) (2) (a) and (c) through (e).
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a

authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bank full flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bank full flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
       (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Wyoming specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1333.13(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

1333.28 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of Wyoming.
   (b)   Notice for Public Hearing. The appeal shall be placed on the agenda of
the Board of Building and Zoning Appeals in accordance with the established
meeting dates and submission deadlines. Prior to the hearing, a notice of such
hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers of general circulation in
the community at least fifteen (15) days before the date of the hearing and
written notice shall be provided by first class mail at least twenty (20) days
prior to the hearing to the owners of property within and contiguous to and
directly across the street from the parcel of property in question to the last
known address of said property owners. The failure of delivery of notice to the
owners of parcels entitled to notice shall not render action taken by the Board
at the hearing void or voidable.
   (c)   Public Hearing. At such hearing, the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
Sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
       (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations do not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (c) (1) to (11) have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
