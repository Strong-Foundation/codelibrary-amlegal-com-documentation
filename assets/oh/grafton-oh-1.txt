PRELIMINARY UNIT
   EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

established for municipalities by the general law of Ohio.
Section 2. Appropriation Ordinance
   The Clerk-Treasurer shall furnish to the Council an ordinance making
appropriations for the expenditures of the Municipality during the current
year. The Council shall adopt such ordinance in its original form or with such
revisions as it may deem proper within ninety (90) days after the receipt of a
certificate of estimated income for the fiscal year from the County Auditor or
the Budget Commission. The Council may amend or supplement said appropriation
ordinance after its passage. Council may make one or more preliminary
appropriations for current expenses until the annual appropriation ordinance is
in effect.
Section 3. Transfers and Balances
   The Council may transfer any part of an unencumbered balance of an
appropriation of any fund allowed by law to any purpose or object for which the
appropriation for the current year has proved insufficient, except that no
transfer shall be made or moneys raised or appropriated for the payment of any
bond or note of the Municipality unless all indebtedness, interest and other
obligations which must lawfully be paid from such moneys have been paid.
(Amended 11-7-72, 11-8-11)
Section 4. Payment of Claims
   No money shall be drawn from the treasury nor shall an obligation for

   The Council shall, by ordinance, provide for the custody of all funds of the
Municipality and for the deposit of funds in a bank, savings and loan
institution or other qualified financial institution which is under the control
and supervision of the Auditor of State and which affords, in the opinion of
the Council, proper surety for the Municipal funds as well as a proper rate of
interest. All funds received on behalf of the Municipality by any officer,
employee or agent thereof shall be promptly paid over to the Clerk-Treasurer,
and he or she shall cause them to be promptly placed in a depository bank, but
the Council may authorize such sums, as it deems proper, to be in cash for the
daily operation of any department oroffice. The Clerk-Treasurer, with the
concurrence of the majority of the members of Council eligible to vote, shall
invest moneys of the Municipality in bonds or notes of this Municipality, or
any other investment permitted by law, in such manner as is now or hereafter
authorized by general law of the State for such investment by municipalities.
(Amended 5-2-72)
Section 6. Public Bidding
   The Council may authorize expenditures of the Municipality in amounts
exceeding the authorized expenditure limit in the Ohio Revised Code without
public bidding for the acquisition of real estate, for the discharge of
noncontractual claims against the Municipality, for the joint use of facilities
or exercise of powers with other political subdivisions or for the product or
service of public utilities, including those Municipally operated, and in the
event of an emergency or catastrophe for necessary work to eliminate or correct
damages caused by said emergency or catastrophe; but no other expenditures of
more than the authorized expenditure limit in the Ohio Revised Code shall be
made except pursuant to a contract made with the lowest and best bidder after
public advertising and receipt of bids in the manner provided by ordinance.
(Amended 6-2-81)
Section 7. Limitation on Spending
   No Municipal official or employee, whether elected or appointed, shall have
the authority to make an expenditure of Municipal funds or create a liability
in the name of the Municipality for an amount in excess of seventy-five dollars
($75.00) without the prior approval of Council. Any Municipal official or
employee who violates this section shall be held personally liable by the
Municipality for the amount in excess of the above limitation, or the bonding
company for such employee shall be so liable, unless the expenditure is
approved by Council. Similarly, any contract entered into on behalf of the
Municipality by any Municipal official or employee in excess of the above
stated limitation without prior approval shall be null and void unless it is
later approved by the Council. (Amended 11-7-72, 11-3-87, 5-3-94)
Section 8. Public Improvements
   Public improvements of all kinds may be made by the appropriate department,
either by the direct employment of the necessary labor and purchase of supplies
and materials, with a separate account as to each improvement so made, or by
contract let as provided in the preceding section, either for a closed price or
upon a unit basis.
Section 9. Limitation on Rate of Taxation
   The taxing authority of this Municipality shall be in all respects subject
to the limitation therein provided by the Constitution and laws of the State.
Nothing contained in this Charter shall be construed to authorize a levy of any
taxes by this Municipality in excess of said limitations without the vote of
the people.
Section 10. Submission of Extra Levy
   The Council may, at any time at least sixty (60) days prior to a November
election or the date of the special election designated in the resolution
herein provided, declare, by resolution, adopted by a vote of a majority of the
members of Council eligible to vote, that the amount of taxes which may be
raised within the limitations of this Charter will be insufficient to provide
an adequate amount for the necessary requirements of the Municipality for
current operating expenses and other expenses payable from the General Fund of
the Municipality, and such permanent improvements and equipment as shall have
an estimated useful life of five (5) years or more, and that it is necessary to
levy taxes in excess of such limitations, in addition to the levies authorized
and limited by this Charter for the Municipal purpose or purposes specified in
such resolution. Such resolution shall specify the additional sum which it is
necessary to levy, the purpose or purposes thereof, the additional rate
estimated to be required therefor and the date of any proposed election
thereon. Such resolution shall be effective upon its adoption and shall be
certified, within five (5) days thereafter, to the election authorities, who
shall place such question upon the ballot at the next succeeding November
election or at such special election specified in the resolution. If a majority
of those voting thereon vote for the approval of such additional levy, the
Council shall immediately make such levy, or such part thereof as it finds
necessary, pursuant to such approval, and certify the same to the County
Auditor, to be placed on the tax list and collected as other taxes.
   The authority of the Council to submit additional levies to a vote of the
people, or to levy taxes upon such other subjects and for such other purposes
as may be lawful under the Constitution or laws of this State, shall not be
deemed impaired or abridged by reason of any provision contained in this
Charter.
Section 11. Debt Limitation
   The Municipality shall not incur debt in excess of the limitations imposed
by the Constitution and laws of the State of Ohio.
(Amended 11-6-18)
Section 12. Conflict of Interest
   To the extent provided by general law, no elected official, member of a
board or commission or employee of the Village shall, directly or indirectly,
be interested in the profits or emoluments of any contract, work or service
with or for the Village. Council shall, by ordinance, establish rules and
regulations regarding the prohibition of conflict of interest. This section
shall be in effect by January 1, 1973.
(Amended 11-7-72)
ARTICLE IX
NOMINATIONS AND ELECTIONS
   Nominations for elective offices of the Municipality shall be made only by
petition. Candidates shall file a petition signed by twenty-five (25)
registered electors. Each petition shall be accompanied by the written
acceptance of the nominee. The nomination of each candidate shall be made by a
petition, but such petition may be circulated in separate parts, which parts
shall be filed as one instrument. No primary election shall be held for the
selection of any candidate for any elective office of this Municipality, and no
nomination for any such office shall be of any effect unless made as required
by this section. The ballot used in the election of officers of the
Municipality shall be without party marks or designation. The names of all
candidates for any Municipal office shall be placed upon the same ballot and
shall be rotated in the manner provided by the laws of Ohio.
   If a citizen who has filed his or her nomination petition properly for any
of the elective offices shall become disqualified from holding office or die
between the last day for filing nomination petitions and the day of the
election, then the County Board of Elections shall make provision on the day of
election to fill the office for which he or she was a candidate so that the
electors may vote for a write-in candidate for the office for which he or she
was a candidate.
   Write-in votes shall not be permitted except for those elective offices for
which no person has filed a nominating petition to run as a candidate.
   Except as otherwise provided in this Charter, the general laws of Ohio shall
govern the nomination and election of elective officers of the Municipality.
(Amended 11-7-78, 11-8-11)
ARTICLE X
INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM, RECALL
Section 1. Initiative
   The electors shall have the power to propose any ordinance or resolution,
except an ordinance appropriating money or authorizing the levy of taxes, and
to adopt or reject the same at the polls, such power being known as the
initiative. An initiated ordinance or resolution shall be submitted to Council
by a petition signed by at least ten percent (10%) of the electors voting at
the last regular Municipal election, provided, however, that an initiated
ordinance or resolution proposing to amend, enlarge or change the zoning of any
real property shall be submitted by a petition signed by at least thirty
percent (30%) of the electors residing within the ward or wards in which the
real property is located or in which abutting real property is located. When so
submitted, the Clerk-Treasurer shall determine the sufficiency and, if
sufficient, the Council shall take final action, either enacting, amending or
rejecting the proposed ordinance, within forty (40) days after submission. If
Council fails to pass such proposed ordinance or resolution, or passes it in
some form different from that set forth in the petition therefor, the
petitioners, through the committee named on such petition, may, by the next
regular meeting of Council, request, in writing, that it be submitted to a vote
of the electors. Thereupon, Council shall provide for submitting the petitioned
ordinance or resolution to the electors at the next general or regular
Municipal election occurring more than ninety (90) days after the filing of
such petition; but if such petition is signed by at least fifty-one percent
(51%) of such electors, the date of the election may be fixed therein, which
may be a special election to be held at any time more than ninety (90) days
after the filing of such petition.
(Amended 5-3-94)
Section 2. Referendum
   Within thirty (30) days after the enactment by Council of any ordinance or
resolution which is subject to a referendum under the laws of the State, a
petition, signed by not less than ten percent (10%) of the total electors
voting at the regular Municipal election, may be filed with the Council,
requesting the ordinance or resolution be repealed or submitted to a vote of
the electors. When said petition is filed, the Clerk-Treasurer shall first
ascertain the sufficiency of the petition and, if found sufficient, the Council
shall thereupon, within thirty (30) days of the filing of such petition,
reconsider such ordinance or resolution. If Council fails to repeal said
ordinance or resolution within thirty (30) days, the Council shall submit it to
a vote of the electors at the next general or regular Municipal election
occurring more than ninety (90) days after the filing of such petition; but if
such petition is signed by at least fifty-one percent (51%) of such electors,
the date of the election may be fixed therein, which may be a special election
to be held at any time more than ninety (90) days after the filing of such
petition.
   Ordinances providing for the annual tax levy or for improvements petitioned
for by the owners of a majority of the front footage of the property benefited
and to be specially assessed therefor, and appropriation ordinances limited to
the subject of appropriations, shall not be subject to referendum; but all
other ordinances, including emergency ordinances, shall be subject to
referendum, except that emergency ordinances shall go into effect at the time
indicated therein. If, when submitted to a vote of the electors, an emergency
measure is not approved by a majority of those voting thereon, it shall be
considered repealed as regards any further action thereunder; but such measure
shall be deemed sufficient authority for payment, in accordance with the
ordinance, of any expense incurred previous to the referendum vote thereon.
Section 3. Recall
   Electors shall have the power to remove from office, by recall election, any
elected official of the Municipality. After an elected official has served six
(6) months of his or her term, a petition demanding his or her recall and
removal may be filed with the Clerk-Treasurer. Such petition shall be signed by
at least forty percent (40%) of the total number of electors voting at the last
preceding regular Municipal election.
   Within ten (10) days from the date of filing such petition, the Clerk-
Treasurer shall determine the sufficiency thereof. If the Clerk-Treasurer finds
the petition insufficient, he or she shall promptly certify the particulars in
which the petition is defective and deliver a copy of his or her certificate to
the person who filed the petition with him or her. Such person shall be allowed
twenty (20) days from the delivery of such copy of certificate in which to make
the petition sufficient. If the Clerk-Treasurer finds the petition sufficient,
he or she shall promptly so certify to the Council and to the officer whose
removal is sought; and if the officer does not resign within five (5) days
thereafter, the Council shall thereupon order and fix a day for holding a
recall election, not less than thirty (30) nor more than forty (40) days from
the date of the Clerk-Treasurer's certificate of sufficiency. If a majority of
the votes cast shall be voted affirmatively, such officer shall remain in
office. If a majority of the votes cast shall be voted negatively, such officer
shall be considered as removed, his or her office shall be deemed vacant and
such vacancy shall be filled as provided in this Charter. The officer removed
by such recall election shall not be eligible for appointment to the vacancy
created thereby. (Amended 11-8-11)
Section 4. Petitions
   An initiative, referendum or recall petition may be circulated in separate
parts, but the separate parts shall be bound together and filed as one
instrument. Each part shall contain, in the case of the initiative or
referendum, a full and correct copy of the title and text of the proposed or
referred ordinance or resolution, and in the case of the recall, the name and
office of the person whose removal is sought and a statement in not more than
two hundred (200) words of the grounds for the removal.
   In the case of recall petitions, the statement of the words for the grounds
for the removal shall state such grounds with specificity and the petition
shall not be deemed sufficient unless the statement of grounds contains
specific allegations of malfeasance, misfeasance, theft in office, misuse of
public funds and/or similar or other misconduct recognized under the laws of
the State of Ohio. Initiative, referendum and recall petitions in all other
matters of sufficiency, form and regularity not specifically addressed herein
shall conform to the laws of the State of Ohio and shall be subject to the
penalties provided by Ohio law for violations of said provisions. (Amended 11-
6-90)
ARTICLE XI
FRANCHISES
   The Council may, by ordinance, grant permission to any person, firm or
corporation to construct and operate a public utility on, across, under or
above any public street or ground within this Municipality. It may prescribe in
the ordinance the kind and quality of service or product to be furnished, the
rate or rates to be charged therefor and any other terms conducive to the
public interest. Such grant may be amended or renewed in the manner and subject
to the provisions established by this Charter for original grants. Such grant,
amendment or renewal shall be for such period of time, not exceeding twenty-
five (25) years, as the Council may determine, and shall not be exclusive.
   No consent of the owner of property abutting on any public street or ground
shall be necessary to the effectiveness of any such grant, amendment or
renewal, unless the construction or operation of the public utility authorized
thereby is of such character as to constitute an additional burden upon such
public street or ground. All such grants, amendments or renewals shall be made
subject to the continuing rights of the Council to provide reasonable
regulations for the operation of such utilities with reference to such streets
and public grounds, including the right to require such reconstruction,
relocation or discontinuance of appliances, plant or equipment used in such
streets or public grounds as shall, in the opinion of the Council, be necessary
in the public interest.
   No ordinance making, amending or renewing such grant shall be passed by the
Council until it shall have been read at three (3) regular meetings of the
Council.
ARTICLE XII

on January 1, 1968.

invalidate or impair the force or effect of any other part hereof, except as
such other part is wholly dependent for its operation upon the part declared
invalid.

   The adoption of this Charter shall not affect any pre-existing rights of the
Municipality; any right, liability or pending suit or prosecution either on
behalf of or against the Municipality or any officer thereof; any franchise
granted by the Municipality; or any pending proceedings for the authorization
of public improvements or the levy of assessments therefor. Except as a
contrary intent appears herein, all acts of the Council of the Municipality
shall continue in effect until lawfully amended or repealed.
Section 4. Interpretation of the Charter
   The article and section headings herein have been inserted for convenient

affect any provision of this Charter.

appointee, employee or nonelected official, commission, board or department of

the expenditure of any money on the part of the Municipality other than in his
or her fixed compensation and expenses. Any contract with the Municipality in
which any officer or employee is or becomes financially interested may be
declared void by the Council. Such interest shall disqualify any such officer
or employee from holding office in addition to the other penalties provided by
law.
Section 8. Investigations
   The Council, any committee thereof or any board appointed by the Council for
such purpose shall have the power at any time to consider the affairs of any
department or the conduct of any officer or employee to be investigated; and

the production of books, papers and other evidence; and for that purpose may
issue subpoenas or attachments which shall be signed by the President of
Council or chairperson of the committee or board making the investigation and
shall be served by any officer authorized by law to serve such process. The

electors to the extent that such submission is not governed by this Charter or
the Constitution of the State.
   If any such proposed amendment or amendments shall be approved by a majority
of the electors voting thereon, it or they shall become a part of this Charter,

matter shall be submitted at the same election, only the one such amendment
receiving the largest majority of affirmative votes cast shall become a part of
this Charter.

CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time from
2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in
October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   There are no sections in Chapter 204. This chapter has been established to
provide a place for cross references and any future legislation.

CHAPTER 214
Public Records Policy
214.01   Introduction and definition.
214.02   Records requests.
214.03   Costs for public records.
214.04   E-mail.
214.05   Failure to respond to public records request.
214.01   INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITION.
   (a)   It is the policy of the Village of Grafton that openness leads to a
better informed citizenry, which leads to better government and better public
policy. It is the policy of the Village of Grafton to strictly adhere to the
state's Public Records Act. All exemptions to openness are to be construed in
their narrowest sense and any denial of public records in response to a valid
request must be accompanied by an explanation, including legal authority, as
outlined in the Ohio Revised Code. If the request is in writing, the
explanation must also be in writing.
   (b)   The Village of Grafton, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code,
defines records as including the following: Any document - paper, electronic
(including, but not limited to, e-mail), or other format - that is created or
received by, or comes under the jurisdiction of a public office that documents
the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or
other activities of the office. All records of the Village of Grafton are
public unless they are specifically exempt from disclosure under the Ohio
Revised Code.
   (c)   It is the policy of the Village of Grafton that, as required by Ohio
law, records will be organized and maintained so that they are readily
available for inspection and copying. Record retention schedules are to be
updated regularly and posted prominently.
(Ord. 07-021. Passed 11-6-07.)
214.02   RECORDS REQUESTS.
   Each request for public records should be evaluated for a response using the
following guidelines:
   (a)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian must contact
the requester for clarification, and should assist the requestor in revising
the request by informing the requestor of the manner in which the office keeps
its records.
   (b)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing, and
does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record. It is this office's general policy that this
information not be requested.
   (c)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours, with the exception of published holidays. Public records must
be made available for inspection promptly. Copies of public records must be
made available within a reasonable period of time. "Prompt" and "reasonable"
take into account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the
location where the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review
of the records requested.
   (d)   (1)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), budgets, salary
information, forms and applications, personnel rosters, etc. If fewer than 20
pages of copies are requested or if the records are readily available in an
electronic format that can be e-mailed or downloaded easily, these should be
made as quickly as the equipment allows.
      (2)   All requests for public records must normally either be satisfied
or be acknowledged in writing by the (public office) within three business days
following the office's receipt of the request. If a request is deemed
significantly beyond "routine," such as seeking a voluminous number of copies
or requiring extensive research, the acknowledgment must normally include the
following:
         A.   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request.
         B.   An estimated cost if copies are requested.
         C.   Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure.
   (e)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority. If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released. If there
are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation,
including legal authority.
(Ord. 07-021. Passed 11-6-07.)
214.03   COSTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual cost of making
copies.
   (a)   The charge for paper copies is $0.05 per page.
   (b)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is $1 per
disc.
   (c)   There is no charge for documents e-mailed.
   (d)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. They will be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies.
(Ord. 07-021. Passed 11-6-07.)
214.04   E-MAIL.
   Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by the Ohio
Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the office. E-mail
is to be treated in the same fashion as records in other formats and should
follow the same retention schedules.
   (a)   Records in private e-mail accounts used to conduct public business are
subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of this office are
instructed to retain their e-mails that relate to public business and to copy
them to their business e-mail accounts and/or to the office's records
custodian.
   (b)   The records custodian is to treat the e-mails from private accounts as
records of the public office, filing them in the appropriate way, retaining
them per established schedules and making them available for inspection and
copying in accordance with the Public Records Act.
(Ord. 07-021. Passed 11-6-07.)
214.05   FAILURE TO RESPOND TO PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST.
   The Village of Grafton recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of
failure to properly respond to a public records request. In addition to the
distrust in government that failure to comply may cause, failure to comply with
a request may result in a court ordering the Village to comply with the law and
to pay the requester attorney's fees and damages.
(Ord. 07-021. Passed 11-6-07.)
CHAPTER 216

216.05   Red flag identification.
216.06   Responding to red flags.

216.08   Program administration.
216.01   INTRODUCTION.
   The risk to the Village, its employees and customers from data loss and
identity theft is a significant concern to the Village and can be reduced only
through the combined efforts of every employee and contractor. Therefore, the
Village adopts this sensitive information policy to help protect employees,
customers, contractors and the Village from damages related to the loss or
misuse of sensitive information. This policy and protection program applies to
employees, contractors, consultants, temporary workers, and other workers at
the Village, including all personnel affiliated with third parties.
(Ord. 09-003. Passed 2-17-09.)
216.02   STATEMENT OF POLICY.
   (a)   Definition of Sensitive Information. Sensitive information includes
the following items whether stored in electronic or printed format:
      (1)   Credit card information, including any of the following:

         B.   Credit card expiration date;
         C.   Cardholder name; and/or
         D.   Cardholder address.
      (2)   Tax identification numbers, including:
         A.   Social Security number;

         D.   Maiden name;
         E.   Names; and/or
         F.   Customer number.
   (b)   Municipal personnel are encouraged to use common sense judgment in
securing confidential information to the proper extent. Furthermore, this
section should be read in conjunction with Ohio's Public Records Act and the
Village's open records policy. If an employee is uncertain of the sensitivity
of a particular piece of information, he or she should contact their
supervisor. In the event that the Village cannot resolve a conflict between
this policy and the Ohio Public Records Act the Village will contact the Law
Director.
(Ord. 09-003. Passed 2-17-09.)
216.03   HARD COPY DISTRIBUTION.
   Each employee and contractor performing work for the Village will comply
with the following policies:
   (a)   File cabinets, desk drawers, overhead cabinets, and any other storage
space containing documents with sensitive information will be locked when not
in use.
   (b)   Storage rooms containing documents with sensitive information and
record retention areas will be locked at the end of each workday or when
unsupervised.
   (c)   Desks, workstations, work areas, printers and fax machines, and common
shared work areas will be cleared of all documents containing sensitive
information when not in use.
   (d)   Whiteboards, dry-erase boards, writing tablets, etc. in common shared
work areas will be erased, removed, or shredded when not in use.
   (e)   When documents containing sensitive information are discarded they
will be placed inside a locked shred bin or immediately shredded using a
mechanical cross cut shredding device. Locked shred bins are labeled
"Confidential paper shredding and recycling." (Municipal records, however, may
only be destroyed in accordance with the Village's records retention policy).
(Ord. 09-003. Passed 2-17-09.)
216.04   ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION.
   Each employee and contractor performing work for the Village will comply
with the following policies:
   (a)   Each employee with access to sensitive information will be assigned a
password, the security of which is to be maintained by the employee.
   (b)   Internally, sensitive information may be transmitted using approved
municipal e-mail.
   (c)   Any sensitive information sent externally must be password protected
and only to approved recipients. Additionally, a statement such as this should
be included in the e-mail:
   “This message may contain confidential and/or proprietary information and is
intended for the person/entity to whom it was originally addressed. Any use by
others is strictly prohibited.”
(Ord. 09-003. Passed 2-17-09.)
216.05   RED FLAG IDENTIFICATION.
   (a)   Covered Accounts. A covered account includes any account that involves
or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions. Every new and
existing customer account that meets the following criteria is covered by this
program:
      (1)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft; or
      (2)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk to the safety or soundness of the Village from
identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation, or
litigation risks.
   (b)   Red Flags. The following red flags are potential indicators of fraud.
Any time a red flag, or a situation closely resembling a red flag, is apparent,
it should be investigated for verification.
      (1)   Alerts, notifications or warnings from a consumer reporting agency;
      (2)   A fraud or active duty alert included with a consumer report;
      (3)   A notice of credit freeze from a consumer reporting agency in
response to a request for a consumer report; or
      (4)   A notice of address discrepancy from a consumer reporting agency as
defined in § 334.82(b) of the Fairness and Accuracy in Credit Transactions Act.
      (5)   Red flags also include consumer reports that indicate a pattern of
activity inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an
applicant or customer, such as:
         A.   A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
         B.   An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;
         C.   A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect
to recently established credit relationships; or
         D.   An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of
account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
   (c)   Suspicious Documents. The following may also be potential indicators
of fraud:
      (1)   Documents provided for identification that appear to have been
altered or forged;
      (2)   The photograph or physical description on the identification is not
consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
identification;
      (3)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification;
      (4)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the Village, such as a
signature card or a recent check; or
      (5)   An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the
appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
   (d)   Suspicious Personal Identifying Information. The following may also be
potential indicators of fraud:
      (1)   Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the Village. For example:
         A.   The address does not match any address in the consumer report; or
         B.   The Social Security number (SSN) has not been issued or is listed
on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File.
      (2)   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not
consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and
date of birth.
      (3)   Personal identifying information provided is associated with known
fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the
Village. For example, the address on an application is the same as the address
provided on a fraudulent application.
      (4)   Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly
associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party
sources used by the Village. For example:
         A.   The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a
prison;
         B.   The phone number is invalid or is associated with a pager or
answering service;
         C.   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons
opening an account or other customers; or
         D.   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or
similar to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large
number of other customers or other persons opening accounts.
      (5)   The customer or the person opening the covered account fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete.
      (6)   Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal identifying information that is on file with the Village.
      (7)   When using security questions (mother's maiden name, pet's name,
etc.), the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide
authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from
a wallet or consumer report.
   (e)   Unusual Use of or Suspicious Activity Related to the Covered Account.
The following may also be potential indicators of fraud:
      (1)   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered
account, the Village receives a request for new, additional, or replacement
goods or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the account.
      (2)   A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly
associated with known patterns of fraud patterns. For example, the customer
fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent
payments.
      (3)   A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with
established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:
Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments; a material
change in purchasing or usage patterns.
      (4)   A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy
period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the
expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).
      (5)   Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable
although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the
customer's covered account.
      (6)   The Village is notified that the customer is not receiving paper
account statements.
      (7)   The Village is notified of unauthorized charges or transactions in
connection with a customer's covered account.
      (8)   The Village receives notice from customers, victims of identity
theft, law enforcement authorities, or other persons regarding possible
identity theft in connection with covered accounts held by the Village.
      (9)   The Village is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft,
a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a
fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.
(Ord. 09-003. Passed 2-17-09.)
216.06   RESPONDING TO RED FLAGS.
   (a)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, an employee must act
quickly as a rapid appropriate response can protect customers and the Village
from damages and loss.
   (b)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, gather all related
documentation and write a description of the situation. Present this
information to the designated authority for determination.
   (c)   The designated authority will complete additional authentication to
determine whether the attempted transaction was fraudulent or authentic.
   (d)   If a transaction is determined to be fraudulent, appropriate actions
must be taken immediately. Actions may include:
      (1)   Canceling the transaction;
      (2)   Notifying and cooperating with appropriate law enforcement;
      (3)   Determining the extent of liability of the Village; and
      (4)   Notifying the actual customer that fraud has been attempted.
(Ord. 09-003. Passed 2-17-09.)
216.07   PERIODIC UPDATES TO PROGRAM.
   (a)   At periodic intervals established in the program, or as required, the
program will be re-evaluated to determine whether all aspects of the program
are up to date and applicable in the current business environment.
   (b)   Periodic reviews will include an assessment of which accounts are
covered by the program.
   (c)   As part of the review, red flags may be revised, replaced or
eliminated. Defining new red flags may also be appropriate.
   (d)   Actions to take in the event that fraudulent activity is discovered
may also require revision to reduce damage to the Village and its customers.
(Ord. 09-003. Passed 2-17-09.)
216.08   PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   The Identity Theft Prevention Program shall not be operated as an
extension to existing fraud prevention programs, and its importance warrants
the highest level of attention. The Identity Theft Prevention Program is the
responsibility of the governing body.
   (b)   Operational responsibility of the program is delegated to the Clerk-
Treasurer.
   (c)   Staff training shall be conducted for all employees, officials and
contractors for whom it is reasonably foreseeable that they may come into
contact with accounts or personally identifiable information that may
constitute a risk to the Village or its customers. The Clerk-Treasurer is
responsible for ensuring identity theft training for all requisite employees
and contractors.
   (d)   Employees must receive annual training in all elements of this policy.
   (e)   It is the responsibility of the Village to ensure that the activities
of all service providers are conducted in accordance with reasonable policies
and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity
theft. A service provider that maintains its own identity theft prevention
program, consistent with the guidance of the red flag rules and validated by
appropriate due diligence, may be considered to be meeting these requirements.
Any specific requirements should be specifically addressed in the appropriate
contract arrangements.

(Res. 96-024. Passed 8-20-96.)
234.07   INVESTMENT POLICY.
   (a)   Purpose. It is the policy of the Village to invest public funds in a
manner which will provide the highest investment return with the maximum
security, safety and preservation of principal while meeting the daily cash
flow demands of the Village and conforming to all applicable statutes governing
the investment of public funds by an Ohio municipality. The Clerk-Treasurer is
the investment officer for the Village, charged with the responsibility for the
purchase and sale of investments and the carrying out of this investment
policy.
   (b)   Scope. This investment policy applies to all financial assets of the
Village, including State and Federal funds held by it. The Clerk-Treasurer
shall routinely monitor the contents of the Village's investment portfolio, the
available markets and relative value of competing investments and will adjust
the portfolio accordingly.
   (c)   Prudence.
      (1)   Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under
circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for
speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their
capital as well as the probable income to be derived.
      (2)   The standard of prudence to be used by the Clerk-Treasurer shall be
the "prudent person" standard and shall be applied in the context of managing
the overall portfolio. Acting in accordance with this investment policy and
exercising due diligence shall relieve the Clerk-Treasurer of personal
responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price
changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported to the Council in a
timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
   (d)   Objectives. The primary objectives, in priority order, of the
Village's investment activities shall be:
      (1)   Safety. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the
investment program. Investments of the Village shall be undertaken in a manner
that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To
attain this objective, diversification is required in order that potential
losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the
remainder of the portfolio.
      (2)   Liquidity. The Village's investment portfolio will remain
sufficiently liquid to enable it to meet all operating requirements which might
be reasonably anticipated.
      (3)   Return on investment. The Village's investment portfolio shall be
designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account this investment policy and
the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio.
   (e)   Ethics and Conflict of Interest. Persons involved in the investment
process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with
proper execution of the investment program, or which could impair their ability
to make impartial investment decisions. Employees and investment consultants
shall disclose to the Village any material financial interests in financial
institutions that conduct business within the Village and any large personal
financial or investment positions that could be related to, or affected by, the
performance of the Village's portfolio. All employees, officers and investment
consultants to the Village shall subordinate their personal investment
transactions to those of the Village, particularly with regard to the timing of
purchases and sales.
   (f)   Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions.
      (1)   The Clerk-Treasurer will maintain a list of financial institutions
and approved security broker/dealers selected by credit worthiness who are
authorized to provide investment services and which qualify under Ohio R.C.
135.14(M)(1). These may include "primary" dealers or regional dealers that
qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 and are registered
with the Ohio Department of Commerce to do business in the State.
      (2)   All financial institutions and broker/dealers which desire to
become qualified suppliers of investment transactions to the Village must
provide the Clerk-Treasurer with audited annual financial statements, proof of
good standing with the Comptroller of Currency or State banking regulators or
National Association of Securities Dealers certification, proof of Ohio
registration and biographical and regulatory information on the persons who are
the primary contact with the entity. All financial institutions, broker/dealers
and consultants which desire to conduct investment business with the Village
must sign this investment policy, certifying they have read it, understand it
and agree to abide by its contents.
   (g)   Authorized Investments. The Village is empowered by statute to invest
in the following types of securities:
      (1)   United States Treasury bills, notes, bonds or any other obligation
or security guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States.
      (2)   Bonds, notes, debentures, or other obligations or securities issued
by any federal government agency or instrumentality, including but not limited
to the Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal
Farm Credit Bank, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Government National
Mortgage Association and Student Loan Marketing Association. All such
securities shall be direct issuances of federal government agencies or
instrumentalities;
      (3)   Interim deposits in duly authorized depositories of the Village,
provided those deposits are properly insured or collateralized as required by
law;
      (4)   Bonds and other obligations of the State of Ohio;
      (5)   No-load money market mutual funds consisting exclusively of
securities described in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) hereof and repurchase
agreements secured by such obligations, provided all such investments under
this paragraph (5) shall be made with a bank or savings and loan association
eligible to be a depository for public funds of Ohio subdivisions and provided
further that any such fund meets the requirements of Ohio R.C. Chapter 135,
including that such fund not include any investment in a "derivative";
      (6)   Ohio Subdivision's Fund (STAROhio); and
      (7)   Overnight or term (not exceeding thirty days) repurchase agreements
meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 135.14(E), with a bank or savings and
loan association eligible to be a depository for public funds of Ohio
subdivisions or a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers.
issued by the United States Treasury or any other obligation.
   (h)   Diversification. The Village will diversify its investments by
security, type and institution. With the exception of direct obligations of the
U.S. Treasury and STAROhio, no more than seventy-five percent of the Village's
total investment portfolio will be invested in a single security type or with a
single financial institution.
   (i)   Maximum Securities.
      (1)   To the extent possible, the Village will attempt to match its
investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. No investments shall be
made unless the Clerk-Treasurer, at the time of making the investment,
reasonably expects it can be held to its maturity. Unless matched to a specific
obligation or debt of the Village, the Village will not directly invest in
securities listed as paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) hereof maturing more than
five years from the date of settlement if such securities bear interest at a
fixed rate, and it will not directly invest in such securities maturing more
than two years from the date of settlement if they bear interest at a variable
rate.
      (2)   Within certain limits the maximum maturity period of the securities
in which the Village can invest is up to the Village. The maximum maturity
period of such securities bearing interest at a fixed rate must, however, be no
greater than five years. In addition, an eligible investment bearing interest
at a variable rate, in order not to be deemed a "derivative" as defined in Ohio
R.C. Chapter 135, must have such variable interest rate payment based upon a
single interest payment or single index comprised of other investments as
described in paragraphs (g)(1) or (2) hereof, and must have a maximum maturity
period no greater than two years.
   (j)   Safekeeping and Custody. All security transactions, including
securities acquired subject to repurchase agreements, entered into by the
Village shall be conducted on a delivery-versus-payment basis. Purchased
securities will be held by a third party custodian, designated by the Clerk-
Treasurer, that is a Federal Reserve Bank or other "qualified trustee" within
the meaning of Ohio R.C. 135.18(I), and the safekeeping of those securities for
the benefit of the Village shall be evidenced by safekeeping receipts.
Purchased securities shall be released by the Village only upon verification
that the principal and interest, or proceeds of sale of the securities, have
been credited to the Village's account.
   (k)   Prohibited Investment Practices. In addition to any other prohibitions
in the Revised Code, the Village shall not:
      (1)   Contract to sell securities that have not yet been acquired on the
speculation that prices will decline;
      (2)   Make any investment in "derivatives" as defined in Ohio R.C. 135.14
(C);
      (3)   Invest in a fund established by another public body for the purpose
of investing public money of other subdivisions unless the fund is either:
STAROhio or a fund created solely from the purpose of acquiring, constructing,
owning, leasing or operating municipal utilities as authorized under Ohio R.C.
715.02 or Section 4 of Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution;
      (4)   Enter into reverse repurchase agreements;
      (5)   Leverage current investments as collateral to purchase other
assets; and
      (6)   Invest in stripped principal or interest obligations of otherwise
eligible obligations.
   (l)   Internal Controls. The Clerk-Treasurer shall develop and maintain
procedures for the operation of the Village's investment program in accordance
with this investment policy. These procedures shall be designed to prevent loss
of the Village's funds due to fraud, error, misrepresentation, unanticipated
market changes or imprudent actions.
   (m)   Reporting.
      (1)   The Clerk-Treasurer shall maintain a current inventory of all
investments including:
         A.   Description of each security;
         B.   Cost;
         C.   Par value;
         D.   Dates (beginning, settlement and maturity);
         E.   Rates; and
         F.   Seller.
      (2)   The Clerk-Treasurer shall also prepare and distribute quarterly (or
more frequently if requested by the Council) a list of all investments and a
report on investment activity and returns.
   (n)   Education. The Clerk-Treasurer shall participate in any beginning and/
or continuing education training programs sponsored by the State Treasurer or
the State Auditor in which the Clerk-Treasurer is required to participate
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 117.44, 135.22 and 733.27. Through participation in those
programs, the Clerk-Treasurer will develop and maintain an enhanced background
and working knowledge in investment, case management, and ethics.
   (o)   Non-Binding Arbitration. The Clerk-Treasurer may enter into a written
investment or deposit agreement that includes a provision under which the
parties agree to submit to non-binding arbitration (but not binding
arbitration) to settle any controversy that may arise out of that agreement so
long as such provision meets the requirements of the Ohio Revised Code and is
specifically approved by the Council.
   (p)   Investment Policy Adoption. This investment policy shall be adopted by
the Council and, upon adoption, filed in the office of the Auditor of State.
The policy shall be reviewed on an annual basis by the Council or a committee
designated by it and any modifications made thereto must be approved by the
Council and, upon adoption, filed in the office of the Auditor of State.

least twelve months (this includes all time worked whether consecutive or not)
and who has worked at least 1,250 hours in the previous twelve-month period, is
entitled to family and medical leave (“FMLA Leave”), without pay, for any of
the following: (Whether an employee has worked the minimum 1,250 hours of
service is determined according to FLSA principles for determining compensable
hours of work. The 1,250 hours include only those hours actually worked. Paid
time off and unpaid time off, including FMLA leave, are not included.)
         A.   Military Caregiver Leave. An eligible employee who is a spouse,
son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of a covered service member with a

out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, son. daughter, or parent is on
active duty, or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty,
in support of a contingency operation. The leave will be calculated based on a
rolling twelve-month leave period measured backward from the date an employee
uses any FMLA leave. This leave is available to a family member of a military
member in the National Guard or Reserves; it does not extend to family members
of military members in the Regular Armed Forces. Qualifying exigencies include:
            1.   Issues arising from a covered military member’s short notice
deployment (i.e. deployment on seven or less days of notice) for a period of
seven days from the date of notification;
            2.   Military event and related activities, such as official
ceremonies, programs, or events sponsored by the military or family support or
assistance programs and informational briefings sponsored or promoted by the
military, military service organizations, or the American Red Cross that are
related to the active duty or call to active duty status of a covered military
member;
            3.   Certain childcare and related activities arising from the
active duty or call to active duly status of a covered military member, such as
arranging for alternative childcare, providing childcare on a non-routine,
urgent, immediate need basis, enrolling or transferring a child in a new school
or day care facility, and attending certain meetings at a school or a day care
facility if they are necessary due to circumstances arising from the active
duty or call to active duty of the covered military member;
            4.   Making or updating financial and legal arrangements to address
a covered military member’s absence;
            5.   Attending counseling provided by someone other than a health
care provider for oneself, the covered military member, or the child of the
covered military member, the need for which arises from the active duty or call
to active duty status of the covered military member;

military member who is on short-term temporary, rest and recuperation leave
during deployment;
            7.   Attending to certain post-deployment activities, including

ninety days following the termination of the covered military member’s active
duty status, and addressing issues arising from the death of a covered military
member;
            8.   Any other event that the employee and employer agree is a
qualifying exigency.
      (2)   Participants are requested to provide the Village thirty days
advance notice of the need to take FMLA leave, when the need is foreseeable. In
cases where the need was not foreseeable thirty days in advance, participants
are requested to provide as much notice as reasonably possible.
   (d)   Certification/Re-Certification.
      (1)   In the case of FMLA leave taken under either division (a)(1)C. or
D. above, certification from the health care provider of the medical necessity
for the FMLA leave will be required. The certification shall include: date on
which the serious health condition commenced; probable duration of the
condition; and appropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health
care provider regarding the condition.
      (2)   FMLA leave taken under either Section 3 above, will also require
certification. The certification shall include appropriate facts related to the
particular qualifying exigency leave, including contact information if the
leave involves meeting with a third party. When caring for a covered service
member, certification should be completed by an authorized health care
provider. A copy of an Invitational Travel Order (ITO) or Invitational Travel
Authorization (ITA) issued to any member of the covered service member’s family
would also suffice as a form of certification.
      (3)   In the case of foreseeable FMLA leave, a participant who fails to
provide timely certification after being requested by the Village to furnish
such certification within fifteen calendar days, (if practicable), may be
denied the taking of FMLA leave until the required certification is provided.
When the need for FMLA leave is not foreseeable, a participant must provide
certification within fifteen calendar days after being requested to do so, or
as soon as reasonably possible under the particular facts and circumstances. In
the case of a medical emergency, it may not be practicable for a participant to
provide the requested certification within fifteen calendar days. However, if a
participant fails to provide a medical certification within a reasonable time
under the pertinent circumstances, the Village may deny the participant’s
continuation of FMLA leave.
      (4)   The Village may require the employee to provide periodic reports
during the period of leave of the employee’s status and intent to return to
work. If the Village requests the reports verbally from the employee, the
Village will follow up with a written statement of the requirement(s).
      (5)   The Village may, at its own expense, require the employee to obtain
a second opinion from a health care provider for FMLA leave taken under either
division (a)(1)C. or D.
      (6)   If the opinions of the employee’s and the employer’s designated
health care providers differ, the Village may require the employee to obtain
certification from a third health care provider, again at the expense of the
Village. This third opinion shall be final and binding. The third health care
provider must be approved jointly by the Village and the employee.
      (7)   The Village must provide the employee with a copy of the second and
third medical opinions upon request by the employee within two business days,
unless extenuating circumstances prevent such action.
      (8)   The Village is not permitted to request second and third opinions
or recertification of a covered service member’s serious injury or illness or
of a qualifying exigency for FMLA leave taken under either Section 3 above.
      (9)   An employee will be required to submit a new certification for the
first FMLA absence in each FMLA year. The FMLA year will be calculated based on
a rolling twelve-month leave period measured backward from the date an employee
uses any FMLA leave.
      (10)   Any participant who takes FMLA leave for the participant’s own
serious health condition that makes the participant unable to perform his or
her job, must obtain and present certification from the health care provider
that the participant is able to resume work, with or without reasonable
accommodation.
   (e)   Continuation Of Health Care And Other Benefits.
      (1)   During FMLA leave, the Village will continue payment of any
insurance premiums for continuation of health insurance coverage for the
participant (including family coverage if participant is on the family plan).
Any share of health plan premiums which are paid by the participant prior to
FMLA leave must continue to be paid by the participant during FMLA leave. If
premiums are raised or lowered on the group health insurance coverage while the
participant is on FMLA leave, the participant will be required to pay the new
premium rates. However, if the participant fails to return from FMLA leave
after the period of FMLA leave entitlement has expired, the Village may recover
the premiums paid on the participant’s behalf during FMLA leave, unless the
participant fails to return to work due to continuation, recurrence or onset of
a serious health condition that entitles the participant to FMLA leave under
division (a)(1)C. or D. above, or for other circumstances beyond the control of
the participant.
      (2)   If FMLA leave includes substituted paid leave entitlement (i.e. use
of paid time off), the participant’s share of premiums for group health
coverage will be paid in the usual manner through payroll. When paid leave
entitlement expires, payment of participant’s portion of the health plan
premium as well as any optional life or disability premiums must be made to the
Village by the employee by the fifteenth of each month.
      (3)   Accrued paid time off (sick time, vacation leave and personal time)
must be used concurrent with FMLA leave until the available balance is
completely used. Per the Village’s standard policy on paid time off, new paid
time off is earned for time worked and years of service credit will accrue
during FMLA leave under this policy if using paid time off during FMLA leave.
Any FMLA leave time taken without using paid time off will not accrue paid time
off but will provide credit towards years of service.
      (4)   The participant’s right to continue participation in, or coverage
under, any other benefit plan during FMLA leave is subject to any restrictions,
limitations or conditions contained within the particular Village benefit plan
or in any contract between the Village and any third party under which the
benefit is established or provided.
   (f)   Return to Work.
      (1)   Upon expiration of the period of FMLA leave entitlement, the
participant will resume his or her position with the Village, or an equivalent
position with equivalent benefits, pay and other terms and conditions of
employment. The participant shall be reinstated at the same pay, benefits, and
seniority and subject to all terms and conditions of the position at the time
participant went on FMLA leave, and shall be credited with years of service
accrued and credited immediately prior to commencement of FMLA leave for
purposes of determining benefit levels under the Village’s benefit programs,
subject to any present or future restrictions, limitations, or conditions of
such benefit programs.
      (2)   The Village may require periodic reports from a participant on FMLA
leave regarding the participant’s status and intent to return to work. If the
participant provides a statement of intent to return to work, even if the
statement is qualified, entitlement to FMLA leave and maintenance of health
benefits will continue. However, if the participant gives an unequivocal notice
of intent not to return to work and/or fails to return to work without notice,
the obligations of the Village to provide health benefits (except pursuant to
COBRA requirements) and to restore the participant to work will end.
   (g)   Spouses as participants.
      (1)   Where spouses are both employed by the Village and are otherwise
eligible for FMLA leave, the aggregate number of work weeks of FMLA leave to
which both may be entitled is limited to twelve workweeks during any twelve-
month period for FMLA leave taken under division (a)(1)C. or D. above.
      (2)   Spouses are limited to a combined total of twenty-six workweeks in
a “single twelve-month period” for FMLA leave taken under division (c) above
and for FMLA leave taken under division (a)(1)C. or D. above.
   (h)   Intermittent or reduced FMLA leave.
      (1)   When medically necessary for the illness of a spouse, child, parent
or participant himself or herself, or to care for a covered service member or a
qualifying exigency, a participant may take FMLA leave on an intermittent or
reduced FMLA leave basis. The total amount of workweeks available to an
employee in a twelve-month period, will be based on the type of FMLA leave for
which the employee is eligible. When a participant requests such intermittent
or reduced FMLA leave schedule, the Village may require that the participant
transfer temporarily to an available alternative job position for which the
participant is qualified, at equivalent pay and benefits, where such transfer
better accommodates recurring periods of FMLA leave of the participant. For
FMLA leave that is foreseeable for planned medical treatment, participant must
make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so as not to disrupt unduly
the operations of the Village, and shall provide wherever possible at least
thirty days notice before the date FMLA leave is to begin.
      (2)   Intermittent or reduced FMLA leave can include such things as
doctor appointments for prenatal care, treatment for chronic illnesses, etc.
      (3)   An employee under intermittent FMLA leave for a long-term condition
other than FMLA leave taken under division (c) above, will be required to
submit medical recertification every thirty days provided the employee has been
absent since the last re-certification was completed.
      (4)   An employee will also need to submit a medical recertification in
the event the employee’s need for leave changes, other than FMLA leave taken
under division (c) above, (e.g., a need for more frequent time off or for a
longer duration each occasion than stated in the most recent certification).
   (i)   Misuse or Abuse of FMLA. FMLA leave abuse occurs when an employee uses
leave for unauthorized purposes or misrepresents the actual reason for charging
an absence to FMLA leave. Abuse is cause for discipline, up to and including
dismissal.
(Ord. 10-017. Passed 9-21-10.)
256.08   OHIO PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM CONTRIBUTIONS.
   (a)   (1)   Effective January 1, 1993, the full amount of the statutorily
required contributions to the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System
(P.E.R.S.) shall be withheld from the gross pay of each person within any of
the classes established in division (b) of this section and shall be "picked-
up" (assumed and paid to the P.E.R.S.) by the Village. This pick-up by the
Village is, and shall be designated as, public employee contributions and shall
be in lieu of contributions to the P.E.R.S. by each person within any of the
classes established in division (b) of this section. No person subject to this
pick-up shall have the option of choosing to receive the statutorily required
contribution to the P.E.R.S. directly instead of having it picked-up by the
Village, or of being excluded from the pick-up.
      (2)   The Village shall, in reporting and making remittance to the
P.E.R.S. report that the public employee's contribution for each person subject
to this pick-up has been made as provided by statute.
   (b)   The pick-up by the Village provided by this section shall apply to the
Mayor, Clerk-Treasurer and all members of Council.
   (c)   The Village's method of payment of salary to employees is hereby
modified, in order to provide for a fringe benefit pick-up of employee
contributions to P.E.R.S., as follows: the total salary for each employee shall
be the salary otherwise payable under the Village policies. Such total salary
of each employee shall be payable by the Village in two parts: deferred salary
and cash salary. An employee's deferred salary shall be equal to that
percentage of such employee's total salary which is required, from time to
time, by P.E.R.S. to be paid as an employee contribution by such employee, and
shall be paid by the Village to P.E.R.S. on behalf of such employee as a pick-
up for that employee, and shall be payable, subject to applicable payroll
deductions, to such employee. The Village shall compute and remit its employer
contributions to P.E.R.S. based upon an employee's total salary. The total
combined expenditures of the Village for employee's total salaries payable
under applicable Village policies and the pick-up provisions of this section
shall not be greater than the amounts it would have paid for those items had
this provision not been in effect.
   (d)   The Clerk-Treasurer is hereby authorized and directed to implement the
provisions of this section to institute the pick-up of the statutorily required
contributions to the P.E.R.S. for those positions provided in division (b) of
this section so as to enable them to obtain the result in Federal and State tax
deferments and other benefits.
(Ord. 92-254. Passed 8-18-92.)
256.09   DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE POLICY.
   The Village Administrator is authorized and directed to implement the Drug-
Free Workplace Policy, which policy is set forth below:
   DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE POLICY FOR THE VILLAGE OF GRAFTON
I.   STATEMENT OF POLICY
The Village of Grafton believes that it is very important to provide a safe
workplace for all of its employees. The Village is taking steps to address the
problem of substance use that negatively affects every workplace, including
ours. The Village is concerned with the health and well being of all employees.
Behaviors related to substance use can endanger all employees, not just
substance users. We can't condone and won't tolerate behaviors on the part of
employees that relate to substance use, such as:
   a.   Use of illegal drugs;
   b.   Misuse of alcohol;
   c.   Sale, purchase, transfer, trafficking, use or possession of any illegal
drugs;
   d.   Arrival or return to work under the influence of any drug (legal or
illegal) or alcohol to the extent that job performance is affected.
Management is fully committed to our Drug-Free Workplace Policy which
establishes clear guidelines for acceptable and unacceptable employee behavior
for everyone in the workplace. We will not tolerate substance use in violation
of this Policy and intend to hold everyone reasonably responsible for
supporting the Policy.
This Policy describes the Village's Drug-Free Workplace Program, and every
employee is expected to read and understand it. The Policy applies to every
employee including management, and also applies to contractors and
subcontractors we may use. The consequences stated in this Drug-Free Workplace
Policy will apply to anyone who violates the Policy.
The Village holds all employees accountable in terms of substance use but also
supports getting help for employees. Employees who come forward voluntarily to
identify that they have a substance problem will receive Village support and
assistance. However, if an employee has a substance problem and does not come
forward, and the employee then tests positive for drug or alcohol use in
violation of this Policy, the Village reserves the right to terminate
employment for violation of this work rule. Employees whose jobs are subject to
any special law or regulation may face additional requirements in terms of
substance use. Other consequences that apply to all employees who violate this
Policy are spelled out within this document.
This program will go into effect within 30 days of the announcement of our
Drug-Free Workplace Program and this new Policy that describes our program. Our
Policy covers five key parts of the Village's Program. The five parts are:
   •   a written policy that clearly spells out the program rules and how
everyone benefits.
   •   annual substance awareness education for all employees.
   •   training for supervisors regarding their responsibilities.
   •   drug and alcohol testing, the most effective way to change harmful
behaviors related to substance use.
   •   employee assistance.
Employees will have the opportunity to receive information about how substance
use is a problem affecting the workplace. You will learn the signs and
symptoms, dangers of use, and how and where to get help for yourselves and your
families. The Village Administrator will be our Drug-Free Coordinator so
everyone knows who to go to for information or help. He/she will be responsible
for arranging drug and alcohol testing, as needed, and will have a list of
resources that employees can turn to for help for themselves and/or their
families. He/she will also arrange to get knowledgeable presenters to educate
our employees and supervisors about substance use.
Protections for Employees
This program is designed to protect employees from the behaviors of substance
users. Some of the protections built into the program are:
   •   Employee records, like testing results and referrals for help, will be
kept confidential. Information will be on a need-to-know basis. Any violation
of confidentiality rights is subject to disciplinary action up to and including
termination of employment.
   •   We're committed to employees who have a substance problem getting help.
Each situation will be reviewed individually. Employee assistance is available
for employees and their families a list of resources available through our
Drug-Free Coordinator and posted at Town Hall. We want you to come forward if
you have a substance problem and not wait. If you test positive, you're risking
losing your job.
   •   All supervisors will be trained in their duties related to testing
before this program begins.
   •   All employees will receive substance awareness education every year to
help identify problems and learn where employees can go for help.
   •   Collection of urine specimens and breath testing will be done at a local
clinic, and urine drug test specimens will be analyzed by a laboratory
certified by the Federal government. These labs use the highest level of care
in ensuring that results are accurate, and the process that's used is 100%
accurate in detecting that the substances that the Village is concerned about
are present in the employee in sufficient quantity to lead to behaviors that
may hurt the person or other employees. The lab will work closely with our
local clinic to ensure fairness and accuracy of every test, and we also have a
Medical Review Officer (called an MRO), a trained physician responsible for
checking whether there's a valid reason for the presence of the substance in
the employee's system. The MRO is an expert in drugs and alcohol use. When the
MRO receives positive test results, the MRO will contact the employee and any
appropriate health care provider to determine whether there is a valid reason
for the presence of the drug in the person's system.
   •   The testing program consists of an initial screening test. If the
initial results are positive, then a second test is used. Cut-off levels for
each drug and for alcohol are established for what will be considered a
positive test. These levels show that the employee didn't just have a little of
the substance in his or her system but enough to affect workplace safety and
the ability to do the job. These cut-off levels come from Federal guidelines
and are fair for all employees.
Employee Awareness Education:
Every employee will attend a session in which this policy is discussed. You
will have a chance to ask questions. We'll give everyone a copy of our written
Policy, and everyone will be expected to sign that they received it. Later,
we'll have a qualified person explain why and how substance use is a workplace
problem, the effects, signs/symptoms of use, effects of commonly used drugs in
the workplace, and how to get help. There will be a minimum of two hours of
substance education annually for all employees. New employees will hear about
the program during orientation and will receive substance education as soon as
possible thereafter.
Supervisor Training:
Supervisors will be trained to recognize substance problems that may endanger
the employee and others as well as violate this Policy. This training is in
addition to the employee education session. Supervisors will be trained about
testing responsibilities, how to recognize behaviors that demonstrate an
alcohol/drug problem and how to make referrals for help.
Drug and Alcohol Testing:
Testing will be used to detect problems, get employees not to use substances in
a way that they violate Village Policy and then allow the Village to take
appropriate action to correct the situation. In addition to alcohol, the drugs
that we're testing for are:
   •   Amphetamines (speed, uppers)
   •   Cocaine (including crack cocaine)
   •   Marijuana
   •   Opiates (codeine, heroin, morphine)
   •   Phencyclidine (PCP, "angel dust")
Employee Assistance:
The Village believes in offering assistance to employees with a substance
problem. The Village does not have a rehabilitation program and will not pay
for an employee to attend a program, but the Village is supportive of employees
taking action on their own behalf to address a substance problem. The Village
has a list of local community resources to give to employees who come forward
voluntarily to seek help. The list includes places to go for an assessment and
for treatment. When an employee has a substance problem, the Policy Coordinator
will meet with the employee to discuss the problem and any violation of this
Policy. The Village reserves the right to terminate based on a positive test.
II.   WHEN WILL A TEST OCCUR?
Employees will be tested for the presence of drugs in the urine and/or alcohol
on the breath under any and/or all of the conditions outlined below:
A.   Post-Offer, Pre-Employment Medical Examination and Drug Testing
As part of the Village's employment procedures, all applicants will be required
to undergo a post-offer, pre-employment medical examination and a drug test
conducted by a contractor the Village designates. Any offer of employment
depends upon satisfactory completion of this examination and/or screening, and
the determination by the Village and its examining physician that the person is
capable of performing the responsibilities of the position that has been
offered.
B.   Reasonable Suspicion Testing
Reasonable suspicion testing will occur when management has reason to suspect
that an employee may be in violation of this Policy. The suspicion will be
documented in writing prior to the release of the test findings. A reasonable
suspicion test may occur based on:
   1.   Observed behavior, such as direct observation of drug/alcohol use or
possession and/or physical symptoms of drug and/or alcohol use;
   2.   A pattern of abnormal conduct or erratic behavior;
   3.   Arrest or conviction for a drug-related offense, or identification of
an employee as the focus of a criminal investigation into illegal drug
possession, use, or trafficking. The employee is responsible for notification
of the Village, within five (5) working days, of any drug-related conviction;
   4.   Information provided either by reliable and credible sources or
independently corroborated regarding an employee's substance use; or
   5.   Newly discovered evidence that the employee has tampered with a
previous drug or alcohol test.
Reasonable suspicion testing does not require certainty, but mere ''hunches"
are not sufficient to justify testing. To prevent this, all managers/
supervisors will be trained to recognize drug and alcohol-related signs and
symptoms. Testing may be for drugs or alcohol or both.
C.   Post-Accident Testing
Post-accident testing will be conducted whenever an accident occurs, regardless
of whether there's an injury. We consider an accident an unplanned, unexpected
or unintended event that occurs on our property, during the conduct of our
business, or during working hours, or which involves one of our motor vehicles
or motor vehicles that are used in conducting company business, or is within
the scope of employment, and which results in any of the following:
   (i)   A fatality of anyone involved in the accident;
   (ii)   Bodily injury to the employee and/or another person that requires
off-site medical attention away from the Village's place of employment;
   (iii)   Vehicular damage in apparent excess of $750.00; or
   (iv)   Non-vehicular damage in apparent excess of $500.00.
When such an accident results in one of the situations below, any employee who
may have contributed to the accident will be tested for drugs or alcohol use or
both.
Drug and/or Alcohol Testing after an Accident
Urine specimen collection (for drugs) or breath/saliva (for alcohol) is to
occur as quickly as possible after a need to test has been determined. At no
time will a urine specimen be collected after 32 hours from the time of an
employment-related incident. Breath or saliva alcohol testing will be performed
as quickly as possible but no later than eight hours after the incident, or it
will be documented but not performed. If the employee responsible for an
employment-related accident is injured, it is a condition of employment that
the employee grants the Village the right to request that attending medical
personnel obtain appropriate specimens (breath, urine and/or blood) for the
purpose of conducting alcohol and/or drug testing. Further, all employees grant
the Village access to any and all other medical information that may be
relevant in conducting a complete and thorough investigation of the work-
related accident including a full medical report from the examining physician
(s) or other health care providers. A signed consent to testing form is
considered a condition of employment. Management reserves the right to
determine who may have caused or contributed to a work-related accident and may
choose not to test after minor accidents if there is no violation of a safety
or work rule, minor damage and/or injuries and no reasonable suspicion.
D.   Follow up Testing after Return-to-Duty from Assessment or Treatment
This test occurs when an employee who has previously tested positive and the
decision is made to not terminate the employee under a “last-chance” agreement.
A negative return-to-duty test is required before the employee will be allowed
to return to work. If the employee fails this test, this will lead to
termination of employment. Once an employee passes the drug and/or alcohol test
and returns to work, management may choose to do additional unannounced tests
for as long as we deem necessary. Any employee with a second positive test
result will be terminated. Follow-up tests will be unannounced and may occur at
any time for a time period that management considers reasonable. The intent is
to deter any subsequent usage that would result in a violation of our Policy
and result in termination of employment.
III.   SUBSTANCES TO BE TESTED FOR AND METHODS OF TESTING
The procedure that the Village is relying on is called systems presence
testing. This is how qualified testing professionals identify the presence of
one or more of prohibited controlled substances or alcohol that may be present
in the employee. There is an initial screening test. If it's negative, then a
negative test is declared. If the initial test is positive (comes in at or
higher than the cut-off level), a second test called a “confirmatory” test is
done. This is a different test and is considered 100% accurate by experts and
in court. Cut-off levels are standards that have been established for each of
the tested drugs after years of research. These levels will be used to
interpret all drug screens/tests, whether for a pre-employment examination,
reasonable suspicion test, post-accident test or follow up test.
Breath alcohol testing will be conducted by a medical clinic that uses only
certified equipment and personnel. Breath alcohol concentrations exceeding .04
will be considered a verified positive result, in the event of an accident
where an employee has “whole blood” alcohol drawn at a medical treatment
facility, a result equal to or greater than .04 shall be considered to be a
verified positive result. An Evidentiary Breath Test (EBT) will typically be
used to confirm any initial positive test result. The Company also reserves the
right to add or delete substances on the list above, especially if mandated by
changes in existing Federal, State or local regulations or laws.
An employee who adulterates, attempts to adulterate or substitutes a specimen
or otherwise manipulates the testing process will be terminated. A refusal to
produce/provide a specimen is considered a positive test unless there's a
verifiable medical reason that the specimen could not be produced.
IV.   SPECIMEN COLLECTION PROCEDURE
Urine specimens and breath testing will be conducted by trained collection
personnel who meet standards for urine collection and breath alcohol testing.
Confidentiality is required from our collection sites and labs. Employees are
permitted to provide urine specimens in private, but subject to strict scrutiny
by collection personnel so as to avoid any alteration or substitution of the
specimen. Breath alcohol testing will likewise be done in an area that affords
the individual privacy. In all cases, there will only be one individual tested
at a time. Failure to appear for testing when scheduled shall be considered
refusal to participate in testing, and will subject an employee to the range of
disciplinary actions, including dismissal, and an applicant to the cancellation
of an offer of employment. An observed voiding will only occur if there is
grounds for suspecting manipulation of the testing process.
V.   REVIEW OF TEST RESULTS
To ensure that every employee who is tested is treated fairly, we have hired a
Medical Review Officer (“MRO”). The MRO is a doctor with a specialized
knowledge of substance abuse disorders and will be able to determine whether
there are any valid reasons for the presence in the employee's system of the
substance that was tested positive.
VI.   EMPLOYEES' RIGHTS WHEN THERE'S A POSITIVE TEST RESULT
An employee who tests positive under this Policy will be given an opportunity
to explain the findings to the MRO prior to the issuance of a positive test
result to the Company. Upon receipt of a confirmed positive finding, the MRO
will attempt to contact the employee by telephone or in person. If contact is
made by the MRO, the employee will be informed of the positive finding and
given an opportunity to rebut or explain the findings. The MRO can request
information on recent medical history and on medications taken within the last
thirty days by the employee.
If the MRO finds support in the explanation offered by the employee, the
employee may be asked to provide documentary evidence to support the employee's
position (for example, the names of treating physicians, pharmacies where
prescriptions have been filled, etc.). A failure on the part of the employee to
provide such documentary evidence will result in the issuance of a positive
report by the MRO with no attendant medical explanation. A medical
disqualification of the employee will result. If the employee fails to contact
the MRO as instructed, the MRO will issue a positive report to the Company.
VII.   REPORTING OF RESULTS
All test results will be reported to the MRO prior to the results being issued
to the company. The MRO will receive a detailed report of the findings of the
analysis from the testing laboratory. Each substance tested for will be listed
along with the results of the testing. The company will receive a summary
report, and this report will indicate that the employee passed or failed the
test. All of these procedures are intended to be consistent with the most
current guidelines for Medical Review Officers, published by the Federal
Department of Health and Human Services.
VIII.   STORAGE OF TEST RESULTS AND RIGHT TO REVIEW TEST RESULTS
All records of drug/alcohol testing will be stored separately and apart from
the employee's general personnel documents. These records shall be maintained
under lock and key at all times. Access is limited to designated company
officials. The information contained in these files shall be utilized only to
properly administer this Policy and to provide to certifying agencies for
review as required by law. Designated company officials that shall have access
to these records are charged with the responsibility of maintaining the
confidentiality of these records. Any breach of confidentiality with regard to
these records may be an offense resulting in termination of employment. Any
employees tested under this Policy have the right to review and/or receive a
copy of their own test results. An employee may request from the Drug-Fee
Coordinator, in writing, presenting a duly notarized Employee Request for
Release of Drug Tests Results form, requesting that a copy of the test be
provided. The company will use its best efforts to promptly comply with this
request and will issue to the employee a copy of the results personally or by
U.S. Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested.
IX.   POSITIVE TEST RESULTS
Employees who are found to have a confirmed positive drug or alcohol test will
be immediately taken off safety-sensitive duties and are subject to discipline
up to and including termination.
X.   TERMINATION NOTICES
In those cases where substance testing results in the termination of
employment, all termination notices will list “misconduct” as the reason.
Termination shall be deemed “for cause.”

   SAMPLE LAST CHANCE AGREEMENT
   On              , the Village's Drug-Free Coordinator, and Mayor agreed to
your request to seek counseling and referral to a rehabilitation program for
alcohol and drug use. The following conditions apply to your rehabilitation
program:
   1.   You must authorize                         to provide proof of
enrollment in an alcohol/drug abuse rehabilitation program and proof of
attendance at all required sessions on a monthly basis to the Village's Drug-
Free Coordinator. The Village will closely monitor your attendance and will
terminate your employment (cancel this agreement) if you do not regularly
attend all required sessions.
   2.   You will pay for all costs of rehabilitation that are not covered under
the Village's benefits plan.
   3.   During the                          month/months following completion
of your rehabilitation program, the Village may test you for alcohol and/or
drug use on an unannounced basis to determine if you are in compliance with the

COMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLES.
   (a)   Objectives; Application. The Village of Grafton is required by Federal
regulations to implement an alcohol and controlled substance testing program
for drivers of commercial motor vehicles. The following policy has been adopted
by the Village in compliance with said regulations in order to reduce highway
accidents resulting from the use of controlled substances and to protect the
safety and well being of the public, contractors and their employees. This
policy will apply to all employee drivers and independent contractors who wish
to enter into contracts to drive for the Village, and to their employees, as
well as to all incumbent contractor/drivers and their employees, effective
January 1, 1996. This policy describes and summarizes the regulations found in
the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSR), Parts 382 and 40. These
Regulations should be referenced with respect to any questions that may arise
from the policy that follows. With respect to division (g) of this section, the
Village of Grafton has supplemented the Regulations regarding suspension and
termination.
   (b)   General Policy Statement. An alcohol-free and drug-free work force is
critical for the Village and is in the best interest of public safety. The
driver who uses alcohol and/or drugs is a hazard to himself or herself, to
other workers and to the general public. It is the Village's policy that
alcohol misuse on the job and drug users be quickly identified and removed from
the work environment.
   (c)   Applicability. This policy and the regulations that require it shall

disorders.
   (e)   Alcohol and Controlled Substance Testing.
      (1)   Pre-employment requirements.
         A.   All drivers who the Village intends to employ or enter into a
contract with will be tested for the use of alcohol and controlled substances
prior to the first time a driver performs a safety- sensitive function for the
Village.
         B.   Such drivers will be notified that a breath and urine sample will
be tested for the presence of alcohol and controlled substances.
         C.   The Village will not allow a driver to perform a safety-sensitive
function unless the results of the breath alcohol test indicates a breath
alcohol level of less than 0.02 and unless the Village has received a
controlled substance test result from the medical review officer indicating a
verified negative test.
         D.   If the results of a driver's alcohol test indicate a breath
alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04, the driver will
not be permitted to perform safety-sensitive functions until the start of the
driver's next regularly-scheduled duty period, but not less than 24 hours
following the administration of the test.
         E.   Any individual who refuses to submit to a controlled substance
test or who tests positive for a controlled substance shall be deemed medically
unqualified to operate a commercial vehicle and shall not be offered employment
or a contract to drive for the Village.
      (2)   Reasonable suspicion testing.
         A.   The Village will require drivers to be tested for the use of
alcohol and controlled substances upon reasonable suspicion. (Reasonable
suspicion testing carries different procedures for alcohol and controlled
substances. Please refer to Part 382 and Part 40 of the Regulations for more
detail regarding this portion of the policy and the Regulations.)
         B.   1.   Conduct by drivers constituting reasonable suspicion must be
witnessed by one supervisor. This observation for alcohol must be based on
specific, contemporaneous and articulable observations concerning the
appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the driver. The observation for
controlled substances may include indications of the chronic and withdrawal
effects of controlled substances.
      2.   The Village must ensure that persons designated to determine whether
reasonable suspicion exists, so as to require a driver to be tested for alcohol
and/or controlled substances, receive a minimum of sixty minutes of training on
alcohol misuse and a minimum of sixty minutes of training on controlled
substance misuse.
         C.   Reasonable suspicion testing shall be authorized only if the
observation as described in division (e)(2)B. of this section above is made
during, just before or just after the driver has been, will be or was
performing a safety-sensitive function.
         D.   Once a driver has been notified that a reasonable suspicion test
will be conducted, such test shall take place within two hours of issuance of
the notice. If the test is not accomplished by the Village within two hours, a
written record shall be made stating the reasons the alcohol test was not
promptly administered. If the test has not been accomplished within eight hours
following notification, the Village shall stop its attempt to administer the
test and make and retain in its files a record of the reasons the alcohol test
was not properly administered.
         E.   A written record shall be made documenting the driver's conduct
with respect to an alcohol and/or controlled substance reasonable suspicion and
must be signed by the supervisor or company official who observed the behavior.
         F.   The possession of alcohol does not constitute a need for a
reasonable suspicion test as set forth in divisions (e)(2)A. to E. of this
section. Reasonable suspicion must be based on observations concerning the
driver's appearance, behavior, speech or body odors.
      (3)   Random testing.
         A.   The Village shall utilize a random selection process to select
and request drivers to be tested for the use of alcohol and controlled
substances.
         B.   The random tests conducted annually for controlled substances
shall equal or exceed fifty percent of the driver positions available, and
random alcohol tests conducted annually shall equal or exceed twenty-five
percent of the driver positions available.
         C.   A driver shall only be tested randomly for alcohol when he or she
is performing safety-sensitive functions or immediately prior to or after
performing a safety-sensitive function.
         D.   Drivers must submit to these tests when selected by a random
selection process utilized by the Village. These tests will not be announced in
advance and will be spread reasonably throughout the year.
         E.   After a driver is randomly selected for a test, the driver must
immediately proceed to the testing site upon notification of being selected.
         F.   Once a driver is notified of the requirement to take a random
alcohol and/or controlled substance test, provided that the driver was
performing a safety sensitive function at the time of the notification, the
Village will ensure that the driver ceases to perform the safety-sensitive
function and proceeds to the testing site as soon as possible.
         G.   If a driver who has been randomly selected for a test is on
vacation or an extended medical absence, the Village may either select another
driver (alternate) for testing or keep the original selection confidential
until the driver returns.
      (4)   Post-accident testing. Nothing in this policy (or in the
Regulations) should be construed as to require the delay of necessary medical
attention for injured persons following an accident, or to prohibit a driver
from obtaining assistance as needed to respond to the accident or to obtain
necessary emergency medical care.
         A.   Drivers shall provide a breath and urine sample to be tested for
the use of alcohol and controlled substances as soon as possible following an
accident involving a fatality or a recordable accident in which the driver
receives a citation for a moving traffic violation.
         B.   A post-accident test must take place within two hours of the
accident or as soon as practical. If the alcohol test is not accomplished
within two hours by the Village, a written record shall be made stating the
reasons the alcohol test was not promptly administered. If the test has not
been accomplished within eight hours following the accident, the Village shall
stop its attempt to administer the alcohol test and make and retain in its
files a record of the reasons the alcohol test was not properly administered.
         C.   If a driver has not submitted to a controlled substance test
within 32 hours of the accident, the Village shall stop its attempt to
administer the controlled substance test and make and retain in its files a
record of the reasons the test was not properly administered.
         D.   A driver who is seriously injured and cannot provide a specimen
at the time of the accident shall provide the necessary authorization for
obtaining medical reports and other documents which would indicate whether
there were any alcohol or controlled substances in his or her system at the
time of the accident.
         E.   The Village may use, by permission from the Federal Highway
Administration, post-accident tests conducted by Federal, State and local
officials, and such tests shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this
section under the following conditions:
            1.   The official must have independent authority to conduct the
test;
            2.   The test must conform to Federal, State and local
requirements;
            3.   The alcohol test must require blood or breath samples; and
            4.   The controlled substances test must require a urine sample.
         F.   A driver who is subject to post-accident testing must remain
available or the Village will consider the driver to have refused to submit to
testing.
      (5)   Return-to-duty and follow-up testing.
         A.   The Village shall ensure that before a driver returns to duty
requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions, after engaging in
prohibited conduct regarding alcohol misuse and/or controlled substance use,
the driver shall be tested for alcohol and/or controlled substances. In order
to return to duty, a driver must test negative for substance abuse and have a
breath alcohol concentration of less than 0.02.
         B.   In the event that a driver is required to complete a return-to-
duty test, the driver must also be evaluated by a substance abuse professional
(SAP) and participate in the assistance program prescribed by the SAP.
         C.   Follow-up testing should be performed by the Village on an
unannounced basis as instructed by the SAP. A driver shall be subject to a
minimum of six follow-up controlled substance and/or alcohol tests in the first
twelve months. Alcohol follow- up tests shall only be administered when the
driver is performing a safety-sensitive function, either immediately prior to
or after the safety-sensitive function is performed.
   (f)   Alcohol and Controlled Substance Prohibitions.
      (1)   No driver shall perform a safety-sensitive function while having a
breath alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater.
      (2)   No driver shall perform safety-sensitive functions within four
hours after using alcohol. No employer having actual knowledge that a driver
has used alcohol within four hours shall permit a driver to perform or continue
to perform safety-sensitive functions.
      (3)   No driver shall possess any quantity of alcohol while on duty
unless the alcohol is manifested and transported as a part of the load. This
includes any medicines, both prescription and over-the-counter, that contain
alcohol, unless the packaging seal is unbroken.
      (4)   No driver shall use alcohol while performing a safety-sensitive
function.
      (5)   When involved in an accident that requires a post-accident alcohol
test, the driver shall not use alcohol within eight hours of the accident or
prior to submitting to the post-accident test, whichever comes first.
      (6)   No driver shall refuse to submit to an alcohol or controlled
substance test as required by this policy. Any refusal shall be treated in the
same manner as a positive alcohol or substance abuse screen.
      (7)   No driver shall perform a safety-sensitive function when the driver
uses controlled substances, except when prescribed by a physician who has
determined that the substance will not adversely affect the driver's ability to
safely drive a commercial motor vehicle.
      (8)   No driver shall perform a safety-sensitive function if the driver
has tested positive for controlled substances.
   (g)   Consequences of Alcohol Misuse and Drug Use.
      (1)   Drivers who are known to have engaged in behavior prohibited by
this policy shall be suspended or terminated. The Village shall determine which
option is in the best interests of the Village.
      (2)   Drivers who are suspended shall be informed by the Village of
resources available to them to resolve their problem of alcohol misuse or drug
use. Any period of inpatient drug or alcohol treatment prescribed for or chosen
by the driver which results in missed work days shall be covered by the
employee's sick days and/or vacation. Under no circumstances shall the Village
be held financially responsible for any of the driver/employee's treatment
costs or missed work days.
      (3)   Following return to work, drivers shall be evaluated by a substance
abuse professional (SAP) on what course of action is needed to assist the
driver in resolving his or her problem with alcohol misuse and drug use. The
SAP will monitor the driver's rehabilitation to determine if the driver has
followed the prescribed program. This portion of the policy is provided as
information only. It does not indicate that the Village is required to
rehabilitate a driver who has tested positive with respect to alcohol or
controlled substances. The Village will consider drivers who test positive to
be medically unqualified and such drivers shall be disqualified from driving
for the Village.
   (h)   Supervisor Training.
      (1)   The Village will designate and provide training to supervisors in
the recognition of observable behavior that is indicative of misuse of alcohol
and controlled substance use. Sixty minutes of training shall be provided for
both alcohol misuse and controlled substance use, for a total of 120 minutes.
      (2)   The prescribed training shall include a review of physical
behavior, speech and performance indicators consistent with alcohol misuse and
controlled substance use.
   (i)   Procedures.
      (1)   Drug-testing requirements. The Village is required by Federal
regulations to test for alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines and
phencyclidine. The Village may, however, upon reasonable cause, require drivers
to be tested for other illegal drugs. In such event, a second urine sample will
be provided by the driver.
      (2)   Preparation for testing.
         A.   Controlled Substances.
            1.   A urine sample will be used for ail controlled substance tests
provided for herein.
            2.   “Split sample” procedures will be used as outlined in Part 40
of the FMCSR for all controlled substance tests conducted on or after August
15, 1994. Under this provision, a driver whose urine sample has tested positive
for a controlled substance has the option (within seventy-two hours after being
notified by the medical review officer) of having the remaining portion of the
split sample tested at another laboratory at the driver's own cost. If the
second test produces negative results, the test is considered negative and no
further sanctions are imposed.
            3.   A standard urine custody and control form will be used.
            4.   A tamper-proof system for sealing specimen bottles will be
used.
            5.   A special shipping container designed to prevent undetected
tampering will be used.
            6.   Procedures, instructions and training for the collection site
will be provided by the Village or the third-party vendor selected by the
Village to provide this service.
         B.   Alcohol.
            1.   A breath sample will be used for all alcohol tests required
and provided for herein.
            2.   All Breath Alcohol Technicians (BATs) will be trained in
proficient operation of the EBT and in the alcohol testing procedures contained
in Part 40 of the Regulations, either by the Village or the third-party vendor
providing this service for the Village.
            3.   The Village (or its third-party vendor) will conduct alcohol
testing in a location that allows visual and actual privacy to the individual
being tested, sufficient to prevent unauthorized persons from seeing or hearing
test results.
            4.   No unauthorized persons will be permitted access to the
testing location when the EBT remains unsecured, or in order to prevent such
persons from seeing or hearing a test result at any time when testing is being
conducted.
            5.   The Village will use the breath alcohol testing form as
prescribed in Part 40 of the Regulations. A log book shall be used for an EBT
used for screening tests that does not meet the requirements of Part 40.53(b)
1-3.
         C.   Specimen collection.
            1.   A collection site will be designated by the Village.
            2.   Security measures will be taken to prevent unauthorized access
which could compromise the integrity of the collection process or the specimen.
            3.   The chain of custody of the urine specimen will be carefully
documented.
            4.   Special precautions will be taken to ensure that access to
urine specimens is restricted to authorized personnel.
            5.   Procedures for collecting urine specimens will allow
individual privacy, except under circumstances indicating that a particular
individual may alter or substitute the specimen as defined by Federal
regulations.
            6.   Rules designed to preserve the integrity and identity of urine
specimens will be carefully followed.
            7.   Controlled collections and transportation of collections to
the laboratory will be handled by the Village or its third- party vendor
pursuant to all applicable sections of the Federal regulations.
   (j)   Reporting and Review of Results.
      (1)   A medical review officer will review the controlled substance
testing results prior to transmission of the results to the Village.
      (2)   Prior to final verification of positive test results, the medical
review officer will give the driver an opportunity to discuss the test results.
      (3)   The Village's contracts with laboratories will require the
laboratory to maintain all drivers' test records in confidence as required by
Department of Transportation agency regulations.
      (4)   Any driver who is the subject of a drug test shall, upon written
request, have access to any records relating to his or her drug test and any
records relating to testing results as described below.
      (5)   The Village will only use laboratories certified under the
Department of Health and Human Services Mandatory Guidelines for Federal
Workplace Drug Testing and Program.
   (k)   Notification of Test Results and Record Keeping.
      (1)   The Village will notify a driver of the results of a pre-employment
alcohol and/or controlled substance test, provided that the driver requests
said test results within sixty days of being notified of the Village's decision
as to whether or not it will enter into employment or lease contract with him
or her.
      (2)   The Village will notify incumbent drivers of the results of random,
reasonable suspicion and post-accident alcohol and/or controlled substance
tests, provided that the results were positive, and will also advise the driver
of what controlled substance was detected or what alcohol level was discovered.

      (4)   All records related to the collection process and required training
shall be retained for a minimum period of two years.
      (5)   A medical review officer will serve as the sole custodian of
individual test results and will retain the reports of individual test results
for a minimum of five years.
      (6)   The Village will retain in its files information which will
indicate only the following:
         A.   That the driver submitted to a controlled substance test;
         B.   The date of the test;
         C.   The location of the test;
         D.   The identity of the person conducting the test; and
         E.   Whether the test finding was positive or negative.
   (l)   Release of Testing Information by Previous Employers.
      (1)   The Village may obtain from any previous employer of the driver
information related to the driver's participation in an alcohol and drug
testing program. The Village will obtain written permission from the driver to
acquire this information.
      (2)   The Village will obtain and review the information listed below
from any previous employer for which the driver performed safety- sensitive
functions in the previous two years. The Village will request and review this
information within fourteen days after the driver first performs a safety-
sensitive function. The information will include:
         A.   Any breath alcohol tests that indicated concentrations of 0.04 or
greater;
         B.   Positive controlled substance tests; and
         C.   Any refusals to submit to a required alcohol or controlled
substance test.
      (3)   The Village will provide the previous employers of the past two
years with the driver's written consent to release the information upon
request. The Village may obtain the information via personal interview,
telephone interview, letter or other method, as long as measures are taken to
ensure confidentiality. The Village will maintain a written, confidential
record with respect to each of the past employers contacted.
      (4)   The Village will not use a driver to perform safety-sensitive
functions if the Village obtains information indicating the driver has tested
positive for controlled substances, tested at or above 0.04 breath alcohol
concentration, or refused to test, unless the employer has evidence that the
driver has been evaluated by a SAP, completed any required counseling, passed a
return-to-duty test and been subject to follow-up testing.

TITLE TEN - Judiciary
            Chap.
290.   Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 290
Mayor's Court
EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Grafton has
jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a
Grafton ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving moving
traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the corporate
limits of Grafton, subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and 2938.04.
In keeping his or her docket and file, the Mayor shall be governed by the laws
pertaining to county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him or her unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him or her, waives a
jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such
event, does not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then the magistrate
shall require the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court
of record in Lorain County (the Elyria Municipal Court) and the magistrate
shall thereupon certify all papers filed, together with a transcript of
proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such recognizance, if given, to the
court of record. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure
provides that in petty offense cases, where there is a right to jury trial, the
defendant shall be tried by the court unless he or she demands a jury trial.
The jurisdiction of a Mayor's Court, in such cases, is further limited by Rule
9 of the Ohio Traffic Rules, which provides that if a jury demand is not made
pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant waives his or her right to jury
trial in writing, a mayor may try the case only if (1) his or her compensation
as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case convictions, or (2) he
or she is not the chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall
be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the
clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for
trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for
trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04
provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of record,
but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Grafton ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated "Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas," the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.
      Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor’s Courts were authorized to
suspend the operator’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section
434.01 of the Traffic Code (OVI), in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4507.16(B).

290.02   Mayor's Court Fund.
290.025   Mayor's Court DUI/Housing/ Indigent Driver's Fund.

amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the

      (3)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation,
or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in
division (b)(2) of this section that indicates that the offender was distracted

414.02   THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
414.03   TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start
to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians
facing a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not
enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(ORC 4511.13)
414.04   SIGNAL TO CONTROL LANE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(ORC 4511.131)
414.05   PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don't walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

   (a)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;

device.
   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the

      (2)   Nothing in division (b)(1) of this section requires a driver of a
slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (c)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic-control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or

distance ahead to permit the overtaking and passing to be completely made
without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken. In every event, the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable, and
in the event the passing movement involves the use of a lane authorized for the

when traveling upon a roadway outside a business or residence district, shall
maintain a sufficient space, whenever conditions permit, between the vehicle
and another vehicle ahead so an overtaking motor vehicle may enter and occupy
the space without danger. This division (a) does not prevent overtaking and
passing nor does it apply to any lane specially designated for use by trucks.
      (3)   Motor vehicles being driven upon any roadway outside of a business
or residence district in a caravan or motorcade shall maintain a sufficient

of the roadway being entered. Whenever practicable, the left turn shall be made
in that portion of the intersection to the left of the center of the
intersection.
      (3)   At any intersection where traffic is restricted to one direction on
one or more of the roadways, the driver of a vehicle intending to turn left at

   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, "Emergency medical
technician-intermediate" and "Emergency medical technician-paramedic" have the
same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,

(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)    The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(c),
(G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
      “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
      If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.
or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state
O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased
penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
      (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
      If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(6) of this section or division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a
chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting
officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit of the person and immediately forward it to the court in
which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is
not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest,
and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the license or
permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon
receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person's initial appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C.
4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.
(ORC 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension effective immediately. A suspension of a person's
driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

      (1)   Whoever violates any provisions of divisions (a)(1)A. through (a)
(1) I. or (a)(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the
influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever
violates division (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle

felony to be prosecuted under appropriate State law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
division (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver's or occupational driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19 as a result of the
conviction or guilty plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4511.191(F)(2).
      (3)   A.   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under Ohio R.C.
4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) or (ii) or (G)(1)(c)(i) or (ii) and if, within 60 days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the 60-day period following the date of sentencing, the court may
impose an alternative sentence as specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(3) that
includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous
alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.
         B.   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by Ohio
R.C. 4511.19(G)(1), the court may sentence the offender as provided in Ohio

      (4)   If an offender's driver's or occupational driver's license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended under division (h) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G) and if Ohio R.C. 4510.13 permits the court
to grant limited driving privileges, the court may grant the limited driving
privileges in accordance with that section. If division (A)(7) of that section
requires the court impose as a condition of the privileges that the offender
must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of
the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).
      (5)   Fines imposed under this section for a violation of division (a) of
this section shall be distributed as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(5).

independent of any other penalty established by law, the court may fine the
offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the National
Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds of any fine so imposed shall be
distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, the court, in addition to any
other penalties provided by law, may order restitution pursuant to Section
698.02(f) or Ohio R.C. 2929.18 or 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five
thousand dollars ($5,000.00) for any economic loss arising from an accident or
collision that was the direct and proximate result of the offender’s operation
of the vehicle before, during, or after committing the offense for which the
offender is sentenced under division (h) of this section.
      (8)   A court may order an offender to reimburse a law enforcement agency

concentration of a controlled substance or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in the offender's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine at the

the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. In addition to
any other sanction imposed for the offense, the court shall impose a class six
suspension of the offender's driver's license, commercial driver's license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating
privilege from the range specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(6). The court may
grant limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under R.C. §§
4510.021 and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an
ignition interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period
of suspension as authorized under R.C. § 4510.022. If the court grants
unlimited driving privileges under R.C. § 4510.022, the court shall suspend any
jail term imposed under division (i)(1) of this section as required under that
section.
      (2)   If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has

arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate result
of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or after committing
the violation of division (b) of this section.

Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services.
      (2)   An offender who stays in a drivers' intervention program or in an
alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an

this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court's indigent drivers' alcohol
treatment fund.
   (k)   If a person whose driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended under this section or Ohio R.C.
4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of the person's trial or sentence,
the appeal itself does not stay the operation of the suspension.
   (l)   Division (a)(1)J. of this section does not apply to a person who
operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the amount
specified in that division, if both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a
prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
      (2)   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled substance
in accordance with the health professional’s directions.
   (m)   The prohibited concentrations of a controlled substance or a
metabolite of a controlled substance listed in division (a)(1)J. of this
section also apply in a prosecution of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.16(D) in
the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited
concentration of alcohol.
   (n)   All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to this section. If the
meaning of a term defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 conflicts with the meaning of
the same term as defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01 or 4511.01, the term as defined
in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 applies to this section.
(ORC 4511.19(G) - (M))
   (o)   Physical Control of Vehicle While Under the Influence.

being in the driver's position of the front seat of a vehicle and having
possession of the vehicle's ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   Generally. No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if,
at the time of the physical control, any of the following apply:

a combination of them.
         B.   The person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
contains at least the concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., or (a)(1)E. of this section.
         C.   Except as provided in division (o)(5) of this section, the person

a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or
urine that equals or exceeds the concentration specified in division (a)(1)J.
of this section.
      (3)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of this section, if a law enforcement officer has administered a
field sobriety test to the person in physical control of the vehicle involved
in the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally acceptable field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect what were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.

division (o)(3)A.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence, and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         B.   Division (o)(3)A. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by

434.04   SLOW SPEED; POSTED MINIMUM SPEEDS.
   (a)   No person shall stop or operate a vehicle at such an unreasonably slow
speed as to impede or block the normal and reasonable movement of traffic,
except when stopping or reduced speed is necessary for safe operation or to
comply with law.
   (b)   Whenever the Director of Transportation or local authorities determine
on the basis of an engineering and traffic investigation that slow speeds on
any part of a controlled-access highway, expressway, or freeway consistently
impede the normal and reasonable movement of traffic, the Director or such
local authority may declare a minimum speed limit below which no person shall
operate a motor vehicle, except when necessary for safe operation or in
compliance with the law. No minimum speed limit established hereunder shall be
less than 30 miles per hour, greater than 50 miles per hour, nor effective
until the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4511.21 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, relating to appropriate signs, have been fulfilled and
local authorities have obtained the approval of the Director.

elevated structure constituting a part of a highway at a speed which is greater
than the maximum speed that can be maintained with safety to such bridge or
structure, when such structure is posted with signs as provided in this
section.
      (2)   The Department of Transportation upon request from any local
authority shall, or upon its own initiative may, conduct an investigation of
any bridge or other elevated structure constituting a part of a highway, and if
it finds that such structure cannot with safety withstand traffic traveling at
the speed otherwise permissible under this Traffic Code, the Department shall
determine and declare the maximum speed of traffic which such structure can
withstand, and shall cause or permit suitable signs stating such maximum speed
to be erected and maintained at a distance of a least 100 feet before each end
of the structure.
      (3)   Upon the trial of any person charged with a violation of this
section, proof of such determination of the maximum speed by the Department and
the existence of such signs shall constitute prima facie evidence of the
maximum speed which can be maintained with safety to such bridge or structure.

section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a

434.06   SPEED EXCEPTIONS FOR EMERGENCY OR SAFETY VEHICLES.
   The prima facie speed limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 4511.21 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance do not apply to emergency vehicles
or public safety vehicles when they are responding to emergency calls and are
equipped with and displaying at least one flashing, rotating, or oscillating
light visible under normal atmospheric conditions from a distance of 500 feet
to the front of the vehicle, and when the drivers thereof sound audible signals
by bell, siren, or exhaust whistle. This section does not relieve the driver of
an emergency vehicle or public safety vehicle from the duty to drive with due
regard for the safety of all persons using the street or highway.
(ORC 4511.24)
434.07   STREET RACING PROHIBITED.

more vehicles from a point side by side at accelerating speeds in a competitive
attempt to outdistance each other, or the operation of one or more vehicles
over a common selected course, from the same point to the same point, wherein
timing is made of the participating vehicles involving competitive
accelerations or speeds. Persons rendering assistance in any manner to such
competitive use of vehicles shall be equally charged as the participants. The

described in Ohio R.C. 2903.081 in a particular construction zone in accordance
with those guidelines and design specifications does not limit or affect the
application of division (a)(1), (a)(2)A., (a)(3)A., or (a)(4) of this section

vehicle's license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
            3.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender's name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of this section, or any
combination of three or more violations of this section or Ohio R.C. 4510.11,
4510.111 or 4510.16, or of a substantially similar municipal ordinance, the

from the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar
shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration
of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

698.02(f) or Ohio R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars
($5,000.00) for any economic loss arising from an accident or collision that

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the

violation of division (b)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section is guilty of
driving under suspension and shall be punished as provided in division (b)(3)A.

restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver's
or commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver's or commercial driver's license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver's or commercial driver's
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

pursuant to
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up
to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community
service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of
this section or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or a substantially

pleaded guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender's license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender's
driver license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range

with electronic monitoring under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on

offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.

state under R.C. Chapter 4734 that states the following:
         A.   That the person has a physical impairment that makes use of an
occupant restraining device impossible or impractical;
         B.   Whether the physical impairment is temporary, permanent, or
reasonably expected to be permanent;
         C.   If the physical impairment is temporary, how long the physical
impairment is expected to make the use of an occupant restraining device

      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(3) of this section do not apply to a
person who has registered with the Registrar of Motor Vehicles in accordance
with division (c)(5) of this section.
      (5)   A person who has received an affidavit under division (c)(3) of
this section stating that the person has a permanent or reasonably expected to
be permanent physical impairment that makes use of an occupant restraining
device impossible or impracticable may register with the Registrar of Motor
Vehicles attesting to that fact. Upon such registration, the Registrar shall
make that information available in the law enforcement automated data system. A
person included in the database under division (c)(5) of this section is not
required to have the affidavit obtained in accordance with division (c)(3) of
this section in their possession while operating or occupying an automobile.
      (6)   A physician or chiropractor who issues an affidavit for the
purposes of division (c)(3) or (c)(4) of this section is immune from civil
liability arising from any injury or death sustained by the person who was
issued the affidavit due to the failure of the person to wear an occupant

misconduct.
      (7)   The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall adopt rules in accordance
with R.C. Chapter 119 establishing a process for a person to be included in the

   (d)   Officers Not Permitted to Stop Cars to Determine Violation. Notwith-
standing any provision of law to the contrary, no law enforcement officer shall
cause an operator of an automobile being operated on any street or highway to
stop the automobile for the sole purpose of determining whether a violation of
division (b) of this section has been or is being committed or for the sole
purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or summons for the violation or for
causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for the
violation. No law enforcement officer shall view the interior or visually
inspect any automobile being operated on any street or highway for the sole
purpose of determining whether the violation has been or is being committed.
   (e)   Use of Fines for Educational Program. All fines collected for

      (1)   Subject to division (f)(2) of this section, the failure of a person
to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of division (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section or
the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates division (b)(2) of this section shall be subject
to the penalty set forth in Section
408.02.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
division (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates division (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

440.01   LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The Municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
Ohio R.C. 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the Municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         B.   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a
vehicle, are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules
establishing requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially
similar to the requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:
2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the Municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in Ohio R.C.
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)
   (c)   Local Streets. No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity
with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37, or exceeding a gross weight of five
tons, upon any street in the Municipality other than state routes and County
roads, except those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as
such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is necessary
to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of such
vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage
through the Municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a
state route or a designated truck route within the Municipality shall confine
such deviation to that required in order to accomplish the purpose of the
departure. On County roads, Council or other duly designated local authority
shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the construction and
material specifications for such roads and the load resistance of such roads as
determined by the County Engineer. County roads shall be posted with signs
indicating such weight limits.
   (d)   Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (1)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the
Police Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant
shall pay the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00).
      (4)   Except as provided in divisions (a) and (c) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating “no thru trucks -
gross weight 5 tons” or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit. Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections
408.01 and
408.02.

452.05   WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper,
upon notification to the chief of such action and of the location of the place
of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, including an abandoned
junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief
of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However, when such
a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be ordered into
storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief or state highway patrol trooper shall allow
the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the removal
of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief or state
highway patrol trooper. If the chief or state highway patrol trooper determines
that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of time, the
chief or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the chief shall designate
the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
division (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle by
a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity of
the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the presentation, shall issue a salvage
certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief of
a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation of the reason for leaving
the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and Ohio R.C. 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property, or private property within the
Municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing
of such abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
Municipality from such disposal.
(R.C. § 4513.64)
452.055   PARKING PROHIBITIONS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY; PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation, upon complaint of any person adversely affected, may order into
storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or private
agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the chief
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.

private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than
three separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. The
phrase does not include any private property on which is located one or more
structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by two or more
persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in the structure
or structures.
   (b)   (1)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been
ordered into storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section arrives after
the motor vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual
removal from the property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator
oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that the chief orders
into storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section. The record shall
include an entry for each such motor vehicle that identifies the motor
vehicle’s license number, make, model, and color, the location from which it
was removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the
person from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it
has been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under division (a)
(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both of
the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 or, if the vehicle
was towed within a municipal corporation that has established fees for vehicle
removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees established by the
municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.

(d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into

under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor

         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor
vehicle from any private residential or private agricultural property other
than in accordance with division (a)(1) of this section or R.C. §§ 4513.61 to

      (2)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with the
requirements of this section.
   (f)   This section does not apply to any private residential or private
agricultural property that is established as a private tow-away zone in
accordance with division (h) of this section or R.C. § 4513.601.
   (g)   Whoever violates division (e) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 4513.60)
   (h)   Private tow-away zones.
      (1)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away
zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         A.   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
            2.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.
If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow- away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
            3.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times,
the times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
            4.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
            5.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in R.C. § 4505.101(B).
            6.   In order to comply with the requirements of division (h)(1)A.
of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the
sign.
         B.   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this division
(h) is taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with
all of the following:
            1.   It is located within 25 linear miles of the location of the
private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to a
place of storage within 25 linear miles.
            2.   It is well-lighted.
            3.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly
scheduled route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public
transportation is available in the municipal corporation or township in which
the private tow-away zone is located.
      (2)   A.   If a vehicle is parked on private property that is established
as a private tow-away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this division (h). The vehicle owner and
the operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains
unclaimed as provided in R.C. § 4505.101. The owner or lienholder of a vehicle
that has been removed under this division (h), subject to division (h)(3) of
this section, may recover the vehicle in accordance with division (h)(7) of
this section.
         B.   If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck
operators to be licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to division (h)(2) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
         C.   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
      (3)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (h)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.
Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
      (4)   A.   Prior to towing a vehicle under division (h)(2) of this
section, a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many
photographs as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on
private property in violation of a private tow-away zone established under
division (h)(1) of this section. The towing service shall record the time and
date of the photographs taken under this division (h). The towing service shall
retain the photographs and the record of the time and date, in electronic or
printed form, for at least 30 days after the date on which the vehicle is
recovered by the owner or lienholder or at least two years after the date on
which the vehicle was towed, whichever is earlier.
         B   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under division (h)
(2) of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more
than two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone,
unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two
hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is
not within the power of the towing service.
      (5)   A.   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under division
(h)(2) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of removing the
vehicle, shall provide notice to the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation concerning all of the following:
            1.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model, and color;
            2.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
            3.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
            4.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may
be recovered;
            5.   The address of the place from which the vehicle may be
recovered.
         B.   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed from private
property in the chief’s jurisdiction that is established as a private tow-away
zone of which the chief has received notice under this division (h). The record
shall include all information submitted by the towing service. The chief shall
provide any information in the record that pertains to a particular vehicle to
a person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner, operator, or lienholder of the vehicle and requests information
pertaining to the vehicle.
      (6)   A.   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance
with this section, within three business days of the removal, the towing
service or storage facility from which the vehicle may be recovered shall cause
a search to be made of either of the following to ascertain the identity of the
owner and any lienholder of the vehicle:
            1.   The records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles;
            2.   The records of any vendor or vendors, approved by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles, that are capable of providing real-time access to
owner and lienholder information.
         B.   The towing service or storage facility may search the National
Motor Vehicle Title Information System in order to determine the state in which
the vehicle is titled. The entity that provides the record of the owner and any
lienholder under this division shall ensure that such information is provided
in a timely manner.
         C.   Subject to division (h)(6)F. of this section, the towing service
or storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
            1.   Within five business days after the applicable entity provides
the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if the
vehicle remains unclaimed, to the owner’s and lienholder’s last known address
by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by certified mail
with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service utilizing any form
of delivery requiring a signed receipt;
            2.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed 30 days after the first
notice is sent, in the manner required under division (h)(6)C.1. of this
section.
         D.   Sixty days after any notice sent pursuant to division (h)(6)C. of
this section is received, as evidenced by a receipt signed by any person, or
the towing service or storage facility has been notified that delivery was not
possible, the towing service or storage facility, if authorized under R.C. §
4505.101(B), may initiate the process for obtaining a certificate of title to
the motor vehicle as provided in that section.

signed receipt of notice, or a notification that delivery was not possible,

the motor vehicle under R.C. § 4505.101(B).
         F.   With respect to a vehicle concerning which a towing service or
storage facility is not eligible to obtain title under R.C. § 4505.101, the
towing service or storage facility need only comply with the initial notice
required under division (h)(6)C.1. of this section.
      (7)   A.   The owner or lienholder of a vehicle that is removed under
division (h)(2) of this section may reclaim it upon both of the following:

under R.C. § 4513.611.

by a certificate of title to the vehicle, a certificate of registration for the
motor vehicle, or a lease agreement, the owner of a vehicle that is removed
under authority of division (h)(2) of this section may retrieve any personal
items from the vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any

cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to

conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.

due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to

   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in

(R.C. § 2901.13)
606.07   REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language section
defining the offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.” Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.” Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.” Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.” A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08   ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.

following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board's or person's office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.09   PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
606.10   FALSIFICATION.

commission of a theft offense.
      (10)   The statement is knowingly made to a probate court in connection

      (11)   The statement is made on an account, form, record, stamp, label or
other writing that is required by law.
      (12)   The statement is made in connection with the purchase of a
firearm, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2923.11, and in conjunction with the

whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.

an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a

commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).

prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.

   (k)   Hearing.
      (1)   The municipal court or Mayor’s court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
(Ord. 14-022. Passed 8-18-14.)
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, Ohio R.C. 955.11
(D) and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and
the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog,
and Section
618.18 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and
“vicious dog” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 955.11.

accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

under any provision of law, the court imposing sentence upon an offender who is
convicted of or pleads guilty to a drug abuse offense may order the offender to

628.08   COMPLAINTS; INVESTIGATIONS; CONCILIATION; ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Any person subjected to an unlawful housing practice may file, within
360 days of the alleged violation, with the Fair Housing Board, a complaint, in
writing, sworn to or affirmed, which complaint shall state the name and address
of the person alleged to have committed the violation complained of, the
particulars thereof and such other information as may be required by the Board.
The Board may also corroborate or initiate complaints on the basis of testing
carried out by its staff or by volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (b)   Upon the filing of a complaint, the executive secretary of the Board
shall make such investigation as he or she deems appropriate to ascertain facts
and issues. If the executive secretary determines that there are reasonable
grounds to believe that a violation has occurred, he or she shall attempt to
conciliate the matter by the methods of an initial conference and persuasion
with all interested parties and such representatives as the parties may choose
to assist them. Conciliation conferences shall be informal and nothing that is
said or done during such initial conferences shall be made public by the Board,
by any member thereof or by its staff unless the parties agree thereto in
writing.
   (c)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to
writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties,
which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not constitute an
admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent agreements shall
be signed on behalf of the Board by its Chairperson.
   (d)   The Board is hereby authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the
Ohio Real Estate Board or Ohio Civil Rights Commission in any investigation
under this chapter.
   (e)   If the executive secretary determines that the complaint lacks
reasonable grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he or she
shall so inform the Board, and the Board may, in its discretion, dismiss such
complaint or order such further investigation as may be necessary. However, the
Board shall not dismiss such complaint without first affording the complainant
an opportunity to appear before the Board.
   (f)   If the executive secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a
violation of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties
have in good faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal
conciliation agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a
complaint is not susceptible to conciliation, he or she shall notify the Board
immediately. The Board shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine
whether or not a violation of this chapter has been committed. The Board shall
serve upon the respondent a statement of charges and a summons and shall serve
upon all interested parties a notice of the time and place of the hearing. The
respondent or his or her authorized counsel may file such statements with the
Board prior to the hearing date as he or she deems necessary in support of his
or her position. The hearing shall be open to the public, except that the
respondent may request, in writing, a private hearing, and the determination of
such request shall be discretionary with the Board. The hearing shall be held
not less than 15 days after service of the statement of charges and summons.
The summons so issued must be signed by two members of the Board, and the
issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of named persons and the
production of relevant documents and records. Failure to comply with a summons
shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The interested parties may, at
their option, appear before the Board in person or by duly authorized
representative and may have the assistance of an attorney. The parties may
present testimony and evidence and the right to cross-examine witnesses shall
be preserved. All testimony and evidence shall be given under oath or by
affirmation. The executive secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing,
which record shall be public and open to inspection by any person. Upon request
by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such party a
copy of the hearing record, if any, at such cost as the Board deems
appropriate.
   (g)   If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board determines, upon the
preponderance of the evidence, that the person complained against has violated
this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Law Director in
executive session, state its findings to and cause the Law Director to prepare
and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person complained
against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take such
affirmative action as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter. Such order
shall contain notice that if the Board determines that the person complained
against has not, after 15 calendar days following service of the Board's order,
complied with the order, the Board will recertify the matter to the Law
Director for enforcement.
   (h)   Upon recertification to the Law Director for enforcement, he or she
shall seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the
Board before a court of competent jurisdiction. In any such proceeding, where
the court determines that there has been a violation of this chapter, the court
shall award compensatory damages and, where appropriate, punitive damages,
along with attorney fees. The court may also order such other relief as it
deems necessary or appropriate.
   (i)   If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board determines, upon the
preponderance of the evidence of the record, that the person complained against
has not violated this chapter, the Board shall state and publish its findings
and issue its order dismissing the complaint.

violation of this section and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of R.C. § 2903.13, or any substantially similar municipal ordinance,
based on the same conduct involving the same victim that was the basis of the

offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an

value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series

substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),

than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,

violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether

more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered

for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.

under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, “fair

would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all

value of property or services involved in a theft offense:

wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.

value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort, or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.

in Ohio R.C. 2913.61.

independent of any other section or subsection or any order issued pursuant to
this chapter. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or

the width of the parcel.
   (c)   Removal of Trees, Weeds, Grasses by Village. In the event the owner

      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty, or brutality.
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

purpose.

activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

698.01   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Dangerous offender” means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   “Repeat offender” means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or
more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent felony drug
abuse offense;
      (5)   Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or
degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offenses, or minor
misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02   PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.

offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.

698.03 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this

over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court's consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court's
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the

      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C.  307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the

Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division

any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five- year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
   (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for a
significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.

intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender' occupation or care
for the offender' family;

seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the

travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including
but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, and other contagious diseases. The
person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who
refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, or another contagious
disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.

the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the

   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:

thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to
be credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. §
111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the State or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender's criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, State, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(4) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
      (10)   If an offender is sentenced to pay restitution, a fine, fee, or
incarceration costs, the clerk of the sentencing court, on request, shall make
the offender’s payment history available to the victim, victim’s
representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, the prosecutor, the probation
department, and the court without cost.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
698.03   IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
      (3)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with divisions (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the court
may consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. §§ 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(R.C. § 2929.22)
698.04   ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand
dollars ($3,000.00);
      (4)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two thousand
dollars ($2,000.00);
      (5)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05   MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(ORC 2929.41)
698.06   MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE. (REPEALED)
   ( Editor's note: Section
698.06 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating and revision of this code of
ordinances because substantially equivalent State law (Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was
repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
698.07   SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially equivalent.

refusing to issue or revoking such license and/or after seizure. Council shall
fix a time for the hearing of such appeal, at which hearing any parties
interested shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard. Council shall then
determine whether to affirm, reverse or modify, in whole or in part, such order
from which the appeal has been perfected.
(Ord. 82-031. Passed 10-5-82.)

880.02   IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)   To provide funds for the purposes of general Municipal operations,
maintenance of equipment, new equipment, extension, enlargement and improvement
of Municipal services and facilities and capital improvements of the
Municipality, there is hereby levied a tax upon earnings at the rate of one and
one-half percent upon the following:
      (1)   On all salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned
on and after July 1, 1991, by resident individuals of the Municipality;
      (2)   On all salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned
on and after July 1, 1991, by nonresident individuals, for work done or
services performed or rendered in the Municipality;
      (3)   On the net profits attributable to the Municipality earned on and
after July 1, 1991, of all resident unincorporated businesses, professions and
other activities, derived from work done or services rendered or performed and
business or other activities conducted in the Municipality;
      (4)   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits earned
on and after July 1, 1991, of a resident individual, partner or owner of a
resident unincorporated business entity attributable to the Municipality and
not levied against such unincorporated business entity;
      (5)   On the net profits attributable to the Municipality earned on and
after July 1, 1991, of all nonresident unincorporated businesses, professions
or other activities, derived from work done or services rendered or performed
and business or other activities conducted in the Municipality;
      (6)   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits earned

      (7)   On the net profits earned on and after July 1, 1991, of all
corporations, derived from work done or services rendered or performed and
business or other activities conducted in the Municipality.
   (b)   The portion of the net profits attributable to the Municipality of a
taxpayer conducting a business, profession or other activity, both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality, shall be determined as provided in
Section
880.03 and in accordance with the regulations adopted by Council and codified

(Ord. 781. Passed 12-8-70; Res. 91-954. Passed 2-19-91.)
880.03   DETERMINATION OF INCOME SUBJECT TO TAX.
   (a)   In the taxation of income which is subject to taxation under this
chapter, if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or
profession both within and without the boundaries of the Municipality disclose
with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit is attributable to that
part of the business or profession conducted within the boundaries of the
Municipality, then only such portion shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the Municipality for purposes of income taxation. In the absence of
such records, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within
and without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of:
      (1)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Municipality during the taxable period, to the average net book value of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used in
this paragraph, "real property" includes property rented or leased by the
taxpayer. The value for such property shall be determined by multiplying the
annual rental thereon by eight.
      (2)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Municipality, to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the
same period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed; and
      (3)   The gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made
and services performed during the taxable period in the Municipality, to gross
receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales and
services, wherever made or performed.
   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
so as to produce such result.
   (b)   As used in this section, "sales made in the Municipality" means:
      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Municipality, regardless of where title passes, if shipped or delivered
from a stock of goods within the Municipality;
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Municipality, regardless of where title passes, even though transported
from a point outside the Municipality, if the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
Municipality and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion; and
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the Municipality to purchasers outside the Municipality,
regardless of where title passes, if the taxpayer is not, through its own
employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the
place where delivery is made.
(Ord. 781. Passed 12-8-70.)
880.04   EFFECTIVE PERIOD.

respect to salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned on and
after July 1, 1991, and with respect to the net profit of businesses,
professions and other activities earned on and after July 1, 1991, provided,
however, that where the fiscal year of the business, profession or other
activity differs from the calendar year, the tax shall be applied to that part
of the net profit for the fiscal year as is earned on and after July 1, 1991,
to the close of the taxpayer's fiscal year. Thereafter, the taxpayer shall
report on its fiscal year basis.

(Res. 580. Passed 12-8-70; Ord. 11-076. Passed 12-27-11.)
880.18   COMMENCEMENT AND DURATION OF TAX.
   (a)   The tax imposed by the Ordinance is effective as to income and profits
earned or accruing on and after July 1, 1991, and payroll deductions must be
made against all salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses and other compensation
earned or accruing on and after that date. (Adopting Ordinance)
   (b)   The Ordinance shall continue effective insofar as the levy of taxes is
concerned until further action of Council and/or a vote of the people repealing
or amending the same.
(Ord. 00-025. Passed 8-1-00.)
880.19   IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)   Resident Employees. In the case of the residents of the Municipality,
an annual tax of one and one-half percent is imposed on all salaries, wages,
commissions and other compensation, including employer-paid sick pay,
supplemental unemployment benefits, employer-paid life insurance premiums and
profit-sharing distributions, which shall also be considered regular earned
income on all tax returns in the Municipality, earned or accrued on and after
July 1, 1991. For the purpose of determining the tax on the earnings of
resident taxpayers, taxed under Section
880.02(a)(1), the source of the earnings and the place or places in or at which
the services were rendered are immaterial. All such earnings, wherever earned
or paid, are taxable.
   The following are items which are subject to the tax:
      (1)   Salaries, wages, bonuses or incentive payments received by an
individual, whether directly or through an agent and whether in cash or in
property, for services rendered on and after July 1, 1991:
         A.   As an officer, director or employee of a corporation (including
charitable and other non-profit corporations), joint stock association or joint
stock company;
         B.   As an employee (as distinguished from a partner or member) of a
partnership, limited partnership, or any other form of unincorporated
enterprise owned by one or more persons;
         C.   As an employee (as distinguished from the proprietor) of a
business, trade or profession conducted by an individual owner;
         D.   As an officer or employee (whether elected, appointed or
commissioned) of a governmental administration, agency, arm, authority, board,
body, branch, bureau, department, division, subdivision, section or unit of the
State of Ohio or any of the political subdivisions thereof;
         E.   As an officer or employee (whether elected, appointed or
commissioned) of a governmental administration, agency, arm, authority, board,
body, branch, bureau, department, division, subdivision, section or unit of the
United States Government or of a corporation created and owned, or controlled
by the United States Government or any of its agencies;
         F.   As an employee of any other entity or person.
      (2)   Wages, bonuses, or incentive payments received by an individual,
whether directly or through an agent and whether in cash or in property, for
services rendered on and after July 1, 1991:
         A.   Whether based upon hourly, daily, weekly, semi-monthly, monthly,
annual, unit of production or piece-work rates; and
         B.   Whether paid by an individual, limited partnership, partnership,
association, corporation (including charitable and other non-profit
corporations), governmental administration, agency, arm, authority, board,
body, branch, department, division, subdivision, section or unit, or any other
entity.
      (3)   Commissions received by a taxpayer, whether directly or through an
agent and whether in cash or in property, for services rendered on and after
July 1, 1991, regardless of how computed, by whom or wheresoever paid.
      If amounts received as a drawing account exceed the commissions earned,
the tax is payable on the gross amounts received.
      Amounts received from an employer by way of expenses and not by way of
compensation, and used as such by the individual receiving them, are not deemed
to be compensation if the employer deducts such expense advances as such from
his or her gross income for the purpose of determining his or her net profits
taxable under the Ordinance.
   If such commissions are included in the net earnings of a trade, business,
profession, enterprise or activity regularly carried on by such individual and
therefore subject to tax under Section
880.02(a)(3), they shall not again be separately taxed. In such case, such net
earnings shall be taxed as provided in subsection (i) hereof.
      (4)   The receipt of fees and other compensation for personal services
rendered shall be deemed to be subject to taxation under the Ordinance.
      (5)   Domestic servants are subject to Municipal tax under the Ordinance,
but are not subject to withholding provisions. That is to say, the domestic
will report earnings and pay the tax directly to the Grafton Income Tax
Department.
   (b)   Nonresidents. In the case of individuals who are nonresidents of the
Municipality, there is imposed under the Ordinance an annual tax of one and
one-half percent on all salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation,
earned or accruing on and after July 1, 1991, for work done or services
performed or rendered within the Municipality, whether such compensation or
remuneration is received or earned directly or through an agent and whether
paid in cash or in property.
   The items subject to tax under this section are the same as those listed and
defined in subsection (a) hereof. For methods of computing the extent of such
work or services performed within the Municipality, and cases involving
compensation for personal services partly within and partly outside the
Municipality, see Section
880.21.
   (c)   Net Business Profits of Residents.
      (1)   In the case of trades, businesses, professions, other activities,
enterprises or undertakings conducted, operated, engaged in, prosecuted or
carried on by residents of the Municipality, there is imposed an annual tax of
one and one-half percent on the net profits earned or accruing on and after
July 1, 1991.
      (2)   For the purpose of construing Section
880.02(a)(3) and (4), the term "resident" will ordinarily be construed to have
reference to the business entity itself, as distinguished from the partners,
proprietors or other participants in its profits.
      (3)   Generally, a partnership, association or other unincorporated
enterprise owned by two or more persons will be taxed as an entity. However, in
the case of a nonresident partnership, association or unincorporated enterprise
which cannot be reached or taxed directly by the Municipality, or if only part
of its earnings may be directly taxed, then in either such case, resident
partners, co-owners, proprietors or other participants in the profits thereof
must include in their declaration and tax return or returns their distributive
shares of such profits, or portion thereof not taxed to the business enterprise
as an entity, and must pay the tax thereon.
      (4)   The tax imposed under Section
880.02(a)(3) is levied upon the entire net profits of the resident trade,
business, profession, other activity, enterprise, or undertaking, wherever
earned, paid or accrued and regardless of the fact that any part of such
business or professional activity may have been conducted at or through a place
or places of business located outside the Municipality.
   (d)   Net Business Profits of Nonresidents.
      (1)   In the case of a nonresident individual, partnership, association,
fiduciary or other entity (other than a corporation) engaged in the conduct,
operation or prosecution of any trade, business, profession, enterprise,
undertaking or other activity, there is imposed an annual tax of one and one-
half percent on the net profits (earned or accruing on and after July 1, 1991)
of such trade, business, profession, enterprise, undertaking, or other activity
if, and to the extent, conducted in or derived from activity in the
Municipality.
      (2)   A nonresident entity, within the meaning of Section
880.02(a)(5) which has a branch or branches, office or offices and/or store or
stores, warehouse, or other place or places in which the entity's business is
transacted, located in the Municipality, shall be considered to be conducting,
operating, prosecuting, or carrying on a trade, business, profession,
enterprise, undertaking or other activity to the full extent of the sum total
of all transactions originating or consummated in, by or through such Municipal
branch, office, store, warehouse or other place of business, including: A.
billings made on such transactions, B. services rendered, C. shipments made, D.
goods, chattels, merchandise, etc., sold, or E. commissions, fees or other
remuneration or payments earned.
      (3)   In the case of the partnership, association, or other
unincorporated business owned by one or more persons the tax, generally, shall
be upon said partnership, association, or business enterprise as an entity and
not ordinarily upon the partners or members thereof. However, the provisions of
subsection (c) hereof are applicable to render taxable against such resident
partners or members their distributive share of any profits of such nonresident
entity not taxable under the Ordinance.
   (4)   In determining the proportion or amount of the taxable net profits of
a nonresident business entity having a place or places of business within and
outside the Municipality, such business entity may at its option use and apply
the business allocation percentage formula referred to in Section
880.02(b) and as set forth in detail in subsection (f) hereof.
   (e)   Net Business Profits of Corporations.
      (1)   In the case of a corporation doing business in the Municipality,
whether domestic or foreign, and whether domiciled in the Municipality or
elsewhere, there is imposed an annual tax of one and one-half percent on that
part of the net profits (earned or accruing on and after July 1, 1991) of such
corporation which is earned by such corporation as a result of work done or
services performed or rendered and business or other activities conducted in
the Municipality.
      (2)   The provisions of paragraph (d)(2) hereof are applicable to such
corporations.
      (3)   A corporation doing business both within and outside the
Municipality may, in determining the part of the net profits which are taxable
under Sections
880.01 et seq., at its option:
         A.   Use the usual accounting system of the taxpayer corporation, so
long as said usual accounting system shall be one acceptable to the Federal
Internal Revenue Department as evidenced by acceptance and approval of income
tax returns filed therein; or
         B.   Use the business allocation percentage formula set forth in
Section
880.02(b).
   (f)   Business Allocation Percentage.
      (1)   Generally. At the option of a corporate taxpayer or of a
nonresident business entity, such taxpayers may, but are not obliged to, use
the formula set forth in Section
880.02(b) to compute the percentage of their entire net profits (derived from
activities both within and outside the Municipality) which is taxable under the
Ordinance, and to determine the tax payable to the Municipality hereunder.
   If the taxpayer did not have a place of business outside the Municipality
during the period covered by any declaration and/or return required under the
Ordinance, its business allocation percentage is 100 percent; in other words,
the taxpayer is required to pay a tax of one and one-half percent on the entire
net profits of the business.
   If the taxpayer had a place or places of business outside the Municipality
and was doing business in the Municipality during such period, the business
allocation percentage shall be computed on the basis as set forth in Section
880.02(b).
   The business allocation percentage is computed by determining the
percentages A. which Municipal real and tangible personal property bears to all
real and tangible personal property (including that situated in the
Municipality) of a taxpayer wheresoever situated; B. which Grafton business
sales bear to a taxpayer's entire business sales wheresoever derived (including
those derived from the Municipality); and C. which payrolls paid by a taxpayer
within the Municipality bear to a taxpayer's entire payroll wheresoever paid
(including Municipal payrolls); adding together the three percentages so
arrived at, and dividing the total by three.
   However, if one of the factors (property, sales or payrolls) is missing, the
other two percentages are added and the sum is divided by two, and if two of
the factors are missing, the remaining percentage is the business allocation
percentage.
EXAMPLE 1:
      Corporation having places of business in Grafton, Detroit and Cleveland.
      Grafton real and tangible personal property: $10,000.
      All real and personal property (Grafton, Detroit and Cleveland):
$100,000.
Percentage: 10%.
      Grafton sales: $15,000. All sales: $75,000. Percentage: 20%.
      Grafton payroll: $6,000. All payroll: $20,000. Percentage: 30%.
Business Allocation Percentage: 10% plus 20% plus 30% divided by 3 equals 20%
      EXAMPLE 2:
      Same corporation owning no real or tangible personal property anywhere.
      Grafton sales: $15,000. All sales: $75,000. Percentage: 20%.
      Grafton payroll: $6,000. All payroll: $20,000. Percentage: 30%.
Business Allocation Percentage: 20% plus 30% divided by 2 equals 25%.
      EXAMPLE 3:
Same corporation owning real and tangible personal property in Grafton valued
at $10,000 and owning no real or tangible personal property outside Grafton.
Other factors same as in Examples 1 and 2.
Business Allocation Percentage: 100% plus 20% plus 30% divided by 3 equals 50%.
   After determining such business allocation percentage, the tax shall be
determined by applying that percentage to the entire net profits of the
taxpayer, wherever derived (thus arriving at the taxable net profit), and
computing one and one-half percent of the resultant taxable net profit.
   In case it shall appear to the Clerk-Treasurer that any income or capital of
the taxpayer is improperly or inaccurately reflected, the Clerk- Treasurer may
adjust items of income, expenses, deductions and capital, and disregard assets
in computing any allocation percentage, provided that any income directly
traceable thereto is also excluded from entire net income, so as equitably to
determine the tax.
      (2)   Explanation of "property factor". The percentage of the taxpayer's
real and tangible personal property within the Municipality is determined by
dividing the net book value (during the period covered by the report) of such
property within the Municipality, without deduction of any encumbrances, by the
average net book value similarly computed, of all such property within and
without the Municipality. Only property owned by the taxpayer is considered in
determining such percentage.
      (3)   Explanation of sales factor. Receipts from the following are
allocable to the Municipality:
         A.   Work done and performed or services rendered in the Municipality.
         B.   Rentals from property situated in the Municipality, where the
rental of such property is a usual or normal part of the taxpayer's business
activity.
         C.   For the purpose of determining business allocation percentage, no
account shall be given to receipts, within or without the Municipality, of
income derived from intangibles (including stocks, bonds, royalties and the
like) the income of which is taxable under the statutes of the State of Ohio.
         D.   Compensation and other receipts for work done or services
performed within the Municipality are allocable to the Municipality and taxable
under the Ordinance. All amounts so received, credited or charged by taxpayer
in payment for such work or services are so allocable, irrespective of whether
done or performed by employees or agents of the taxpayer or by any other
person. It is immaterial where such amounts were payable or where they were
received.
         Commissions or fees received by the taxpayer are allocated to the
Municipality if the services for which the commissions were paid were performed
in the Municipality. If the taxpayer's services for which commissions or fees
were paid were performed for the taxpayer by salesmen or other agents or
employees attached to or working out of a Grafton place of business of the
taxpayer, the taxpayer's services will be deemed to have been performed in the
Municipality.
   Where a lump sum is received by the taxpayer in payment for services within
and without the Municipality, the amount attributable to services within
Municipality is to be determined on the basis of the relative values of, or
amounts of time spent in the performance of, such services within and without
the Municipality.
         E.   Receipts from the sale of capital assets (property not held by
the taxpayer for sale to customers in the regular course of business) are not
business receipts. Receipts from the sale of real property held by the taxpayer
as a dealer for sale to customers in the regular course of business are
business receipts and are allocable to the Municipality if the real property
was situated in the Municipality. Receipts from the sale of intangibles
included in business capital, held by the taxpayer as a dealer for sale to
customers in the regular course of business, are business receipts and are
allocable to the Municipality if the sales were made in Municipality or through
a regular place of business of the taxpayer in the Municipality.
      (4)   Payroll factor. The percentage of the taxpayer's payroll allocable
to the Municipality is determined by dividing the wages, salaries and other
personal service compensation of the taxpayers' employees within the
Municipality during the period covered by the report, by the total amount of
compensation of all taxpayer's employees during such period.
      Wages, salaries and other compensation are computed on the cash or
accrual basis in accordance with the method of accounting used in the
computation of the entire net income of the taxpayer.
      Employees within the Municipality usually include all employees regularly
connected with or working out of a place of business maintained by the taxpayer
in the Municipality.
However, where an employee performed services both within and without the
Municipality, the amount treated as compensation for services performed within
the Municipality shall be deemed to be A. in the case of an employee whose
compensation depends directly on the volume of business secured by him, such as
a salesman on a commission basis, the amount received by him for the business
attributable to his efforts within the Municipality; B. in the case of an
employee whose compensation depends on other results achieved, the proportion
of the total compensation which the value of his services within the
Municipality bears to the value of all his services; and C. in the case of an
employee compensated on a time basis, the proportion of the total amount
received by him which the working time employed in the Municipality bears to
the total working time.
      (5)   Adjustment of business allocation percentage formula. Generally,
the business allocation percentage formula will result in a fair apportionment
of the taxpayer's net profits within and without the Municipality. However, due
to the peculiar circumstances of certain businesses, the formula may work a
hardship in some cases or result in a tax evasion in others, thus not do
justice to the taxpayer or the Municipality. Accordingly, in such cases, the
Clerk-Treasurer may substitute factors calculated to bring about a fair and
proper allocation in any case where the taxpayer has adopted the optional use
of the business allocation percentage formula.
   (g)   Effective Dates.
      (1)   The tax referred to in subsections (a) and (b) hereof shall first
be levied, collected and paid with respect to the salaries, wages, bonuses,
incentive payments, commissions, fees and/or other compensation earned on and
after July 1, 1991.
      (2)   The tax referred to in subsections (c), (d) and (e) hereof, with
respect to net profits of trades, businesses, professions, enterprises,
undertakings, and other activities, shall first be levied, collected and paid
with respect to such net profits earned or accrued (in accordance with the
regular accounting system of a taxpayer as approved by the Director of Internal
Revenue) from and after July 1, 1991.
      (3)   See subsection (h) hereof for provisions relating to fiscal year
returns.
   (h)   Fiscal Years. Where the fiscal year of a trade, business, profession,
enterprise, undertaking and/or other activity differs from the calendar year,
the tax shall be applicable to the net profits of the fiscal year, but for the
first fiscal year with respect only to such portion thereof as was earned on
and after July 1, 1991.
   A fiscal year will be recognized only if it has been or may be recognized as
such by the Director of Internal Revenue for the purpose of Federal Income Tax.
   (i)   Net Business Profits Generally. In amplification of the definition of
the term "net profits," as set forth in Section
880.01, but not in limitation thereof, the following additional information and
requirements respecting net business profits are furnished:
      (1)   Where necessary to properly reflect income, inventories must be
used. The basis of pricing used for the purpose of the Federal Income Tax must
in each instance be used.
      (2)   Where the books and records are kept on an "accrual basis", "long-
term contract basis", or "installment basis", and said basis is used in the
filing of Federal Income Tax Returns, the same basis must be used for the
purpose of this tax.
      (3)   If the return is made on a "cash basis", gross profit shall include
A. commissions, fees and interest earned, plus B. the gross profit or loss from
sales of merchandise, chattels, goods, wares, securities, notes, choses-in-
action and services, except as hereinafter provided.
      (4)   If the return is made on an "accrual basis", gross profit shall
include A. commissions, fees and interest earned, plus B. the gross profit or
loss from sales of merchandise, chattels, goods, wares, securities, notes,
choses-in-action and services, except as hereinafter provided.
      (5)   From gross profit there shall be subtracted allowable expenses to
arrive at the net profits subject to the tax.
      (6)   All ordinary and necessary expenses of doing business, including
reasonable compensation paid to employees, shall be allowed (but no deduction
may be claimed for "salary" or withdrawals of a proprietor or of the partners,
members or other co-owners of an unincorporated business or enterprise).
      (7)   If not claimed as part of the cost of goods sold or elsewhere in
the return filed, there may be claimed and allowed a reasonable deduction for
depreciation, depletion, obsolescence, losses resulting from theft or casualty
not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, of property used in the trade or
business, but the amount may not exceed that recognized for the purpose of the
Federal Income Tax.
      (8)   Bad debts in a reasonable amount may be allowed in the year
ascertained worthless and charged off, but in no event shall the amount allowed
exceed the amount recognized as a deduction for the purpose of the Federal
Income Tax.
      (9)   Only taxes directly connected with the taxpayer's business may be
claimed as a deduction. If for any reason the income from property is not
subject to tax, then the tax on any other expenses of said property are not
deductible. In any event, the following taxes are not deductible from income:
         A.   The tax under the Ordinance;
         B.   Any Federal taxes based upon income;
         C.   Gifts, estate or inheritance taxes; and
         D.   Taxes and/or special assessments for local benefits or
improvements to property which tend to appreciate the value thereof.
      (10)   Capital gains and losses (including gains or losses from the sale,
exchange, or other disposition of depreciable business property, and real
property used in the taxpayer's trade or business) shall not be taken into
consideration in arriving at net profits earned.
      (11)   If the taxpayer is a non-resident, only the amount of net profits
applicable to the activities of the business in the Municipality shall be
subjected to tax. If the nonresident taxpayer's records do not disclose the
actual net profits for the Municipal branch, office, store, or activity,
separately, then the basis of allocation shall be disclosed in the return. If
such basis of allocation is not deemed correct, in view of all the known
circumstances, the Clerk-Treasurer will make a reallocation based upon gross
receipts or any other basis which shall, under the circumstances of the case,
more accurately reflect the net profits.
      (12)   In general, all business expenses recognized and to the extent
allowed as such for the purpose of determining Federal Income Tax will be
recognized and allowed for determining the Municipal income tax under the
provisions of this chapter. However, all expenses connected with the
acquisition or carrying of securities, the income from which is not recognized
as taxable under this chapter, may not be deducted in determining taxable net
profits hereunder.
      (13)   In general, unearned income is not to be included in computing the
tax levied hereunder. Income from intangibles by way of dividends, interest and
the like, should not be included if the property from which such income is
derived is subject to taxation under the Intangible Personal Property Tax Laws
of the State of Ohio, or is specifically exempted from taxation under said
laws.
      (14)   Rentals received by the taxpayer are to be included only if and to
the extent that the rental, ownership, management or operation of the real
estate from which such rentals are derived (whether so rented, managed or
operated by the taxpayer individually or through agents or other
representatives) constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole or in
part.
   Following are the circumstances under which, in any instance, the rental of
any real property shall or shall not be deemed to be a "business activity":
         A.   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties,
regardless of number and value, aggregates in excess of one hundred dollars
($100) per month, it shall be prima facie evidence that the rental, ownership,
management or operation of such properties is a business activity of such
taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to tax;
provided that in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or
fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds one hundred dollars ($100) per
month; provided further that in the case of farm property, the owner shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when he shares in the crops or when
the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts derived from
the farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds one hundred dollars ($100)
per month; and provided further that the person who operates a rooming house
shall be considered in business whether or not the gross income exceeds one
hundred dollars ($100) per month.
         B.   In determining the amount of gross monthly rental of any real
property, periods during which (by reason of vacancy or any other cause)
rentals are not received shall not be taken into consideration by the taxpayer.
         C.   Rentals received by a taxpayer engaged in the business of buying
and selling real estate shall be considered as part of business income.
         D.   Real property, as the term is used in these Regulations, shall
include commercial property, residential property, farm property, and any and
all other types of real estate.
         E.   In determining the taxable net income from rentals, the
deductible expenses shall be of the same nature, extent and amount as are
allowed by the Internal Revenue Department for Federal Income Tax purposes.
         F.   Residents of the Municipality are subject to taxation upon net
income from rentals (to the extent above specified) on all properties located
in the Municipality, and on all properties located outside the Municipality,
the net income of which is not subject to municipal income tax in said other
community. In the case of residents of the Municipality, if the net income of
properties located outside the Municipality is subject to municipal income tax
in another community, then said net income will not be subject to the Municipal
income tax in Grafton.
   Nonresidents of the Municipality are subject to such taxation only if the
real property is situated within the Municipality. Nonresidents, in determining
whether gross monthly rentals exceed one hundred dollars ($100), shall take
into consideration only real estate situated within the Municipality.
      (15)   Income from royalties or copyrights is not to be included.
   (j)   Reconciliation With Federal Return. In a form satisfactory to the
Clerk- Treasurer, there shall be submitted with each return filed by a taxpayer
subject to the Federal Income Tax, a reconciliation between the amount shown in
the return filed with the Clerk-Treasurer and the business income reported to
the Federal Internal Revenue Department.
   If, as a result of a change made in business income by the Federal Internal
Revenue Department, or by a judicial decision, an additional amount will result
as owing to the Municipality, a report of such change shall be filed by the
taxpayer within thirty days after receipt of the final notice of such change
from the Federal authorities or after final decision of a court adjudicating
any such Federal Income Tax liability.
(Res. 580. Passed 12-8-70; Ord. 86-081. Passed 11-18-86; Ord. 00-024. Passed 8-
1-00; Ord. 00-025. Passed 8-1-00.)
880.20   RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   On or before April 15 of each calendar year, for taxable years
beginning after 2003, every taxpayer engaged in any business, the net profits
of which are subject in whole or in part to the tax imposed by this chapter,
shall make and file with the Clerk-Treasurer a final return on a form furnished
by or obtainable from the Clerk- Treasurer. All resident taxpayers, eighteen
years of age or older, that are required to file a Federal Income Tax Return
must file a return with the Clerk-Treasurer on a form furnished by or
obtainable from the Clerk-Treasurer. Failure to file shall be punishable as
provided in this chapter. Senior citizen residents of the Municipality who are
not required to file a Federal Income Tax Return are exempt from filing a tax
return with the Municipality unless and until said resident experiences a
change of income status. However, where a nonresident employee's entire
earnings for the year are paid by an employer and the Municipal tax thereon has
in each instance been withheld and deducted by the employer from the gross
amount of the entire earnings of such employee-taxpayer, and where the employer
of such nonresident employee has filed a report or return in which such
employee's entire and only earnings are reported to the Clerk-Treasurer, and
where such nonresident employee has no taxable income other than such earnings,
it shall not be necessary for such nonresident employee to file a return for
any taxable year in which such conditions have prevailed.
   Any person who receives both compensation for services performed for an
employer, in whatsoever form, and in addition receives income from any business
activity or occupation not subject to withholding under this chapter, must file
a declaration and a final return.
   (b)   In all returns filed hereunder there shall be set forth the aggregate
amount of salaries, wages, bonuses, incentive payments, commissions, fees and
other compensation received and/or net profits earned (all as hereinbefore
defined) by and during the preceding year and subject to said tax, together
with such pertinent information as the Clerk-Treasurer may require.
   (c)   If the return is made for a fiscal year or for any period other than a
calendar year, the said return shall be made within four months from the end of
said fiscal year.
   (d)   The return shall also show the amount of the tax imposed by this
chapter on such earnings, or net profits, or both.
   (e)   The taxpayer making the return shall, at the time of filing thereof,
pay the Clerk-Treasurer the amount of tax shown to be due and unpaid by the
return. If, pursuant to the provisions of Section
880.26, the taxpayer has at the time of making such final return overpaid his
tax, such taxpayer shall show the amount of overpayment and may in said return
either (1) request a refund therefor, or (2) request that the amount thereof be
credited against the amount which will be required to be paid by taxpayer on
the next succeeding installment of tax which may become due.
   (f)    Where any portion of the tax otherwise due shall have been paid by
the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Sections
880.21 and
880.25, or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality, pursuant
to Section
880.16, credit for the amount so paid shall be deducted from the amount shown
to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of
filing said final return.
   (g)   Upon written request of the taxpayer, the Clerk-Treasurer may extend
the time for filing the annual return for a period of not more than six months
or not more than thirty days beyond any extension requested of and granted by
the Federal Internal Revenue Department for the filing of the Federal Income
Tax Return.
   (h)   For payments in installments, see Section
880.26.
(Res. 580. Passed 12-8-70; Ord. 825. Passed 8-7-73; Ord. 90-191. Passed 12-27-
90; Ord. 94-024. Passed 11-15-94; Ord. 03-026. Passed 11-4-03.)
880.21   COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   It is the duty of each employer (as hereinbefore defined) who employs
one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission, or other compensation basis,
to deduct from compensation paid to any employee subject to the Ordinance, the
tax of one and one-half percent of such salary, wage, bonus, incentive payment,
commission or other compensation due by said employer to said employee. The tax
shall be deducted by the employer from:
      (1)   All compensation paid to employees who are nonresidents of the
Municipality for services rendered, work performed, or other activities engaged
in to earn such compensation, within the Municipality; and
      (2)   From the gross amount of all salaries, wages, bonuses, incentive
payments, commissions or other form of compensation paid to employees who are
residents of the Municipality, regardless of the place where the services are
rendered.
   (b)   All employers who or which maintain an office or other place of
business in the Municipality are required to make the collections and
deductions specified in this section, regardless of the fact that the services
on account of which any particular deduction is required as to residents of the
Municipality were performed at a place of business of any such employer
situated outside the Municipality.
   (c)   The mere fact that the tax is not withheld will not relieve the
employee of the responsibility of filing a return and paying the tax on the
compensation received.
   (d)   Commissions and fees paid to professional persons, brokers, and others
who are independent contractors and not employees of the payer, are not subject
to withholding or collection of the tax at the source. Such taxpayers must in
all instances file returns and pay the tax pursuant to the provisions of
Section
880.02. (See also Section
880.19(c) and (d).)
   (e)   In the case of employees who are nonresidents of the Municipality, the
amount to be deducted is one and one-half percent of the compensation paid with
respect to personal services rendered in the Municipality.
   Where a nonresident receives compensation for personal services rendered or
performed partly within and partly outside the Municipality, the withholding
employer shall deduct, withhold and remit that portion of the compensation
which is earned within the Municipality in accordance with the following rules
of apportionment:
      (1)   If the nonresident is a salesperson, agent, or other employee whose
compensation on the basis of commissions depends directly on the volume of
business transacted by him or her, the deducting and withholding shall attach
to the portion of the entire compensation which the volume of business
transacted by the employee within the Municipality bears to the volume of
business transacted by him or her within and outside the Municipality.
      (2)   The deducting and withholding of personal service compensation of
all other employees (including officers of corporations) shall attach to the
portion of the personal service compensation of such employee which the total
number of working days employed within the Municipality bears to the total
number of working days employed within and outside the Municipality.
      (3)   If it is impossible to apportion the earnings as provided above,
because A. the peculiar nature of the service of the employee, or B. the
unusual basis of compensation, apportionment shall be made in accordance with
the facts and the tax deducted and withheld accordingly.
      (4)   The occasional entry into the Municipality of a nonresident
employee who performs the duties for which he or she is employed entirely
outside the Municipality, but enters the Municipality for the purpose of
reporting, receiving instructions, accounting, etc., incidental to his or her
duties outside the Municipality, shall not be deemed to take such employee out
of the class of those rendering their services entirely outside the
Municipality.
   (f)   An employer shall withhold the tax on the full amount of any advances
made to an employee on account of commissions (whether by way of drawing
account or otherwise, but see subsection (g) hereof) where such advances are in
excess of commissions earned.
   (g)   An employer required to withhold the tax on compensation paid to an
employee shall, in determining the amount on which the tax is to be withheld,
ignore any amount allowed and paid by the employer to the employee for expenses
necessarily and actually incurred by the employee in the actual performance of
his or her services, provided that such expenses must be of the kind and in the
amount recognized and allowed as a deductible expense for Federal Income Tax
purposes.
(Res. 580. Passed 12-8-70; Ord. 00-024. Passed 8-1-00.)
880.22   RETURNS OF TAX WITHHELD; PAYMENT.
   The deduction from salaries, wages and other compensation required to be
made by employers are to begin with compensation earned on and after July 1,
1991. The first return and payment required to be made on account of such
deductions shall be made, filed and paid to the Clerk-Treasurer between October
1, 1991, and October 31, 1991.
   Each employer within the Municipality who employs one or more persons on a
salary, wage, commission or other compensation basis shall deduct monthly, or
more often than monthly, and at the time of the payment of such salary, wage,
commission, or other compensation, the tax of one and one-half percent of
salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation due by the said employer to
the said employee and shall make a return and pay to the Clerk-Treasurer the
amount of taxes so deducted as follows:
   For the three months ending March 31, on or before April 30;
   For the three months ending June 30, on or before July 31;
   For the three months ending September 30, on or before October 31;
   For the three months ending December 31, on or before the following January

   The reporting periods referred to in the preceding paragraphs are elastic to
this extent: The employer will use the same quarterly accounting period for
reporting taxes withheld under the Grafton Income Tax Ordinance as is used in
reporting quarterly taxes withheld to the Federal Government.
   Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs, and beginning October 1, 2000,
employers who deduct the above outlined taxes from salaries, wages and other
compensation in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) or more per month
shall pay to the Clerk-Treasurer, before the last day of the following month,
the amount of taxes so deducted on a monthly basis beginning with the first
month the employer exceeds one hundred dollars ($100.00) in taxes withheld and
continuing on a monthly basis thereafter.
   Taxes not paid in accordance with this section shall be charged interest and
penalties as provided for in Section
880.13.
   Said return shall be on a form prescribed by and obtainable from the Clerk-
Treasurer and shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed therefor
by the Clerk-Treasurer.
   For adjustment of errors in returns of tax withheld by employers see Section
880.28.
(Res. 580. Passed 12-8-70; Ord. 00-024. Passed 8-1-00; Ord. 00-030. Passed 8-1-
00.)
880.23   LIMITATION ON CREDIT FOR TAX PAID AT SOURCE.
   The failure of any employer, residing either within or outside the
Municipality, to collect the tax and to make any return prescribed herein,
shall not relieve the employee from the payment of such tax in compliance with
these Regulations respecting the making of returns and the payment of taxes.
(Res. 580. Passed 12-8-70.)
880.24   STATUS AND LIABILITY OF EMPLOYERS.
   Every employer is deemed to be a trustee of the Municipality in collecting
and holding the tax required under the Ordinance to be withheld, and the funds
so collected by such withholding are deemed to be trust funds until the same is
paid to the Municipality.
   Every such employer required to deduct and withhold the tax at the source is
liable directly to the Municipality for the payment of such tax, whether
actually collected by such employer or not.
   Every manager is deemed to be a trustee of this Municipality in collecting
and holding the tax required under this Chapter to be withheld, and the funds
so collected by such withholding are deemed to be trust funds. Every manager is
liable directly to this Municipality for payment of such trust, whether
actually collected by such employer or not. Any tax deducted and withheld is to
be considered paid to this Municipality, whether or not the employer actually
remits the tax to this Municipality, for purposes of determining employee
payments or credit.
   All managers shall be personaly liable to the extent of the tax, interest
and penalty, jointly and severally, for failure to file the employer’s return
or to pay the employer’s tax, interest and penalty as required under this
Chapter.
   No change in structure by an employer, including a fundamental change,
discharges its managers from liability for the employees’ or manager’s failure
to remit funds held in trust, to file a tax return or to pay taxes.
(Res. 580. Passed 12-8-70; Ord. 11-076. Passed 12-27-11.)
880.25   DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   An employee whose entire wages, salaries, or other compensation for
any taxable year will be subjected to the withholding provisions under Section
880.21, whose tax will accordingly be withheld as to his or her entire earnings
for such year by his or her employer, and who during such taxable year expects
to derive no other compensation or other income which is subject to tax under
the Ordinance, need not file a declaration as provided in this section.
(Res. 580. Passed 12-8-70.)
   (b)   All other taxpayers (as defined in this chapter) subject to the taxes
imposed in Section
880.02, who anticipate any income or net profits not subject to total
withholding as provided in the preceding paragraph, and the anticipated amount
of taxes owed is at least $100.00, shall file with the Clerk-Treasurer a
declaration of his or her estimated tax as follows:
      (1)   On or before April 30 of every calendar year, file a declaration of
his or her estimated tax for the taxable period.
      (2)   Each such declaration shall contain a statement of the taxpayer's
estimated tax for the full taxable year in which such declaration is filed.
   (c)   Taxpayers who or which are permitted, pursuant to the provisions of
Section
880.19(h), to return and pay their tax upon a fiscal year basis, shall file
their first declaration by the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the first fiscal year and the subsequent declaration for each year
thereafter on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
beginning of each such fiscal year. Those taxpayers on a fiscal year basis
shall make estimated payments on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth
month and on or before the fifteenth day of the sixth, ninth and twelfth month
following the beginning of such fiscal year. The first installment, equal to at
least 22 ½% of the estimated tax, must accompany the declaration.  At least 90%
of the estimated tax due must be paid by the fifteenth day of the twelfth
month.
   (d)   The estimated tax for a calendar year taxpayer may be paid in full
with the filing of the declaration, or in equal installments on or before April
30, July 31, October 31, and January 31. At least 90% of the estimated tax due
can be paid by January 31. (Ord. 00-025. Passed 8-1-00; Ord. 07-008. Passed 6-
5-07.)
   (e)   The declarations so required shall be filed upon a form furnished by
or obtainable from the Clerk-Treasurer. Any taxpayer who has filed an estimate
for Federal Income Tax purposes may, in making the declaration required
hereunder, simply state therein that the figures therein contained are the same
figures used by the taxpayer in making the declaration of his or her estimate
for the Federal Income Tax. However, in addition to such statement, any such
taxpayer may, in such declaration, modify and adjust such declared income so as
to exclude therefrom income which is not subject to tax under this chapter.
   (f)   Any estimate filed hereunder may be amended by the filing of an
amended estimate at the time prescribed for the payment of any installment of
tax paid in accordance with Section
880.27. (Res. 580. Passed 12-8-70; Ord. 07-008. Passed 6-5-07.)
880.26   PAYMENT OF TAX IN INSTALLMENTS.
   (a)   Payment.
      (1)   Individual calendar year taxpayers. Individual taxpayers who return
and pay taxes on a calendar year basis, shall, at the time of filing each
declaration as required by Section
880.25, and continuing each year during the life of this chapter, each taxpayer
shall pay to the Clerk-Treasurer equal installments of his or her estimated
annual tax (on or before April 30, July 31, October 31, and January 31) so long
as at least 90% of the balance of the estimated tax shall be fully paid on or
before January 31 of the year following the taxable year involved. However, if
such taxpayer shall, on or before any such payment date, file an amended
declaration showing an increase or decrease of the estimated tax, the
installments then and thereafter due shall be increased or diminished (as the
case may be) in such manner so that at least 90% of the balance of the
estimated tax shall be fully paid on or before January 31 of the year following
the taxable year involved and thereafter, payment of installments in equal
amounts shall be required (on or before April 30, July 31, October 31 and
January 31) from and after the filing of any such amended declaration and shall
continue during the life of this chapter.
      (2)   For non-individual calendar year taxpayers. Non-individual
taxpayers who return and pay taxes on a calendar year basis, shall, at the time
of filing each declaration as required by Section
880.25, and continuing each year during the life of this chapter, shall pay to
the Clerk-Treasurer installments of the estimated annual tax liability as
follows: on or before the taxpayer’s federal return filing date; on or before
June 15, September 15, and December 15.
      (3)   For fiscal year taxpayers. Non-individual taxpyers, who or which
are permitted to make returns and pay their tax on a fiscal year basis shall,
pay their first installment on the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the first fiscal year, shall pay their second installment on the
fifteenth day of the sixth month of the taxpayer’s taxable year, shall pay
their third installment on the fifteenth day of the ninth month of the
taxpayer’s taxable year, and shall pay their fourth installment on the
fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the taxpayer’s taxable year.
   (b)   For final returns and final adjustment of tax due, see Section
880.20.
(Res. 580. Passed 12-8-70; Ord. 07-008. Passed 6-5-07.)
880.27   RECORDS TO BE KEPT BY EMPLOYERS AND TAXPAYERS.
   Employers and others subject to the tax under the Ordinance are required to
keep such records as will enable the filing of true and accurate returns,
whether of taxes withheld at source or of taxes payable upon earnings or net
profits, or both, and such records are to be preserved to enable the Clerk-
Treasurer, or any agent or employee of the Clerk-Treasurer, to verify the
correctness of the returns filed.
(Res. 580. Passed 12-8-70.)
880.28   COLLECTION OF DEFICIENCIES; ALLOWANCE OF CREDIT FOR OVERPAYMENT.
   If, as a result of an investigation conducted by the Clerk-Treasurer, a
return is found to be incorrect, the Clerk-Treasurer is authorized to assess
and collect any underpayment of tax withheld at source or any underpayment of
tax owing by any taxpayer with respect to earnings or net profits, or both. If
no return has been filed and a tax is found to be owing, tax actually owing may
be assessed and collected with or without the formality of obtaining a
delinquent return from the employer or taxpayer.
   Should it be disclosed, either as a result of an investigation by the Clerk-
Treasurer or through the medium of the filing of a claim or petition for refund
or credit, that an overpayment has been made, the Clerk-Treasurer will refund
such overpayment.
   The employer will in every instance be required to pay the full tax which
should have been withheld, even though he may fail to withhold from the
employee. If too much has been withheld the excess shall be refunded by the
employer to the employee. While the withholding agent (employer) will be
expected to maintain complete records of such adjustments with the employees,
any such adjustment made during any month will not need to be reflected in the
withholding return or disclosed by schedules or statements thereto attached.
   In those cases in which too much has been withheld by an employer from an
employee and remitted to the Clerk-Treasurer and there has been a termination
of the employees-employer relationship, the taxpayer (employee) may obtain an
adjustment by application to the Clerk-Treasurer.
(Res. 580. Passed 12-8-70.)
880.29   COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES.
   All taxes imposed by the Ordinance remaining unpaid when the same have
become due, together with all interest and penalties thereon, become a debt due
the Municipality from the taxpayer, and are recoverable as other debts by suit
instituted by the Village Solicitor.
   Employers who or which, although obliged under the Ordinance to withhold and
remit to the Clerk-Treasurer the taxes required to be withheld at the source
(see Section
880.21), shall fail to so withhold and/or remit, become liable to the
Municipality in a civil action to enforce the payment of the debt created by
such failure.
   When a final return is filed as prescribed in Section
880.20, and a deficiency is determined to be due the Municipality, action to
collect the same must be brought within three years after the tax was due or
the return was filed, whichever is later. However, in the case of fraud,
failure to file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent or more of
income required to be reported, prosecution may be commenced within six years
after the commission of the offense.
(Res. 580. Passed 12-8-70.)
880.30   EXAMINATION OF RECORDS; IDENTIFICATION OF VILLAGE PERSONNEL REQUIRED.
   Agents and employees charged with the duty of inspection or auditing of
records of employers and taxpayers will carry proper identification, which
shall be subject to examination by any person whose records are sought to be
examined.
(Res. 580. Passed 12-8-70.)
880.31   APPLICABILITY.
   These Regulations (Sections
880.17 et seq.) are inapplicable to any person or corporation upon whom or
which it is beyond the legal power of Council to impose the tax; they are
likewise inapplicable as to any property, income or profits (or part thereof)
as to which it is beyond the legal power of Council to levy the tax.
(Res. 580. Passed 12-8-70.)
880.32   SPLIT-PAYROLLS.
   In the case of hourly employees, where a payroll continues past December 31,
1970, and said payroll does not end until a period in January, 1971, said
payroll shall be considered a split-payroll, and as such said payroll will not
be subject to withholding tax under the Grafton Village Income Tax Ordinance
effective January 1, 1971. That is to say, only the first full pay for hourly
employees earned after January 1, 1971, and all payrolls thereafter, will
become subject to withholding under the Grafton Village Income Tax Ordinance.
   All salaried employees paid on a calendar month will be subject to
withholding under the Grafton Village Income Tax Ordinance as of January 1,
1971.
(Res. 580. Passed 12-8-70.)
880.33   VACATION PAY.
   Vacation pay paid in 1971 will not be subject to withholding deductions
under the Ordinance. Vacation pay paid in 1972, and in all subsequent years,
will be subject to withholding deductions under the Ordinance.
(Res. 580. Passed 12-8-70.)
880.34   OFF-SETS OF PROFIT AND LOSS.
   In the case of an individual having salary or wages subject to withholding
under the Village Income Tax, if said individual has a business, including farm
and rental property, which reflects a loss for the same accounting period, said
individual may not off-set the business loss against income earned on salary or
wages for the purpose of securing a cash refund from the Income Tax Department.
   If an individual operated more than one business, the profits of which were
subject to the Grafton Village Income Tax, said individual may off-set profits
from one business with the net loss from another business, and report the
resulting net profit or loss for Village Income Tax purposes.
   In any event, the net loss on a business used to off-set net income from
another business must exactly agree with the net loss as reported on Federal
Income Tax return Form 1040 as filed with the Federal Government.
   Any rental loss or business loss, based on income taxable under the Village
Income Tax, sustained in any year, may not be applied against rental profits or
business profits of a succeeding year or years, allocable to the Municipality.
   No carry back against profits in prior years will be permitted on any Income
Tax Return.
(Res. 580. Passed 12-8-70; Ord. 86-081. Passed 11-18-86.)
880.35   SEPARABILITY.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of the Income Tax Ordinance or
those Regulations, or any tax against any individual or any of the several
groups specified herein, is found to be unconstitutional, illegal, or invalid,
such unconstitutionality, illegality or invalidity shall affect only such
sentence, clause, section or part of the Income Tax Ordinance or these
Regulations and shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions,
sentences, clauses, sections or other parts of the Income Tax Ordinance or
these Regulations. It is hereby declared to be the intention of Council that
the Income Tax Ordinance and these Regulations would have been adopted had such
unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section or part thereof
not been included herein.
880.99   PENALTY.
   (a)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this
chapter, for which no penalty is otherwise provided, is guilty of a misdemeanor
of the third degree and shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars
($500.00) or imprisoned not more than sixty days, or both, for each offense. A
separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a
violation or noncompliance occurs or continues.
   (b)   In addition to the penalty provided in subsection (a) hereof, whoever
violates Section
880.06(e) shall be immediately dismissed from the service of the Municipality.
Each disclosure shall constitute a separate offense.

compensation, and on net profits as hereinafter provided.
   (b)   (1)   The annual tax is levied at a rate of one and one half percent
(1.50% percent). The tax is levied at a uniform rate on all persons residing in

881.02   DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this
chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to Federal income taxation or in Ohio R.C. Title
LVII, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to Federal income tax
and in Ohio Title LVII and the use is not consistent, then the use of the term
in the laws of the United States relating to Federal income tax shall control
over the use of the term in Ohio R.C. Title LVII.
   (b)   The singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall include
the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   (c)   As used in this chapter:
      (1)   “Adjusted Federal taxable income,” for a person required to file as
a C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C
corporation under division (c)(24)D. of this section, means a C corporation’s
Federal taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as
determined under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
         A.   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in Federal
taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income;
         B.   Add an amount equal to 5% of intangible income deducted under
division (c)(1)A. of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         C.   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
Federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
         D.   1.   Except as provided in division (c)(1)D.2. of this section,
deduct income and gain included in Federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
            2.   Division (c)(1)D.1. of this section does not apply to the

of the Internal Revenue Code.
         E.   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of Federal taxable income;
         F.   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated

this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable
year beginning on or after January 1. 2017.
            The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net
profit that is reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce
municipal taxable income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net
operating loss carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years
following the taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for
more years than necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
            2.   No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (c)(1)H.
of this section to offset qualifying wages.
            3.   a.   For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, or
2022, a person may not deduct more than 50% of the amount of the deduction
otherwise allowed by division (c)(1)H.1. of this section.

person from carrying forward, use with respect to any return filed for a
taxable year beginning after 2018, any amount of net operating loss that was
not fully utilized by operation of division (c)(1)H.3.a. of this section. To
the extent that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully utilized in

is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable year
beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in division
(c)(1)H.3.a. of this section shall apply to the amount carried forward.
         I.   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer’s Federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group’s Federal taxable income in accordance with Section
881.05(v)(3)B.
         J.   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer’s Federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group’s Federal taxable income in accordance with Section
881.05(v)(3)B.
         If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity
that has made an election described in division (c)(48)B. of this section, is
not a publicly traded partnership that has made the election described in
division (c)(24)D. of this section, and is not an individual, the taxpayer
shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income under this section as if the
taxpayer were a C corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar
amounts paid or accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible
expense unless such payments are in consideration for the use of capital and
treated as payment of interest under Section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code
or United States Treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified
self-employed retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer,
amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts
paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.

purposes of federal self-employment tax.

other compensation from whatever source earned or received by the resident,
including the resident’s distributive share of the net profit of pass-through
entities owned directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the
resident. This is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
881.02 (c)(16)).
   (b)   For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions,
and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by the
nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident’s distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
   (c)   For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to “municipal
taxable income” as defined in Section
881.02(c)(21). Exemptions which may apply are specified in Section
881.02(c)(12).
   (d)   Refundable Credit for Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan.
      (1)   As used in this division:
         A.   “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan” means a compensation
plan described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         B.   “Qualifying loss” means the amount of compensation attributable
to a taxpayer’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the receipt of
money and property attributable to distributions from the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of money and
property is made by the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The taxpayer
sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the taxpayer
receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   1.   “Qualifying tax rate” means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to Municipality with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            2.   If different tax rates applied for different taxable years,
then the “qualifying tax rate” is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to Municipality
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         D.   “Refundable credit” means the amount of Municipality income tax
that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   If, in addition to Municipality, a taxpayer has paid tax to other
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal
corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation’s
proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to
Municipality for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer’s qualifying loss is attributable to:
         A.   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         B.   The employee’s failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer’s terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
   (e)   Domicile.
      (1)   A.   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in Municipality for
all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in Municipality
on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if the Tax
Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
         B.   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (e)(1)A. of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in
Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
      (2)   For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled
in Municipality for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be
considered include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   The individual’s domicile in other taxable years;
         B.   The location at which the individual is registered to vote;
         C.   The address on the individual’s driver’s license;
         D.   The location of real estate for which the individual claimed a
property tax exemption or reduction allowed on the basis of the individual’s
residence or domicile;
         E.   The location and value of abodes owned or leased by the
individual;
         F.   Declarations, written or oral, made by the individual regarding
the individual’s residency;
         G.   The primary location at which the individual is employed;
         H.   The location of educational institutions attended by the
individual’s dependents as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code,
to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual’s spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
         I.   The number of contact periods the individual has with
Municipality. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one “contact
period” with Municipality if the individual is away overnight from the
individual’s abode located outside of Municipality and while away overnight
from that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in Municipality.
      (3)   All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations.
   (f)   Businesses. This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a
business or profession in Municipality, unless the taxpayer is an individual
who resides in Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined
company, or telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 5745.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion
as the average ratio of the following:
         A.   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of all
of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual’s services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
881.04(c);
         C.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in Municipality
to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period
from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   A.   If the apportionment factors described in division (f)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer’s business
activity in Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         B.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
881.12(a).
         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (f)(2)A. of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
881.12(a).
         D.   Nothing in division (f)(2) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (f)(1)B. of this section, “wages, salaries, and
other compensation” includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         A.   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            1.   The employer;
            2.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            3.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described
in (f)(3)A.2. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor, customer,
client, or patient.
         B.   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee’s presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (f)(3)A. or B. of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer’s municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator’s determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of division (f)(1)C. of this section, receipts
from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sit used to a
municipal corporation as follows:
         A.   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in Municipality if,
regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the following
criteria:
            1.   The property is shipped to or delivered within Municipality
from a stock of goods located within Municipality.
            2.   The property is delivered within Municipality from a location
outside Municipality, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its
own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within Municipality and
the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            3.   The property is shipped from a place within Municipality to
purchasers outside the Municipality, provided that the taxpayer is not, through
its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales
at the place where delivery is made.
         B.   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
Municipality to the extent that such services are performed in Municipality.
         C.   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of

property shall be sitused to Municipality based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in Municipality.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to Municipality’s tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in Municipality or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of Municipality.
Municipality shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for
the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the
municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to Municipality, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in
Municipality to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of Municipality shall report the

section for the purposes of that division or division (f)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner’s ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

881.04   COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Withholding Provisions. Each employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer located or doing business in Municipality shall withhold an income tax
from the qualifying wages earned and/or received by each employee in
Municipality. Except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required
under Section
881.03 or division (b)(4) or (b)(6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld
at the rate, specified in Section
881.03 of this chapter, of 1.50%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that
the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively
pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit
of, the employee.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of Municipality the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         A.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of Municipality in the preceding calendar year exceeded two thousand
three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399.00), or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of
Municipality any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two hundred
dollars ($200.00).
               Payment under division (b)(1)A. of this section shall be made so
that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days
after the last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         B.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)A. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end of each
calendar quarter.
         C.   Intentionally left blank.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying Federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other Federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of Municipality. The payment of tax
by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer’s,
agent’s, or other payer’s obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and Municipality as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee’s employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold Municipality income tax with respect to an individual’s
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation’s successor entity.
      (5)   A.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer’s, agent’s, or other
payer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         B.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
Municipality income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for Municipality until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         A.   The names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for Municipality during the preceding calendar year;
         B.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         C.   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         D.   Any other information required for Federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         E.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer’s or employee’s liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Municipality income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer’s employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer’s control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer’s control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee’s
qualifying wages subject to division (c)(2)A.1. of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee’s “principal place of work” with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            2.   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an

section, an employer is not required to withhold Municipality income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in Municipality if the employee performed such services in Municipality on 20
or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions
applies:
            1.   The employee’s principal place of work is located in
Municipality.
            2.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in Municipality. For the purposes of this division,
“presumed worksite location” means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in Municipality at which the employer provides or provided services
that can reasonably be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last
more than 20 days in a calendar year. Services can “reasonably be expected by

more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.
            3.   The employee is a resident of Municipality and has requested

performance of services in the employee’s capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         B.   For the purposes of division (c)(2)A. of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in
Municipality only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in Municipality than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee
spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee’s
principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to

principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (c)(2)A. of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee’s qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)B. of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in Municipality exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to Municipality for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in Municipality.
         B.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for Municipality
under division (c)(4)A. of this section may elect to withhold tax for
Municipality for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages
to the employee for personal services performed in Municipality.
      (5)   If an employer’s fixed location is Municipality and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
881.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee’s qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to
Municipality, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked
outside the corporate boundaries of Municipality.

   (f)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer’s Social Security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an individual
to include, with each annual return and amended return, copies of the following
documents: all of the taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service form W-2, “Wage and
Tax Statements,” including all information reported on the taxpayer’s Federal
W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and, with
respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to support
the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files
the annual return required by this section electronically is not required to
provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
            A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer’s
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under Ohio
R.C. 5747.08(G). The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on
forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to Municipality. No remittance is required if the net
amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer’s taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to Municipality. No remittance is
required if the net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer’s Federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of Municipality’s income tax
return. The extended due date of Municipality’s income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is
not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator
grants an extension of that date.
         A.   A copy of the Federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of Municipality’s income tax return.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer’s Federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer’s Municipality income tax return. If the request is
received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Municipality income
tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer’s requested
extension.
      (3)   If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing State income tax returns under Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of Municipality’s income tax
return. The extended due date of Municipality’s income tax return shall be the
same as the extended due date of the State income tax return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by Municipality, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)   To the extent that any provision in this division (g) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) prevail.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, Municipality shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (f)(3) of this section.
   (i)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under Section
881.04(b)(1)A. or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (j)   Taxes withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
881.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by Municipality, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to Municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by Municipality to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by Municipality, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by
Municipality or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax
return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions
of this chapter and of Municipality’s ordinance, resolution, or rules and
regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
   (m)   Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
      (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer’s net profit from a business or profession may file Municipality’s
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
   (n)   Extension for Service in or for the Armed Forces. Each member of the
National Guard of any state and each member of a reserve component of the Armed
Forces of the United States called to active duty pursuant to an executive
order issued by the President of the United States or an act of the Congress of
the United States, and each civilian serving as support personnel in a combat
zone or contingency operation in support of the Armed Forces, may apply to the
Tax Administrator of Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of
the return and an extension of time for payment of taxes required by
Municipality during the period of the member’s or civilian’s duty service, and
for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or before the one
hundred eightieth day after the member’s or civilian’s duty terminates. An
applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers
necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (o)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant’s active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required lo pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant’s active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (o)(1) of this
division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (p)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (n) and (o) of this section.
      (2)   A.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (p)(2)A. of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, “qualifying taxpayer” means a member of the
National Guard or a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the President of the United States or an act of the Congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the Armed Forces.
         B.   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (f)
(2)A. of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (q)   For each taxable year to which division (n), (o), or (p) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (o)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
   (r)   Consolidated Municipal Income Tax Return. As used in this section:

defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a

Internal Revenue Code.

purposes of filing a consolidated Federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. “Consolidated
Federal taxable income” does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

R.C. 5727.01.
   (s)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to Municipality’s
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under Federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (s)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (s)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (s)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (t)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipality income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm’s length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to Municipality. A taxpayer that is required to file
a consolidated Municipality income tax return for a taxable year shall file a
consolidated Municipality income tax return for all subsequent taxable years,
unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax
Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change
in circumstances.
   (u)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Municipality income tax return

   (v)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (v)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in Section
881.02, by substituting “consolidated Federal taxable income” for “federal
taxable income” wherever “federal taxable income” appears in that division and
by substituting “an affiliated group of corporation’s” for “a C corporation’s”
wherever “a C corporation’s” appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
881.02(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity’s net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this Section
881.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused to the
Municipality. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this Section
881.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused to the
Municipality. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity’s net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this Section
881.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused to
Municipality;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Municipality income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (w)   Corporations filing a consolidated Municipality income tax return
shall make the computations required under divisions (r) through (y) of this
Section
881.05 by substituting “consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to”
for “net profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in that section and by
substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for “taxpayer” wherever
“taxpayer” appears in that section.
   (x)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by Municipality in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with Municipality before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with Municipality may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
(Ord. 15-032. Passed 11-3-15.)
881.06   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (a)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the Municipality who is
required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may
claim a nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the
other municipality. Subject to division (c) of this section, the credit shall
not exceed the tax due the Municipality under this chapter.
   (b)   Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (c)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (a) of this section, “the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation” subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.

   (b)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld for Municipality from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the Municipality in equal amounts on each payment date
unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually
withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which
the amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division, “date of
the postmark” means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.

estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than 12 months

including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         C.    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 67.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         D.   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the

      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an

the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with Municipality under
Section
881.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in Municipality but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

881.08   ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required

shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer’s originally filed annual income tax return, the

requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section

date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall

Municipality claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the
tax or withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income
or wages.
   (c)   If Municipality’s tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using
Municipality’s tax rate. However, if Municipality’s tax rate is greater than
the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the
nonrefundable credit is to be paid to Municipality, along with any penalty and
interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (d)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 15-032. Passed 11-3-15.)
881.11   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   If a taxpayer’s tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
Municipality changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer’s Federal or
State income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
Municipality. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer’s consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due. together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten

filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer’s Federal or State income tax return only:
         A.   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or
         B.   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
881.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened, i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (d) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10.00),
no refund need be paid by Municipality. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer’s Federal or State income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
881.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.

described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, “qualifying deferral period” means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
881.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party

is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that

881.09.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the

the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by Municipality does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the

(Ord. 15-032. Passed 11-3-15.)
881.13   AUDITS.
   (a)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer’s rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
      (1)   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the
taxpayer’s attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
      (2)   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer’s case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 15-032. Passed 11-3-15.)
881.14   SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Last known address” means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   “Undeliverable address” means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056 is not able
to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for
non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (b)   Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the assessment’s postmark.
         B.   Once the Tax Administrator or other Municipality official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(c)(1)A. of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
            “This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date.”
            Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
            If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)
(1)A. of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and.
when the assessment was mailed, the person’s agent or the person’s affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person’s affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee’s business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Municipality
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator’s designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 15-032. Passed 11-3-15.)
881.15   ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)   As used in this section, “claim” means a claim for an amount payable
to Municipality that arises pursuant to Municipality’s income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator’s rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 15-032. Passed 11-3-15.)
881.16   TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person’s official duties or the official business of Municipality as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax
Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 15-032. Passed 11-3-15.)
881.17   FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Municipality ordinance or State
law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud Municipality or the Tax Administrator.

      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
Municipality to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (c)   Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person’s Social Security
number, Federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.

to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
         I.   The number of contact periods the individual has with the
Village. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact

in the Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the

involving one or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would

            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         B.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
882.12(a).
         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (f)(2)A. of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
882.12(a).
         D.   Nothing in division (f)(2) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (f)(3)A. or B. of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of division (f)(1)C. of this section, receipts
from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:
         A.   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title

Village to the extent that such services are performed in the Village.

of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Village's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the Village or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the Village.
The Village shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for
the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the
municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the Village, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the
Village to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real
estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of the Village shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's

   Withholding Provisions.
   (a)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the Village shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in the Village. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
882.03 or division (b)(4) or (b)(6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld
at the rate, specified in Section
882.03, of one and one-half percent (1.50%). An employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the
date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or
constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to
the benefit of, the employee.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the Village the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         A.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Village in the preceding calendar year exceeded two thousand
three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Village any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two hundred
dollars ($200.00).
            Payments under division (b)(1)A. of this section shall be made to
the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of each
month for which the tax was withheld.
         B.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)A. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         C.   Intentionally left blank.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the Village as the return
required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Village income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   A.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         B.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Village the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Village income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         A.   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Village during the preceding calendar year;
         B.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         C.   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         D.   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         E.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

         C.   "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means

fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's

            If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the "greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (c)(2)A.1. of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with
division (c)(2)B. of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted

section, an employer is not required to withhold the Village income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the Village if the employee performed such services in the Village on twenty
or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions
applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Village.
            2.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Village. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
Village at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than twenty days
in a calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to
last more than 20 days" if either of the following applies at the time the
services commence:
               a.   The nature of the services is such that it will require
more than twenty days of the services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than twenty days.
            3.   The employee is a resident of the Village and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
882.04.
            4.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         B.   For the purposes of division (c)(2)A. of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the Village than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee
spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to

            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pickup for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (c)(2)A. of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)B. of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Village exceeds the twenty-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to the Village for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in the Village.
         B.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village
under division (c)(4)A. of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
Village for the first twenty days on which the employer paid qualifying wages
to the employee for personal services performed in the Village.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is the Village and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
882.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Village, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the Village.
         To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator
with the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (c)(2)A. and (c)(4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement

882.05   ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (a)   An annual Village income tax return shall be completed and filed by

      (1)   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section

other payer, and no additional tax is due the Village.
      (2)   Retirees having no municipal taxable income for Village income tax
purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written

individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,

of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio form

necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the

      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or

return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is

the filing of the Village's income tax return.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's Village income tax return. If
the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the
Village income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the
taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of R.C. § 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
Village's income tax return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Village, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)   To the extent that any provision in this division (g) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) prevail.
   (h)   (l)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Village shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount

      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village for a taxable

      (3)   A.   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person does
not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the Village income tax ordinance for a

            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with the Village
for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location (as defined in Section 882.04(c)(1)G. within
the Village.
            2.   The person no longer provides services in the Village and does
not expect to be subject to the Village income tax for the taxable year.
         B.   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales with the Village. The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within the Village, make any sales in the Village, or otherwise become subject
to the tax levied by the Village for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be
considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the Village
income tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (h)(3)B.
of this section the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change.
         D.   Nothing in division (h)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (i)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp

other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Village to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize

income tax return, report, or document required by the Village, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the
Village or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this
chapter and of the Village's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations

duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the Village
for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time
for payment of taxes required by the Village during the period of the member's
or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty
terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (o)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified

otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (o)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (p)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (n) and (o) of this section.
      (2)   A.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (p)(2)A. of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order

contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         B.   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (p)
(2)A. of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (q)   For each taxable year to which division (n), (o), or (p) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (o)(2) and (o)(3) of

   Consolidated Municipal Income Tax Return.
   (r)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated

Internal Revenue Code.

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 4927.01.

   (s)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Village's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (s)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (s)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (s)(1) or (s)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under R.C. § 718.80, a
valid election made by a taxpayer under division (s)(1) or (s)(2) of this
section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of the five-year
period.
      (5)   When an election made under R.C. § 718.80 is terminated, a valid
election made under R.C. § 718.86 is binding upon the Tax Administrator for the
remainder of the five-year period.
   (t)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Village income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the Village. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated
Village income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated Village
income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer
requests and receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a
separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (u)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Village income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (v)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (v)(2), (v)(3), and
(v)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income
tax return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
882.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under this chapter to the extent
that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has
been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal
taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that passthrough entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the passthrough entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the Village;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Village income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (w)   Corporations filing a consolidated Village income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (r) through (y) of this section
by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to" for "net
profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (x)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the Village in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (c) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed the tax due the Village under this chapter.
   (b)   The Village shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Village who works in a joint economic development zone created
under R.C. § 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
R.C. § 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (c)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (a) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.

         A.   Taxes withheld for the Village from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the Village in equal amounts on each payment date unless
the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld,
in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the
amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds

including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:

         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%) of the tax liability
for the taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the

   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section 882.18 upon
the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless the
underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of this
section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For

division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if

immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100
percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with the
Village under Section
882.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that

   (b)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax

Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (c)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
882.21.
   (d)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (c) of this section shall be considered to have been

on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (e)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or ninety (90) days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing
the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable
year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return
on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described
in Section 882.18(a)(4).

been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the Village as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (b)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village is subject to recovery by the Village. If
the Village's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a

shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the Village
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (c)   If the Village's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Village's tax rate. However, if the Village's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to the Village, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (d)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 18-026. Passed 12-18-18.)
882.11   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the Village changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
Village. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         A.   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         B.   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
882.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (e) of Section
882.12 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10.00),
no refund need be paid by the Village. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
882.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (d)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village's tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Village return showing income subject
to the Village income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Village income tax
shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax
or overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10.00).
(Ord. 18-026. Passed 12-18-18.)
882.12   LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
882.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth day
after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is
either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
882.09.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
882.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (e) of Section
882.09.
   (e)   No civil action to recover the Village income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 18-026. Passed 12-18-18.)
882.13   AUDITS.
   (a)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer. A
taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting an
audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 18-026. Passed 12-18-18.)
882.14   SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056 is not able to
deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-
delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (b)   Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. § 5703.056. With
the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator
may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this
section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056. If
the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within sixty days after the assessment's
postmark.
         B.   Once the Tax Administrator or other Village official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within sixty days after the receipt
of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under
division (c)(1)A. of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is
complete, and that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
            "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date."
            Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
            If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)
(1)A. of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent (20%), as determined by
voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 18-026. Passed 12-18-18.)
882.15   ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village that arises pursuant to the Village's income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 18-026. Passed 12-18-18.)
882.16   TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the Village from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 18-026. Passed 12-18-18.)
882.17   FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Village ordinance or state law to
be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud the Village or the Tax Administrator.

accordance with division (a)(2) of this section.
      (5)   "Return" includes any tax return, report, reconciliation, schedule,
and other document required to be filed with the Tax Administrator or the
Village by a taxpayer, employer, any agent of the employer, or any other payer
pursuant to applicable law, including at any time before January 1, 2016.

      (8)   "Unpaid withholding tax" means withholding tax due but not paid by

      (9)   "Withholding tax" includes amounts an employer, any agent of an

years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         B.   Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required to
be paid or remitted to the Village on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016 but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the Village to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (c)   Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer
for any reason fail, in whole or in part, to make timely and full payment or
remittance of income tax, estimated income tax, or withholding tax or to file
timely with the Village any return required to be filed, the following

properly imposed or collected before January 1, 2016.

(Ord. 18-026. Passed 12-18-18.)
882.19   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
   Authority.
   (a)   Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the Ohio Revised Code:
      (1)   A.   Exercise all powers whatsoever of a query nature as provided
by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records, memorandums,
and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under oath, to
issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         B.   The powers referred to in this division of this section shall be
exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance of
the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the Village's
income tax ordinance;
      (2)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)   Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and
states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)   Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax

provided in this chapter;
      (5)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to

computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made.
         B.   If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or other
appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-determine, or
correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order which the Tax

      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in Section

   (b)   (1)   A Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the Village or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
   Identification Information.
   (c)   (1)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
882.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
882.99.
         B.   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (c) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
882.18.
         C.   The penalties provided for under divisions (c)(2)A. and B. of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
882.99 for a violation of Section
882.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.
(Ord. 18-026. Passed 12-18-18.)
882.20   REQUEST FOR OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (b)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator in accordance with the Rules and Regulations.
   (c)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (d)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.
   (e)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds the Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (f)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal.

   (a)   (1)   The Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Village, but
such appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Village at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Mayor
of the Village. This member may be an employee of the Village but may not be
the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or
other similar official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax
matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (2)   The term for members of the Board of Tax Review of the Village
shall be two years. There is no limit on the number of terms that a member may
serve if the member is reappointed by the legislative authority. The Board
member appointed by the Mayor of the Village shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (3)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.
      (4)   A member of the Board of Tax Review who, for any reason, ceases to
meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
      (6)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax Review.
The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the
assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within
sixty days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within
sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within ninety days after
the Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal and send a copy of its
final determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within
fifteen days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in R.C. § 5717.011.
   (f)   The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under R.C. §
149.43. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax Review created
pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body subject to R.C. §
121.22.

that slopes either toward the paved portion of the street or the adjoining
property at a ratio of more than one inch per horizontal foot.
      (3)   Longitudinal slope. Other than handicapped ramps as set forth in
Ohio R.C. 1355.04, an individual slab, or fragmented section of a slab, that
deviates from the average line of the sidewalk surface level at a ratio of more
than one inch per linear foot.
      (4)   Gaps. A space between slabs, or the depth of the gap between slabs,
in excess of one inch in width, and those caused by the absence of a fragmented
section of the sidewalk, exceeding one inch in width.
      (5)   Surface quality.
         A.   Cracked slabs. Slabs fragmented by cracks into four or more
sections, where any one of the gaps between fragments is greater than one inch
in width or depth.
         B.   Pitted slabs. Slabs whose surface is granular and contains
hazardous depressions of surface breakup in excess of one inch in depth. Depth
is to be determined by a two-foot straight edge laid on the surface of the

         B.   The special conditions and circumstances must not be created
solely by the applicant.
   (g)   Assessment of Installation of Sidewalks. At its option, the Village
may utilize the provisions contained in Ohio R.C. Chapter 727 or Section 729.11
to repair, replace or construct sidewalks that are in violation of any
provision of these Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 98-009. Passed 5-19-98.)
1028.03   REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW WALKS.
   (a)   Statement of Need. The need is to develop a means of constructing
sidewalks in areas of the Village where none exist. The specific purposes are
eliminating hazards to the safety of pedestrians and providing access to
schools, churches, businesses, recreation areas, etc.
   (b)   Program Requirements. The program must have the following elements:
      (1)   Criteria to identify specific areas where sidewalks are needed
should be established. Possible areas are: gaps in existing sidewalks in
established residential areas; business areas not now having walks along highly
traveled roadways; and subdivisions and other residential developments either
existing or proposed. The criteria must be objective and contain factors that
can be measured and understood. Hazardous safety conditions should be
identified. Abutting property owners should benefit.
      (2)   A complete survey to determine areas that need new walks, based on
the criteria, should be made. The survey shall be completed by a committee
consisting of members of the Sidewalk Commission and the Village Administrator
or his or her designee.
      (3)   Program enforcement shall be established through adequate
legislation. The legislation must be carefully prepared, given an adequate
hearing for all interested parties and supported by Council after enactment.
   (c)   Program Benefits. The benefits may be obvious, if pedestrian traffic
is made safer and more convenient and if better service is provided to any
citizens.
(Ord. 98-009. Passed 5-19-98.)
1028.99   PENALTY.
   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this
chapter is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) for each offense. A separate offense shall be deemed
committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance occurs or
continues.

1042.01   RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The following rules and regulations of the Village water system are hereby
enacted:
   (a)   Memorandum. The Village water system was originally financed under
revenue bonds. This means that the water user is paying for the pumping
station, the water tower and all of the water mains and accessories, as well as
for treated water, when he or she pays his or her water bill, and the cost of
the foregoing items were included in determining the rate charges.
   (b)   Water Department Defined. As used in these rules and regulations,
"Water Department" means the Village Water Department.
   (c)   Enumeration of Rules.
         Rule 1. Applications for installation of services.
         A.   The applicant shall apply to the Utilities Office. The applicant
shall furnish all information needed and sign a contract for water service.
         B.   The applicant shall pay his or her tap-in fee and meter charge
before the Water Department will issue a work order to make the water tap and
installation of the water meter.
         Rule 2. Rendering of water bills. Water bills shall be made out and
mailed in the property owner's name, and no bill, except initial or final
bills, will be rendered for less than the three-month (quarterly) minimum
charge. Billings shall be quarterly.
               When meters are installed prior to the fifteenth of the month,
the full month shall be billed. In rendering final bills where consumers move
out at odd dates in the month, water must be turned off and a final meter
reading taken. When the use of water exceeds fifteen days of the month, a full
monthly minimum charge will be billed.
         Rule 3. Due date of water bills. Water bills are due and payable
quarterly at the Utilities Office or an authorized agent on the due date as
shown. All bills paid after the final date for payment shall bear a penalty of
ten percent of the billing.
         Rule 4. Order of payment. Accounts for water service must be paid in
the order in which they are contracted. The Village Administrator may refuse
payment of an account except when each account is paid in the order incurred;
in other words, payment of a current account will not be accepted until all
prior accounts for the same premises have been paid.
         Rule 5. Delinquent accounts. Once each year delinquent water accounts
may be certified for collection pursuant to law.
         Rule 6. Shutting off water. Delinquencies in the payment of water
bills shall subject the user to the shutting off of water at the premises until
the bill is paid in full. A charge of twelve dollars ($12.00) will be added to
the bill for turning water on again.
               When water service is shut off because of delinquency, the
property owner shall continue to be billed the minimum charge for the size of
the water meter.
         Rule 7. Estimating of water consumption. If a meter fails to register,
the consumption of water shall be estimated from the amount consumed during a
period when water was supplied under similar conditions and was correctly
measured.
         Rule 8. Purchase and location of meters. All meters shall be purchased
from the Water Department. A meter shall be set, removed or adjusted only by
employees of the Department. The location of such meter must be satisfactory to
the Department, and the plumbing must be so arranged that the meter can be set
in place without disturbing any of the water piping. Meters will not be
permitted to be installed in coal cellars, crawl spaces or other inaccessible
places.
         Rule 9. Meter boxes. On property where there is no suitable place for
a meter, a meter box shall be required, and the same shall be supplied at the
property owner's expense. The meter box shall conform to standards set by the
Water Department. Meter boxes may be purchased from the Department.
         Rule 10. Meter readings. Meter readings shall be taken quarterly as
near the same date each quarter as is possible. If the meter reader is unable
to procure a reading after two calls, an estimated charge shall be made upon an
estimated reading as provided in Rule 7.
         Rule 11. Meter repairs. The cost of repairing or replacing meters
shall be paid by the property owner if, in the opinion of the Water Department,
there is evidence of negligence contributing to the disrepair or need for
replacement of the water meter. The Department shall provide the service and
add the cost to the water bills. If the meter seal is found broken or other
proof of tampering with the meter is found, the bill for the period in question
shall be estimated.
         Rule 12. Tampering with meters. The criminal laws of the State provide
severe penalties for tampering with water meters, meter seals, etc. The payment
of any penalty levied against a property owner will not in any way relieve any
person from criminal prosecution.
         Rule 13. Meter testing. The Water Department will test a water meter,
subject to the following conditions:
         A.   A deposit of twelve dollars ($12.00) is required.
         B.   If the meter is found to over register by an amount exceeding two
and one-half percent, the deposit shall be refunded, another meter shall be
furnished and an equitable reduction shall be made on the water bill over a
period not to exceed twelve months.
         C.   If the meter does not over register by an amount exceeding two
and one-half percent, the bill shall be paid in full and the deposit will not
be refunded.
         D.   If the meter is found to under register by an amount exceeding
two and one-half percent the deposit shall not be refunded and an equitable
charge shall be added to the consumer's billing over a period not to exceed
twelve months. The charge shall be based on previous consumption over a period
not to exceed twelve months.
         Rule 14. Service connections. New water service connections shall be
placed not closer than twenty-four inches to any sewer or water line. Minimum
cover shall be three feet six inches. Service shall not be located under
driveways and shall be placed as close to the center of the lot as is
practical.
         Rule 15. Single service connections required. No service pipe
connection to the main by one corporation cock shall be extended into two
distinct premises, dwellings or tenements.
               In the case of a double or duplex dwelling, there shall be two
service connections and two meters. Only one tap-in fee need be paid, but a
double header connection must be purchased from the Water Department.
               In apartment houses or business places, the plumbing shall be so
arranged that all water used on the premises shall pass through one master
meter.
         Rule 16. Tampering with curb and corporation cocks. The curb shut off
as well as the corporation cock shall be under the absolute control of the
Water Department and shall not be tampered with or operated by any person
except an authorized employee or agent of the Department.
               A licensed plumber may, upon notification of the Department,
turn on the water for testing purposes, but must shut it off after the test is
made. When the plumbing has been tested, the jumper or spacer pipe shall be
removed so the meter can be set. The plumber shall call the Department to have
the meter installed.
         Rule 17. Stop and waste shut off. A service pipe for domestic supply
must be provided with an approved stop and waste cock where it enters the
building. Such stop and waste cock shall be easily accessible and so installed
that the water can be shut off and drained from the pipes and meter. In all
houses where there is no basement and where meters have to be set in utility
rooms or kitchens, a shut-off valve must be set ahead and back of the meter to
stop the siphoning of water from plumbing and hot water tanks on the floor. All
services larger than three-fourths inch in diameter must have a shut-off valve
on both sides of the meter so that the meter may be removed without draining
all pipes in the building. All meters two inches or larger must be by-passed by
the plumber and sealed by the Water Department.
         Rule 18. Opening streets. Where services are laid crossing a paved
street, the property owner shall pay the cost of repaving such street so
excavated for construction of the service. Application to open a street must be
made to the Village Administrator.
         Rule 19. Leaks in services. Water service pipe between the curb stop
and the water meter must be maintained at the expense of the property owner.
The property owner will be held responsible for any leakage which may occur in
such service pipe, and the Water Department reserves the right to turn off the
water in cases where leakage does exist.
               Service pipe between the main and the curb stop shall be
maintained by the Department.
         Rule 20. Installation of new service connections. When the service
pipe between the main and the curb stop is found to be deteriorated to the
extent that permanent repairs cannot be made, a new service will be required to
be installed at the expense of the property owner. The failure of the owner,
within thirty days after notification, to authorize such new service to be
installed will be deemed to be sufficient cause for discontinuing the supply of
water to the premises.
         Rule 21. Additions and alterations. No additions or alteration in any
service pipe between the water main and the meter, and no change of any meter,
shall be made without the permission of the Water Department.
         Rule 22. Leaking pipes. The Water Department may not furnish water
where there are leaking pipes. The Department reserves the right to not furnish
water until the necessary repairs are made.
         Rule 23. Use of fire hydrants. Fire hydrants are intended primarily
for the use of the Fire Department. Permits for their use for other purposes
are given reluctantly and only in cases when their use cannot be avoided. The
drawing of water from fire hydrants by unauthorized persons is strictly
prohibited, and a violation of this rule may cause arrest.
         Rule 24. Turning on water. No plumber or other person, except a duly
authorized agent of the Water Department, shall turn water on in any premises
except in the manner provided in Rule 16.
         Rule 25. Water for building purposes. Water used for individual home
building purposes shall be billed at the minimum rate of fifteen dollars
($15.00) for three months of use. Developers shall install a master meter and
shall pay for actual water consumed with a minimum quarterly charge depending
on the size of the meter if use does not exceed the minimum consumption.
               No water for building purposes shall be furnished between
November 1 and April 1 due to freezing weather.
         Rule 26. Access to property. Authorized employees of the Water
Department shall have access at all reasonable hours to the premises supplied
with water for the purpose of reading meters and to see that all rules are
observed.
         Rule 27. Water in subdivisions. The contractor or developer shall
install new services from the water main to the houses or buildings. The
contractor shall tap the main and set curb stops. Services to buildings will be
placed in the center of the lots. The Village shall not be responsible for
services until the water system has been officially accepted by the Water
Department. All water transmission lines installed after the effective date of
these rules and regulations shall be a minimum of eight inches in diameter.
         Rule 28. Water rates for new subdivisions. The Village will give the
developer a credit for enough standard water tap fees to equal the approved
construction cost of the water distribution extension.
               All tap-in fees above the approved construction cost must be
paid by the developer. If the total credit for tap-in fees does not equal the
approved construction cost, the developer must bear this additional cost.
               The water rates for users within the subdivision shall be the
same as those stipulated under Section
1042.05.
               The developer must also bear the cost of all other charges,
including the cost of water meters, water tap inspection fees, etc.
         Rule 29. Transfer of water rights and responsibilities. A purchaser of
property being served by the water system shall visit the Water Department,
supply needed information and sign a contract for the transfer of water rights
and responsibilities. No person is entitled to receive water unless he or she
has signed such contract. The Department reserves the right to shut off the
water to any premises when the owner is not under contract to the City.
         Rule 30. Private fire pipe lines. All fire extinguisher service
connections to supply water to sprinkler systems or private fire hydrants (for
fire use only) must be metered. The design of the system must follow good
design practice and all cross-connections between possible sources of pollution
and the general water supply must be avoided.
         Rule 31. Payment for fire lines. All charges and water rates provided
for in these rules and regulations shall apply to fire lines. The property
owner shall pay all costs for repairing leaks in fire lines and apparatus.
         Rule 32. Private water lines. No private lines will be allowed in the
water system. All users must be tied into adequately sized water mains.
         Rule 33. Emergencies. In times of emergency or during periods of
temporary problems relative to the supply, production or distribution of water,
the Village Administrator may restrict the use of water with any action deemed
necessary in order to best provide for the protection of life and property and
for the ultimate welfare of Village residents. Actions taken under this rule
must be reported to the Mayor and Council.
1042.02   TAPPING OF WATER MAINS; INSTALLATION OF WATER LINES.
   (a)   No person, except a licensed plumber approved by the Village, or an
employee of the Water Department, shall be permitted to tap any water main
under the control of the Village or to install service therefrom to a meter for
the furnishing of water.
   (b)   No person, except such a licensed plumber or employee of the
Department, shall turn on or shut off water at the valves provided by the
Village for such purpose.
   (c)   No trench in which a water line is connected with the water system of
the Village shall be backfilled until the installation of the water line
therein has been inspected by the Operator of the Water Supply Utility by a
duly authorized employee of the Village or by a licensed plumber appointed by
the Village.
   (d)   In the installation of a water line from the curb box to the meter,
only new pipe inspected by a licensed plumber appointed by the Village or a
duly authorized employee of the Department shall be used, and only copper pipe
or plastic pipe, as approved by the Village Administrator, shall be used for
such purpose.
(Adopting Ordinance)
   (e)   From and after the effective date of this subsection (Ordinance 86-
071, passed April 15, 1986), all private lateral water lines from a structure

pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the public
potable water system.
         B.   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-
connections, actual or potential, between the public or consumer's potable
water system and non-potable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources or
systems containing process fluids.
         C.   If, in the judgment of the Water Operator of Record, an approved
backflow prevention device is necessary for the safety of the public water
system, the Water Operator of Record will give notice to the water consumer to
install such an approved device immediately. The water consumer shall, at his
or her own expense, install such an approved device at a location and in a
manner approved by the Water Operator of Record and shall have inspections and
tests made of such approved devices as required by the Water Operator of
Record.
         D.   No person shall establish or maintain, or permit to be
established or maintained, any connection whereby a private, auxiliary or
emergency water supply other than the regular public water supply of the
Village may enter the supply or distribution system of the Village, unless such
private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and the method of connection and
use of such supply have been approved by the Water Operator of Record and by
the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
         E.   The Water Operator of Record shall cause surveys and
investigations to be made of industrial and other properties served by the
public water supply where actual or potential hazards to the public water
supply may exist. Such surveys and investigations shall be made a matter of
public record and shall be repeated as often as the Water Operator of Record
shall deem necessary.
         F.   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the
contamination or pollution of the public and consumer's potable water system.
         G.   The Water Operator of Record, or his or her duly authorized
representative, shall have the right to enter, at any reasonable time, any
property served by a connection to the public water supply or distribution
system for the purpose of inspecting the piping system or systems thereof. On
demand, the owner, lessees or occupants of any property so served shall furnish
to the Water Operator of Record any information which he or she may request
regarding the piping system or systems or water use on such property. The
refusal to disclose such information, when demanded, shall, within the
discretion of the Water Operator of Record, be deemed evidence of the presence
of improper connections as provided in this section.
         H.   The Water Operator of Record is hereby authorized and directed to
discontinue, after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the water service
to any property wherein any connection in violation of the provisions of this
section is known to exist, and to take such other precautionary measures as he
or she may deem necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the
public water supply distribution mains. Water service to such a property shall
not be restored until such conditions have been eliminated or corrected in
compliance with the provisions of this section.

without the Village, are served by a connection, either directly or indirectly,
to the Village sanitary sewerage system, including the sewage treatment works.
The proceeds of such charges or rentals so derived shall be for the use of the
sewerage system and sewage treatment works of the Village, as hereinafter
provided.
(Ord. 692. Passed 4-6-65.)
   (b)   Definitions. As used in this section:

lavatories, sinks, bathtubs, showers and household laundries.
      (2)   "Industrial waste" means the liquid waste resulting from any
commercial, manufacturing or industrial operation or process.
   (c)   Rental Charges. For the purposes provided in this section, there is
hereby levied a sewer service charge or rental, to be paid by every person
whose lots, lands and premises are served by a connection, directly or
indirectly, to the Village sanitary sewerage system, or otherwise discharge
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either directly or
indirectly, to the Village sanitary sewerage system, payable and collectible as
hereinafter provided, and in an amount determined as follows:
      (1)   Except as herein provided, sewer service charges or rentals shall
be based on the water consumed on the premises served by a connection, directly
or indirectly, to the sanitary sewerage system, as measured by the Village
water meter used thereon. If water used on such premises is derived from a
source other than or in addition to the Municipal water supply, the measurement
or estimation and determination of the percentage of water which is self-
produced or otherwise obtained, and which is discharged into the sanitary
sewerage system, shall be made by the Village Administrator and shall be the
basis of computing the sewer service charge or rental hereinafter provided. In
case of a disagreement as to the amount, the owner or other interested party
may at his or her own expense, install and maintain a meter acceptable to the
Village Administrator.
      If premises are served both by the Village water supply and a properly
metered self-produced supply, the rates or charges shall be computed by
combining the consumption of both sources of supply.
      (2)   In any case where industrial wastes or other liquids discharged
into the sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, are not
susceptible to meter measurements, such wastes or other liquids shall be
measured or estimated in such manner as the Village Administrator shall
determine in order to establish the sewer service or rental charge therefor.
      (3)   A.   The present rate for sewer use in the Village is 55% of the
monthly water bill. From and after January 1, 2021, January 1, 2022 and January

charge for the consumption of water, as set forth in Section 1042.05.
         B.   The sewer rate(s) for outside/other sewer district(s) shall be as
determined and agreed upon by and between the Village and such districts.
            The sewer rates for ODRC, LORCO, Lorain County, and Tanglewood/
Midview shall be as follows (per 1,000 gallons):
 
User               2021  2022  2023
ODRC               $6.24 $6.49 $6.68
LORCO              $5.33 $5.54 $5.71
Lorain County      $6.86 $7.13 $7.34
Tanglewood/Midview $7.49 $7.79 $8.02
 
      (4)   If water supplied from the Village water system to large consumers
is used for such purposes that it will not be returned to the sanitary sewerage
system, that portion not returned shall be exempt from the sewer service or
rental charge, provided the user, at his or her own expense, furnishes,
installs and maintains suitable metering devices, acceptable to the Village
Administrator for the determination of the same.
   (d)   Payment. The charge or rental provided for in this section shall be
payable monthly at such office as the Village shall designate, shall be billed
as a separate item on the quarterly utility bill and shall cover the same
period as the water bill in the district in which the property is located. If a
sewer user does not obtain his or her water from the Village, he or she shall
be billed separately, at the same time and for the same period as water bills
are rendered in the district in which the property is located.
   For any lot, parcel of land, building or premises now discharging sanitary
sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the Village's sewerage
system, either directly or indirectly, the sewer service charge or rental shall
begin with the first full monthly period in the district in which the property
is located after the date upon which this section becomes effective.
   (e)   Rules and Regulations. Council is hereby authorized to collect the
sewer service charges or rentals, to appoint the necessary officers and agents
for such purposes and to make rules and regulations for the collection,
rebating and refunding of sewer service charges and rentals hereinbefore
provided for. Such rules and regulations shall include provisions that no user
of the Village water service may pay a monthly sewer service charge or rental
unless he or she also pays his or her water bill for the same period, and that
no user of the Village sewer service may pay a monthly water charge unless he
or she also pays his or her sewer service charge or rental bill for the same
period. Such rules and regulations shall further provide that the water service
to any premises for which water and/or sewer charges become delinquent may be
discontinued until the delinquent bill has been paid. Such rules and
regulations shall have the same force and effect as ordinances when not
repugnant thereto or to the Constitution or laws of the State.

1045.05   INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER MONITORING AND REPORTING.
   (a)   Discharge Reports of SIUs.
      (1)   Every significant industrial user (SIU) shall file a periodic
discharge report at such intervals as are designated by the Superintendent. The
Superintendent may require any other industrial users discharging or proposing
to discharge into the treatment system to file such periodic reports.
      (2)   The discharge report shall include, but, at the discretion of the
Superintendent shall not be limited to, nature of process, volume, rates of
flow, mass emission rate, production quantities, hours of operation,
concentrations of controlled pollutants or other information which relates to
the generation of waste. Such report may also include the chemical constituents
and quantity of liquid material stored on site even though they are not
normally discharged. In addition to discharge reports, the Superintendent may
require information in the form of self-monitoring reports.
      (3)   IDP discharger shall submit to the Village a copy of the Ohio EPA's
required monthly report for IDPs. Holders of IDPs shall also report any other
data as deemed necessary by the Village.
   (b)   Records and Monitoring.
      (1)   All industrial users who discharge or propose to discharge
wastewaters to the wastewater treatment system shall maintain such records of
production and related factors, effluent flows, and pollutant amounts or
concentrations as are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements
of this chapter and any applicable State or Federal pretreatment standards or
requirements.
      (2)   Such records shall be made available upon request by the
Superintendent. All such records relating to compliance with pretreatment
standards and shall be made available to officials of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency upon demand. A summary of such data indicating the industrial
user's compliance with this chapter shall be prepared as requested and
submitted to the Superintendent.
      (3)   The owner or operator of any premises or facility discharging
industrial wastes into the system shall install at his own cost and expense
suitable control manholes or access points and monitoring equipment to
facilitate the accurate observation, sampling, and measurement of wastes. Such
equipment shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and
accessible at all times. Sampling methods, location, times, durations, and
frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis subject to approval by
the Superintendent.
      (4)   Wastewater volume determination. The volume of flow used for
computing industrial waste surcharges shall be the metered water consumption of
the business except as herein provided in this subsection.
         A.   If the business discharging industrial wastes into the public
sewers procures any part, or all, of this water from sources other than a
metered public water system, all or part of which is discharged into the public
sewer, the business shall install and maintain at his expense water meters of a
type approved by the Engineer or Superintendent for the purpose of determining
the volume of water obtained from those other sources.
         B.   Access to those meters shall be made available to representatives
of the Village at any reasonable time.
         C.   The accuracy of said meters shall be verified at the discharger's
expense on a once per two year basis at a minimum or at the request of the
Superintendent, by an independent testing company.
         D.   The discharger of industrial wastes into the public sewers may
install and maintain at his expense metering devices for determining the volume
of waste being discharged to the public sewer, from which the industrial waste
surcharge would be computed. The measuring devices shall be of a type
acceptable to the Engineer or Superintendent.
         E.   The Engineer or Superintendent may require the installation of
devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged if these volumes cannot
otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records.
         F.   Any metering device for determining the volume of waste
discharged to the public sewer shall be installed, owned, and maintained by the
person responsible for its discharge following approval and installation. Such
meters may not be removed without the consent of the Engineer or
Superintendent.
      (5)   The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the
industrial user's premises outside of the building. When such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the Superintendent may
allow such facility to be constructed in the public agency having jurisdiction
over such street or sidewalk, and located so that it will not be obstructed by
public utilities, landscaping, or parked vehicles.
      (6)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the Superintendent's
requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications.
   (c)   Inspection, Sampling, and Analysis.
      (1)   Compliance determination. Compliance determinations with respect to
Section 1045.02 prohibitions and limitations may be made on the basis of either
instantaneous grab samples or composite samples of wastewater.
         A.   Composite samples may be taken over a twenty-four hour period, or
over a longer or shorter time span, as determined necessary by the
Superintendent to meet the needs of specific circumstances.
         B.   Sampling and monitoring. Industrial wastes discharged into the
public sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection with a determination of
character and concentration of said wastes. The determination shall be made as
often as may be deemed necessary by the Engineer or Superintendent but in no
case less than two twenty-four hour composite samples per month. The owner
shall be responsible for the collection and testing of the aforementioned
samples.
         C.   Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be
representative of the composition of the wastes. The sampling shall be
accomplished by the use of automatic sampling equipment capable of collecting
composite samples. Access to sampling locations shall be granted to the
Engineer or his authorized representative at all times. Every care shall be
exercised in the collection of samples to insure their preservation in state
comparable to that at the time the same was taken.
      (2)   Analysis of industrial wastewaters. Laboratory analysis for
industrial wastewater samples shall be performed in accordance with the current
edition of Standard Methods or the "Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and
Waste" published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
         A.   Analysis of those pollutants not covered by these publications
shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the State
Environmental Protection Agency.
         B.   However, alternative methods for certain analysis of industrial
wastes may be used subject to mutual agreement between the Superintendent and
the person responsible for its discharge.
         C.   Determinations of the character and concentration of the
industrial wastes shall be made by the person, or his qualified representative,
as approved by the Engineer or Superintendent.
         D.   The results of the analysis, shall be reported to the Village on
a monthly basis on forms provided by the Village, except for an IDP business in
which it has its own Ohio EPA reporting form.
         E.   The Village shall make its own analysis on the wastes and these
determinations shall be binding as a basis for monetary charges, except under
circumstances in the following paragraph F. Testing standards shall comply with
Federal Law 40 CFR 136.
         F.   In case the analysis performed by the industry and the Village
result in substantially different values, an effort shall be made by the
industry to collect samples at the same time the Village collects its own
samples. The results of the analysis on the samples collected by the Village
and the industry shall be compared using the same testing procedures as
outlined in the latest edition of "Standards Methods" and the differences
negotiated.
(Ord. 13-032. Passed 11-5-13.)
1045.06   SEWER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing for the cost of the management,
maintenance, operation and repair of the sewerage system and sewage pumping,
treatment and disposal works, and for the enlargement or replacement of the
system and works, and for the construction and reconstruction of main and
interceptor sewers and the payment of interest on any debt incurred for the
construction thereof, there is hereby levied and assessed upon each lot or
parcel of land within or without the Village on which a building, commercial,
industrial, institutional, or residential is located, which is connected to the
Village sewer system to commence and be collected monthly in advance at such
time that the Village notifies users to connect to the system, a sewer service
charge as hereinafter provided. All classes of users shall be levied charges on
the same basis as described hereinafter.
   (b)   The service charge shall be calculated on the volume of wastewater
discharged directly or indirectly into the sewage system and shall be measured
by the water used by each sewer user as shown by the water meter readings. The
rates for sewer use for residents within Grafton presently is fifty-five
percent of the monthly water bill (2012).
      (1)   This percentage rate may be changed in the future whenever the
appropriate ordinances are amended establishing new water and/or sewer rates.
   (c)   The sewer rental charges for non-residents of Grafton that are users
whose property served by the Grafton sewer system are located outside the
corporate limits of Grafton shall pay the rate established and approved prior
to receiving wastes and levied to equalize local capital costs by the Village.
      (1)   This rate has been determined by the Village and is documented in
another ordinance.
   (d)   Where a private water supply is used and/or the user desires to meter
his water use or sewage flow, the owner shall incur all expenses related to the
installation of said meter. Prior to installation of the meter, the type of
equipment installed and its location must be approved by the Village. Prior to
placing said meter into use after installation, the Village shall inspect and
approve the meter installation. Any modifications required by the Village shall
be made at the user's expense and prior to the meter's use. The meter shall be
located in a suitable location that will accommodate readings by Village
personnel. Tampering with the meter by the user to cause inaccurate reading
shall make the user subject to the penalty provisions of Section
1045.12.
   (e)   The rate for sewer use will be audited annually by the Village with
the rates being adjusted upwards or downwards in order to assure that the
system is and will continue to be self sufficient and that sufficient revenue
is being generated from each user class in proper proportions. No free service
shall be provided in this service charge system. Each user will be notified by
the Village, at least annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the
rates for that year and that portion of the service charges which are
attributable to the user charge for operation, maintenance and replacement of
the system. In addition, rates will be reviewed and adjusted accordingly to
compensate users of each class for any overages and underages accumulated
during the previous rate period.
   (f)   Rate of sewer use established by appropriate ordinances shall apply to
wastes not exceeding normal concentrations as follows:
      (1)   BOD - 200 milligrams per liter (mg/l);
      (2)   Suspended solids (TSS) - 240 mg/l;
      (3)   Phosphorus (P) - 10 mg/l;
      (4)   Oil and Grease (O & G) - 20 mg/l; and
      (5)   Ammonia (NH3) - 20 mg/l.
   (g)   In addition to the base service charge rate, wastewater from
dischargers containing pollutants in excess of normal concentrations (high
strength wastewater), as indicated in subsection (f) above shall be subject to
the following alternatives:
      (1)   Subject to prohibition of discharge to POTW.
      (2)   Subject to owner's pretreatment prior to discharge from business.
      (3)   Permitted to discharge to POTW without pretreatment while being
subject to a surcharge fee.
         A.   The surcharge rates for high strength wastewater shall be
determined annually by the Village using the following parameters:
            1.   Determine annual operational and maintenance expenses for the
wastewater collection and treatment system, excluding those expenses attributed
to debt retirement.
            2.   Determine annual pounds of BOD, TSS, P, O & G, and NH3 being
received at WWTP.
            3.   Surcharge rates will be calculated by determining the pounds
of excess pollutant multiplied by the cost per pound of pollutant.
               a.   (Total Cost ÷ # BOD) x # BOD over 200 mg/l
               b.   (Total Cost ÷ # TSS) x # TSS over 240 mg/l
               c.   (Total Cost ÷ # P) x # P over 10 mg/l
               d.   (Total Cost ÷ O&G) x # O&G over 20 mg/l
               e.   (Total Cost ÷ NH3) x # NH3 over 20 mg/l
   (h)   The Village shall determine which of these aforementioned alternatives
shall apply.
   (i)   The Village shall adopt other charges and fees which may include the
following:
      (1)   Fees for monitoring, inspections, and surveillance procedures.
      (2)   Fees for filing appeals.

shall be applied to the total kWh billed for all electric customers, including
private outdoor lighting service customers, for the meter reading period that
the Village determines as most nearly corresponding to the three-month period
used to determine the adjustment.
      (2)   Base power supply costs. The rates and charges set forth in the
Village's rate schedules are based upon the cost of the Village's power supply
requirements as furnished by American Municipal Power - Ohio. The base power
supply cost included in the Village's rate schedules is $0.079273 per kWh.
      (3)   Monthly determination of power supply cost adjustment. Each month
the Village's power supply cost adjustment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   The Village's running three-month average power supply cost per
kWh shall be determined to six decimal places by dividing:
            1.   The sum of the previous two and current months' total power
supply costs from all suppliers, plus the sum of the previous two and current
months' costs associated with ownership and operation of generating facilities
owned in whole or in part by the Village, plus the sum of the previous two and
current months' transmission- related charges and AMP service fees, plus the
sum of the previous two and current months’ total operating and maintenance
costs associated with supplying electric distribution materials by
            2.   The total energy delivered to the Village in the previous two
months and current month.
         B.   The base power supply cost of $0.079273 per kWh shall be
subtracted from the running 12-month average power supply cost determined in
division (e)(3)A. above.
         C.   The power supply cost adjustment per kWh shall be determined by
multiplying the differential in division (e)(3)B. by 1.10 to compensate for the
Village's distribution system energy losses. The result should then be rounded
to the nearest 0.10 mill ($0.0001) per kWh.
   (f)   Excise (Kilowatt-Hour) Tax Adjustment. The Village's current electric
rate schedules are hereby modified to include the following provision for all

meet the requirements of the federal Clean Water Act.
   (oo)   "Wetland" means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface or
ground-water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under
normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted
for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps,
marshes, bogs, and similar areas.
   (pp)   "Total maximum daily loads (TMDL)" is the calculation of the maximum
amount of a pollutant allowed to enter a waterbody so that the waterbody will
meet and continue to meet water quality standards for that particular
pollutant. A TMDL determines a pollutant reduction target and allocates load
reductions necessary to the source(s) of the pollutant.
   (qq)   "Total phosphorus (TP)" is an essential nutrient for plants and
animals. It is naturally limited in most freshwater systems because it is not
as abundant as carbon and nitrogen; introducing a small amount of additional
phosphorus into a waterway can have adverse effects. Sources of phosphorus
include soil and rocks, wastewater treatment plants, runoff from fertilized
lawns and cropland, runoff from animal manure storage areas, disturbed land
areas, drained wetlands, water treatment, decomposition of organic matter, and
commercial cleaning preparations. The addition of even a small amount of
phosphorus to a water body can have negative consequences for water quality.
Those adverse effects include algae blooms, accelerated plant growth, and low
dissolved oxygen from the decomposition of additional vegetation.

elects to do so, it can be recorded on the records of the subject property and/
or properties with the County Recorder of Lorain County.

Village shall not create a right in other property owners regarding a similar
application. The number of applications that may be approved in any year shall

Council, the availability of Village works for construction of the project, the
review of each application by the Village Engineer, and the discretion of the

(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63.)
1210.02   INTERPRETATION AND PURPOSE.
   In their interpretation and application, these Subdivision Regulations shall
be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the protection of the public
health, safety and welfare. To protect the public, among other purposes, these
Regulations are intended to provide for a permanently wholesome community
environment, adequate Municipal services and safe streets.
(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63.)
1210.03   SCOPE; CONFLICT OF LAWS.
   These Subdivision Regulations shall not apply to any lot forming a part of a
subdivision created and recorded prior to the effective date of these
Regulations (Ordinance 650, passed March 19, 1963), nor is it intended by these
Regulations to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way impair or interfere with
existing laws or ordinances, except those specifically repealed by these
Regulations; with private restrictions placed upon property by deed, covenant
or other private agreement; or with restrictive covenants running with the land
to which the Village is a party. Where these Regulations impose a greater
restriction upon land than is imposed or required by an existing law,
ordinance, contract or deed, these Regulations shall control.
(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63.)
1210.04   CONFORMITY REQUIRED.
   Except as provided in these Subdivision Regulations, no person shall

1210.05   ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY FOR STREETS.
   Where, in order to comply with requirements of the Planning Commission, it
is necessary to acquire property for a street outside of the boundaries of the
land to be subdivided, the land required for the street may be acquired by the
Village, but the expense thereof shall be borne by the owner of the
subdivision.
(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63.)
1210.06   PROVISION OF SERVICES BY VILLAGE.
   If it is found, upon inspection, that any improvement being installed and
constructed, or upon completion, is not in accordance with the plans,
specifications or plat in the form it was approved, the responsibility of the
Village to provide services and utilities shall cease.
(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63.)
1210.07   MORATORIUM ON RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISION CONSTRUCTION.
   (a)   Until the Village sewage treatment plant and the water supply system
have been improved and extended to a degree satisfactory to Council, a
moratorium is hereby established banning all residential subdivision
construction in the Village in areas which are presently not improved with
water and sewer utilities, and where assessments for such improvements have not
been levied.
   (b)   The Mayor and the Building Inspector are hereby authorized to deny any
application for residential subdivision development on such lands as described
in division (a) of this section until further notice by Council.
   (c)   The Village Engineer is hereby authorized and directed to prepare his
or her estimate of the necessary improvements and extensions for the water and
sewer utilities of the Village, along with his or her estimate of the cost
thereof, and shall present the same to Council as soon as practical.

(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63.)
1211.06   WORK ON UNAPPROVED SUBDIVISIONS.
   No owner or agent of an owner of any land within the jurisdiction of these
Subdivision Regulations shall proceed with any work on a proposed subdivision,

prescribed in these Subdivision Regulations.
(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63.)
1211.08   MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   A proposed division of a parcel of land along an existing public street, not

subdivided, shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for approval without

within seven working days after submission, approve such proposed division and,
on presentation of a conveyance of such parcel, shall stamp or inscribe the
same “Approved by the Planning Commission of the Village of Grafton: no plat
required” and have it signed by its clerk, secretary or other official as may

1211.09   VARIANCES.
   (a)   Generally. The Planning Commission may authorize a variance from these
Subdivision Regulations when, in its opinion, undue hardship may result from
strict compliance. In granting any variance, the Commission shall prescribe
only conditions that it deems necessary to or desirable for the public
interest. In making its findings, as required in divisions (a)(1) to (3) of
this section, the Commission shall take into account the nature of the proposed
use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the
proposed subdivision and the probable effect of the proposed subdivision upon
traffic conditions in the vicinity. No variance shall be granted unless the
Commission finds that:
      (1)   There are special circumstances or conditions affecting such
property such that the strict application of these Regulations would deprive
the applicant of the reasonable use of his or her land.
      (2)   The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right of the petitioner.
      (3)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property in the territory in which such property
is situated.
   (b)   Complete Neighborhoods. The Commission may authorize a variance from
these Regulations in case of a plan for a complete community or neighborhood
which, in the judgment of the Commission, provides adequate public spaces and
includes provisions for efficient circulation, light and air and other needs.
In making its findings, as required in divisions (b)(1) and (2) of this
section, the Commission shall take into account the nature of the proposed use
of land, the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to
reside or work in the proposed subdivision and the probable effect of the
proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. No variance shall
be granted unless the Commission finds that:
      (1)   The proposed project will constitute a desirable and stable
community development.
      (2)   The proposed project will be in harmony with adjacent areas.
   (c)   Applications.
      (1)   Generally. An application for a variance described in division (a)
of this section shall be submitted in writing by the subdivider when a
preliminary plat is filed for the consideration of the Commission. The petition
shall state fully the grounds for the application and the facts relied upon by
the petitioner.
      (2)   Complete neighborhoods. An application for a variance described in
division (b) of this section shall be made in writing by the subdivider when a
preliminary plat is filed for the consideration of the Commission. The
application shall state fully and clearly all facts relied upon by the
petitioner and shall be supplemented with maps, plans or other additional data
which may aid the Commission in the analysis of the proposed project. The plans
for such development shall include such covenants, restrictions or other legal
provisions necessary to guarantee the full achievement of the plan.
(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63.)
1211.99   PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any of the provisions of these Subdivision Regulations or
fails to comply with any order issued pursuant hereto shall be fined not less
than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000). Such sum
may be recovered with costs in a civil action brought in the County Court of
Common Pleas by the Law Director in the name of the Village and for the use
thereof.

recording of the subdivision and for the installation and approval of required
physical improvements.
(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63.)
1213.02   CONSULTATION WITH VILLAGE OFFICIALS.
   While a plan for a subdivision is still in sketch form, it is recommended
that the subdivider consult with the Village officials, including the Village
Engineer, with respect to these Subdivision Regulations, zoning provisions,
major street plan, standard specifications governing public improvements and
performance agreement and bond requirements.
(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63; Ord. 778. Passed 7-7-70.)
1213.03   PRELIMINARY PLATS.
   (a)   Contents. A preliminary plat shall show, on a map, all the facts
needed to enable the Planning Commission to determine whether or not the
proposed layout of the land in a subdivision is satisfactory from the
standpoint of public interest.
   (b)   Preparation. The preliminary plat shall be prepared by a registered
surveyor.
   (c)   Filing. The subdivider, two weeks prior to the Commission meeting at
which consideration is desired, shall file six copies of the preliminary plat.
The preliminary plat shall be considered officially filed after it is examined
by the Chairperson of the Commission and is found to be in full compliance with
these Subdivision Regulations.
   (d)   Approval.
      (1)   Recommendations. The Commission shall, within five days after the
filing of the preliminary plat, transmit copies of the plat for study and
recommendations to:
         A.   The Law Director;
         B.   The Village Engineer;
         C.   The Clerk-Treasurer; and
         D.   Such other official, body, company or agency as may be directed
by the Commission.
      (2)   Notice and hearing. The Commission shall provide an adequate
hearing and shall notify the owner of the date, time and place of such hearing.
      (3)   Time requirements. The Commission shall act on the preliminary plat
within 15 days after such hearing, unless such time is extended by agreement
with the subdivider or his or her agent, during which period the Commission
shall receive a written report, with recommendations, from each Village
official, body, company or agency enumerated in division (d)(1) of this
section.
      (4)   Reports. The Commission shall, by record vote, determine whether
the preliminary plat shall be approved, approved with modifications or
disapproved, and shall report in the following manner:
         A.   If approved, the Chairperson of the Commission shall forward its
written recommendations for approval or approval with modifications to Council.
         B.   If disapproved, the Chairperson of the Commission shall notify
the owner or subdivider to this effect, and the action of the Commission is
final unless the owner elects to appeal the adverse decision to Council.
      (5)   Action by Council.
         A.   Council shall, by record vote, approve or disapprove the
preliminary plat in the following manner:
            1.   If the Commission has recommended approval with or without
modifications, Council shall approve or disapprove the plat by a majority vote.
            2.   If the Commission has disapproved the plat and the owner has
elected to appeal, Council can only approve the plat by a three-fourths vote.
         B.   In any case, a notation of the action taken and requisite reasons
therefor shall be entered in the records of the Commission and Council.
   (e)   Effect of Approval. Approval of the preliminary plat by Council shall
not constitute final acceptance of the subdivision. Preliminary approval shall
confer upon the subdivider the right, for one year from the date of approval,
that the general terms and conditions under which the preliminary approval was
granted will not be changed.
(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63.)
1213.04   FINAL PLATS.
   (a)   Scope. A final plat shall have incorporated all changes or
modifications required by the Planning Commission; otherwise it shall conform
to the preliminary plat. It may constitute only that portion of the approved
preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to record and develop at the
time, provided that such portion conforms with these Subdivision Regulations.
   (b)   Preparation. The final plat shall be prepared by a registered
surveyor. Construction drawings and specifications for the required public
improvements shall be prepared by a registered engineer following the direction
of the Village Engineer.
   (c)   Filing.
      (1)   Required matter. After receiving notice of the action of the
Commission approving the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall proceed to file
with the Commission:
         A.   Six copies of the final plat;
         B.   Six copies of plans, profiles, cross sections and other
construction drawings and specifications related to the public improvements to
be constructed in the subdivision;
         C.   Six copies of the grading plan showing final finish grades for
all corners of building lots, final finish grades at building set- back lines
and lot lines and the driveway pattern for the subdivision;
         D.   A title guarantee or title insurance policy issued by a reputable
title company in the minimum amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000)

and
         E.   A written application for final approval.
      (2)   Time limits. The final plat shall be filed not later than one year
after the date of approval of the preliminary plat; otherwise it will be
considered void unless an extension is requested, in writing, by the
subdivider, and for good cause granted by the Commission. The final plat shall
be filed at least 12 working days prior to the meeting at which it is to be
considered. The final plat shall be considered officially filed after it is
examined by the Chairperson of the Commission and is found to be in full
compliance with these Subdivision Regulations.
   (d)   Approval.
      (1)   Recommendations. Cross-sections, profiles and other construction
drawings shall be forwarded by the Commission to the Village Engineer for his
or her study and approval. The title guarantee or title insurance policy shall
be forwarded by the Commission to the Law Director for his or her examination
and approval. The Commission shall transmit copies of the plat, for study and
recommendation, to:
         A.   The Law Director;
         B.   The Village Engineer;
         C.   The Clerk-Treasurer; and
         D.   Such other official body, company or agency as may be directed by

hearing and shall notify the owner of the date, time and place for such
hearing.
      (3)   Final tracing. After receiving a written report from each Village
official, body, company or agency enumerated in division (d)(1) of this
section, the Commission shall notify the subdivider of any recommended changes
or suggestions so that the subdivider may correct the final tracing and submit
the same for final approval.
      (4)   Time requirement. The final plat, in the form of a final tracing,
shall then be resubmitted to the Commission. The Commission shall act on the
final plat within 30 days after filing, unless such time is extended by
agreement with the subdivider or his or her agent. If no action is taken by the
Commission within such 30 days after filing, or such longer period as may have
been agreed upon, the final plat shall be deemed approved and the Chairperson
of the Commission shall comply with division (d)(5)A. of this section.
      (5)   Notice of action taken.
         A.   The Commission shall determine whether the final plat shall be
approved or disapproved and shall proceed in the following manner:
            1.   If approved, the Chairperson of the Commission shall affix his
or her signature to the plat endorsing the approval of the Commission and
showing the date when the vote was taken thereon. The plat shall then be sent
to Council for final approval.
            2.   If disapproved, the Chairperson of the Commission shall attach
to the plat a statement of the reasons for such action and return it to the
subdivider.
         B.   In either case, a notation of the action taken and the requisite
reasons therefor shall be entered in the records of the Commission.
(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63; Ord. 778. Passed 7-7-70.)
1213.05   CONSTRUCTION OF IMPROVEMENTS PRIOR TO PLAT APPROVAL; BOND.
   Before consideration of a final plat by Council, the Planning Commission
must be satisfied that all improvements required by
Chapter 1215 have been constructed in accordance with the approved plans. If it
is not desirable or possible to do all of the work herein required to place the
streets and other improvements in an acceptable condition prior to the
submission of the final plat to Council for approval, then in lieu of the
completion of the improvements, a bond executed by an acceptable surety
company, based on an estimate by the Village Engineer and approved by the Law
Director, shall be furnished by the subdivider in an amount equal to the cost
of construction of such improvements. The surety will be subject to the
condition that the improvements will be completed within 24 months after
approval of the final plat, and if they are not completed, the Village shall
proceed with the work and hold the owner and the bonding company jointly
responsible for the cost thereof. As an alternative, the subdivider may deposit
a certified check with and payable to the Village, in place of the surety bond.
The surety bond shall be held by the Village for a 12-month period after
completion of the pavement and underground improvements to provide funds to pay
for maintenance, repairs or reconstruction as deemed necessary by Council.
(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63; Ord. 778. Passed 7-7-70.)
1213.06   RECORDING OF PLATS.
   If Council finds that all requirements and conditions have been met, and if
the Law Director certifies approval of the title to land being subdivided,
Council shall approve the plat for record purposes only, without any dedication
or acceptance of streets, and shall instruct the Clerk-Treasurer to affix his
or her signature on its behalf on the plat. The plat shall then be filed by the
Law Director in the office of the County Recorder, the plat shall have a volume
and page assigned to it and the owner shall be notified of such volume and
page. The Law Director may submit the plat to a reputable title company to
comply with this section and have the title guarantee or insurance policy dated
at the time of recording of such plat.
(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63.)
1213.07   ACCEPTANCE OF STREETS.
   (a)   When these Subdivision Regulations and other ordinances and laws
applicable to a plat in question have been complied with, and when all of the
required improvements have been completed to the approval of the Village
Engineer, the owner shall request the acceptance of the streets in the
following manner:
      (1)   Endorse the dedication of streets for public use on the original
recorded plat;
      (2)   Submit the plat with dedicatory clauses to the Village Engineer;
and
      (3)   Deposit a written request with the Village Engineer for final
inspection of the street construction.
   (b)   The Village Engineer shall determine whether the streets shall be
accepted or rejected and shall report on the same in the following manner:
      (1)   If the streets are acceptable, the Village Engineer shall forward
the plat to Council with his or her written recommendation for acceptance of
the streets for public use.
      (2)   If the streets are rejected, the Village Engineer shall notify the
owner and surety company to this effect and shall report the requisite reasons
therefor. The owner shall have 60 days to make the corrections or changes
requested. If corrections or changes are not effected, the Village shall have
the work done, paying the cost of such work out of the bond required in Section
1213.05.
   (c)   If the streets are acceptable, Council shall adopt an ordinance
accepting and confirming the dedication of the streets and shall endorse its
acceptance on the original record plat. The original record plat shall be
forwarded to the Law Director for a second record on the County Map Records.
(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63; Ord. 778. Passed 7-7-70.)

1460.15(d)
1214.01   CONFORMITY WITH OFFICIAL MAP; NATURAL FEATURES.
   A proposed subdivision shall conform to the Official Map. Appropriate
treatment shall be given toward the preservation of existing views, wooded
areas, creeks and other attractive natural features of the land to be platted.
(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63.)
1214.02   STREETS.
   (a)   General Requirements.
      (1)   Conformity to Official Map. The arrangement, character, extent,
width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the Official Map and
shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to
topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and to the proposed
uses of the land to be served by such streets. Where not shown on the Official
Map, the arrangement and other design standards of streets shall conform to
this section.
      (2)   Relation to adjoining streets. The arrangement of streets in new
subdivisions shall provide for the continuation of existing streets in
adjoining areas.
      (3)   Projections. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the
arrangement of streets in a new subdivision shall make provision for the proper
projection of streets.
      (4)   Carrying of streets to property lines. When a new subdivision
adjoins unsubdivided land susceptible to being subdivided, the new streets
shall be carried to the boundaries of the tract proposed to be subdivided.
      (5)   Large tracts. Where a tract is subdivided into larger parcels than
ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for the
opening of future streets and logical further resubdivision.
      (6)   Reserve strips. Reserve strip controlling access to streets shall
be prohibited except under conditions approved by the Planning Commission.
      (7)   Half-streets. Half-streets shall be prohibited, except where
essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with
these Subdivision Regulations and where the Commission finds that it will be
practical to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided. Wherever a half-street is adjacent to a tract to be
subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract.
      (8)   Relation to adjoining property. The street arrangements shall not
be such as to cause hardship to owners of adjoining property in platting their
own land and providing convenient access to it.
      (9)   Marginal access streets.
         A.   Arterial streets on or abutting subdivisions. Where a subdivision
abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the Commission may
require marginal access streets or other such treatment as may be necessary for
adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of
through and local traffic.
         B.   Limited access highways on or abutting subdivisions. Where a
subdivision borders on or contains a limited access highway right of way, the
Commission may require a marginal access street approximately parallel to and
on each side of such right- of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate
use of the intervening lands, such as for park purposes in residential
districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the
requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.
      (10)   Collector streets. In general, provision should be made for
through or collector streets at intervals not exceeding 3,600 feet. Insofar as
practical, the street arrangement should also provide proper access to schools,
playgrounds, transportation and other community features.
      (11)   Minor streets. Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use
by through traffic will be discouraged.
      (12)   Dead-end streets or cul-de-sacs. Dead-end streets or cul-de-sacs,
designated to be so permanently, shall be not longer than 1,200 feet and shall
be provided with a turnaround at the closed end. If a dead- end street is of
temporary nature, a turnaround shall be provided at the closed end and
provision shall be made for future extension of the street into adjoining
properties.
      (13)   Alleys. Alleys shall not be permitted in residential areas.
Service roadways or other provisions for suitable access and off-street
loading, unloading and parking will generally be required in commercial,
industrial or apartment developments.
      (14)   Private streets. Private streets shall not be approved, nor shall
public improvements be approved for any private street.
      (15)   Vacation of streets. The Commission shall not recommend the
vacation of any street or part of a street dedicated for public use if such
vacation interferes with the uniformity of the existing street pattern or any
future street plan prepared for the area.
      (16)   Access to streets across ditches. The subdivider shall provide
access to all proposed streets across all ditches in a standard method approved
by the Village Engineer.
      (17)   Street names and numbers. Names of new streets shall not duplicate
existing or platted street names unless a new street is a continuation of or in
alignment with the existing or platted street. House numbers shall be assigned
in accordance with the house numbering system now in effect in the Village. All
new streets shall be named in the following manner:
 
General Direction Classification
North and south   Streets
East and west     Avenues
Diagonal          Roads
Cul-de-sacs       Courts
 
   (b)   Geometric Design.
      (1)   Intersections. The intersection of more than two streets at one
point shall be avoided, except where it is impractical to secure a proper
street system otherwise. Streets shall intersect one another at an angle as
near to a right angle as possible, and no intersections of streets at angles
less than 80 degrees shall be approved. Property lines at street intersections
shall be rounded with a radius of at least 13 feet, and curbs or edges of
street pavements shall be rounded by radii of at least 20 feet for residential
and 50 feet for industrial or major street intersections. In business
districts, the Planning Commission may permit comparable cut-offs or chords.
      (2)   Street jogs. Street jogs shall be avoided.
      (3)   Horizontal alignment.
         A.   Centerline curvature. The minimum radii of centerline curvature
shall be as follows:
 
Type of Street  Radius (feet)
Arterial        475
Collector       300
Minor           200
Marginal access 300
Cul-de-sac      100
 
         The Commission may require larger radii for arterial and collector
streets if the design of the highway is such that larger radii are necessary to
conform to the design speed.
         B.   Reverse curves. A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be
introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets. A tangent
at least 50 feet long is preferred and may be required by the Commission on
minor streets.
      (4)   Street grades. No street grade shall be less than 0.3 percent or
exceed the following, with due allowance for vertical curves:
 
Type of Street  Grade (percent)
Arterial        3
Collector       6
Minor           7
Marginal access 7
Dead-end        10
 
      The street grade at approaches to intersections shall be reduced to a
grade not exceeding 3% for a distance of at least 150 feet. The Commission may
modify this requirement when an unreasonable hardship would result from its
strict enforcement.
      (5)   Street and pavement widths. Street widths shall be not less than
the following:
 
                                                   Pavement Width (measured at
Type of Street              Dedicated Width (feet) right angles between the
                                                   faces of opposite curbs)
                                                   (feet)
Arterial                    80                     50
Collector                   60                     28
Minor, for apartments       50                     28
Minor, for other residences 50                     28
Marginal access             40                     24
Alleys                      24                     20
 
         A.   In front of areas designed and zoned, or where a petition for a
change in zoning is contemplated, for a commercial use, to permit such use the
street width shall be increased by such amount on each side as may be deemed
necessary by the Commission to ensure the free flow of through traffic without
interference by parked or parking vehicles and to provide safe parking space
for the commercial or business district.
         B.   The turnaround at the closed end of a dead-end street or cul- de-
sac shall have an outside roadway radius of at least 42 feet and a street
property line radius of at least 55 feet. The street right-of-way lines and the
radial street line of the turnaround should be joined by tangent arcs of about
a 50-foot radius. Where only single-family residences are involved, where the
street does not exceed 350 feet in length or where the dead-end street is of a
temporary nature, a “T” or “Y” type backaround terminus may be approved within
the normal right-of-way.
(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63; Ord. 778. Passed 7-7-70.)
1214.03   BLOCKS.
   (a)   Factors Governing Dimensions. Block length and width or acreage within
bounding roads shall be such as to accommodate the size of lot required in the
area by the Zoning Code and to provide for convenient access, circulation
control and safety of street traffic.
   (b)   Lengths. Block lengths should generally not exceed 1,800 feet or be
less than 400 feet. Pedestrian crosswalks may be required under certain
conditions, but should be avoided through proper block length and street design
whenever possible.
   (c)   Width. The width of a block shall normally be sufficient to allow two
tiers of lots or to provide building sites suitable to the special needs of the
type of use contemplated. The depth and width of properties laid out or
reserved for commercial and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide
for the off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use
and development contemplated. Suitable buffer and easement areas may be
required where deemed essential.
   (d)   Crosswalks. Where crosswalks are required, they shall be a minimum of
10 feet wide.
(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63.)
1214.04   LOTS.
   (a)   Dimensions. Lot dimensions and area shall be not less than the
requirements of the Zoning Code. A length to width ratio of approximately 2.5
to 1 is considered desirable for residential property. Lot depth in relation to
width shall normally not exceed a ratio of 3.5 to 1.
   (b)   Corner Lots. Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to
permit appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets. A lot
abutting on a pedestrian walkway shall be treated as a corner lot.
   (c)   Lots Served by Septic Tanks. Building sites or lots served by septic
tanks shall conform to such requirements and conditions with respect to the
area and frontage as the Planning Commission shall impose or deem necessary for
the protection of adjacent properties and the public interest. Lot areas of at
least 20,000 square feet, with at least 100 feet of frontage, will generally be
required for residential use.
   (d)   Access to Streets. The full frontage of each lot shall abut on a
publicly dedicated street or on a street that has received the legal status as
such, unless otherwise allowed by the Commission.
   (e)   Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles
to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines.
   (f)   Double and Reverse Frontage Lots. Double or reverse frontage lots
shall not be permitted except where essential to provide separation of
residential development from major streets or arteries or specific
disadvantages of topography. A planting screen easement of at least 20 feet,
across which there would be no right-of- way access, should be provided along
the lines of lots abutting such traffic arteries or other disadvantageous uses.
   (g)   Uninhabitable Lots. Lots subject to flooding and lots deemed by the
Commission to be uninhabitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy
or for other uses that may increase danger to health, life or property or
aggravate flood hazard. However, such land within a plat shall be set aside for
uses that will not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or will
not produce unsatisfactory living conditions.
   (h)   Lot Remnants. All remnants of lots below the minimum size that are
left over after subdividing a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots
rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels.
   (i)   Lot Identification. All lots shall be numbered by progressive numbers
throughout the subdivision.
   (j)   Frontage Along Railroads. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an
existing railroad, the Commission may require the subdivider to:
      (1)   So arrange his or her plat, where necessary, to permit future grade
separations at highway and railroad crossings; or
      (2)   Provide deep lots backing onto the railroad or provide, through
deed covenant, a permanent buffer strip suitable for planting or other use
compatible with the intended use of the subdivision.
(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63.)
1214.05   PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES.
   (a)   Designation on Master Plan. Where a proposed park, playground, school
or other public use shown on the Master Plan is located in whole or in part
within a subdivision, the subdivider shall dedicate or reserve adequate space
for such purpose in such area within the subdivision when the Planning
Commission finds the requirement to be reasonably necessary to the public
health and welfare.
   (b)   Acceptance of Dedications. Requiring the dedication of public spaces,
as provided in division (a) of this section, shall not constitute an acceptance
of the dedication by the Village.
(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63.)
1214.06   EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Utilities. Easements for placement of utilities shall be provided as
follows:
      (1)   On each side of all rear lot lines and along certain side lot lines
where necessary with a right-of-way width of five feet; or
      (2)   Adjacent to all public streets on private property with an easement
width of ten feet; or
      (3)   As determined necessary by the Planning Commission or Council.
   (b)   Drainage. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse,
drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement
or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such
watercourse and such further width or construction, or both, as will be
adequate for the purpose.
(Ord. 650. Passed 3-19-63; Ord. 04-008. Passed 4-6-04.)

either 8-inch thick air entrained reinforced Portland cement concrete or a
flexible type having a slag sub-base, constructed in accordance with Ohio State
Highway Department Construction and Material Specification No. 310. This sub-
base shall underlay the entire pavement as well as the curb and gutter. The
sub-base will be 4 inches thick under the curb and gutter and 6 inches thick
under the asphalt concrete pavement. It will extend beyond the back of the curb
to reach the trench of the curb back drainage. There will be a 2-inch thick
intermediate course of Ohio type 402 asphalt concrete on top of the sub-base,
between the Portland cement gutters. The 2-inch thick surface course will be
type 404 asphalt concrete. If a rigid-type pavement is installed, the sub-base
slag thickness shall be 2 inches, extending to the curb back drainage. The curb
back drainage shall be perforated asbestos cement pipe, 6 inches minimum
diameter. It shall be placed at least 3 feet below the gutter elevation
immediately behind the curbing in order to intercept ground water. The trench
shall have a slag (2 inches to 3/4-inch Railroad Ballast) or gravel backfill to
the gutter sub- base elevation. The permanent roadway in arterial or collector
streets, or in streets in commercial or industrial areas, shall be designed for
the type of traffic which they are expected to carry and the construction shall
be varied to meet the individual design. The Village Engineer will direct the
owner's engineer in this design.
   (b)   Curbs and Gutters. All streets shall be provided with curbs and
gutters of Portland cement concrete of the integral rolled type unit, not less
than 18 inches in overall width and not less than 6 inches thick where the curb

installed by the owner, at his or her own cost, and each lot within the
subdivided area shall be provided with a connection thereto at the property
line.
   (b)   Wells; Private Supply. In a proposed subdivision, pending
accessibility of a public water supply, the owner may be required to construct
wells or a private water supply system in such manner that an adequate supply
of potable water will be available to every lot in the subdivision at the time
improvements are erected thereon. The adequacy, healthfulness and potableness
of the water supply shall be subject to the approval of the State Health
Department. The Village Engineer shall determine the amount of elevated water

   (b)   Nonaccessible Public Sewers. Where a public sanitary sewerage system
is not reasonably accessible, but where plans for the installation of sanitary
sewers in the vicinity of a subdivision have been prepared by the Village
Engineer, the owner shall be required to install sewers in conformity with such
plans. In such cases, until a connection can be made with the public sewerage
system, the use of a sewage treatment plant, constructed at the owner's expense
on land owned by him or her, will be permitted, provided such disposal
facilities are approved by the State Health Department and the Village
Engineer.

exceed an infiltration or exfiltration test of 100 gallons per inch diameter
for 24 hours per mile of pipe.
   (d)   Septic Tanks. In general, septic tanks will not be permitted. However,
in small subdivisions, where all lots front on existing streets and where no
public sanitary sewerage system is accessible or liable to be accessible for an
indefinite period of time, the Planning Commission may approve the use of
septic tanks, provided:
      (1)   The subdivider must give assurance that septic tank permits can be
obtained from the County Board of Health for each lot; and

its duties.
   (d)   The Board shall become familiar with the community goals, desires, and
policies as expressed in an adopted Comprehensive Plan and the proposals set
forth therein. All decisions shall be guided by such Plan and relief only
granted which will insure that the goals and policies of the Plan will be
preserved, substantial justice is done, and the public interest is protected.
Through the performance of its duties, the Board may not act as a legislative
body; or through interpretation, the granting of variances, or the setting of
conditions, alter the basic intent of the Zoning Code to be generally and
equally applicable to all persons covered by a zoning district.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1246.04   JURISDICTION AND POWERS.
   The Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall operate so as to carry into
effect the powers and jurisdiction conferred upon it as follows:
   (a)   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any
order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Responsible
Authority in the enforcement of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   To hear and decide upon application for variances under the terms
provided in this Code.
   (c)   To interpret the provisions of the Zoning Code or Zoning Map where
there is doubt as to meaning or application. The Board shall have the specific
power to:
      (1)   Interpret the precise location of the boundary lines between zoning
districts.
      (2)   Interpret the classification of a use which is not specifically
mentioned as a part of the use regulations of any zoning district so that it
conforms to a comparable conditionally permitted, permitted, or prohibited use
in accordance with the intent and purpose of each district.
   (d)   To hear and decide whether or not a nonconforming use should be
granted extensions, additions, or reconstruction (in case of a 50% or more
loss), or change in use to another nonconforming use.
   (e)   To exercise such other powers as may be granted to the Board by this
Zoning Code, amendment thereto, or by the general laws as set forth in the Ohio
Revised Code as amended.
   (f)   The Board shall not have the power to alter or change the zoning
district classification of any property, nor to make any change in the terms or
intent of this Zoning Code, but does have power to act on those matters where
the Zoning Code provides for judicial review, interpretation, or variance
requests as defined in this chapter.
   (g)   Grant variances from the strict application of the provisions of the
sign code, as set forth in
Chapter 1288, in regard to an existing nonconforming sign or a new sign to be
installed, erected, constructed or painted, if the Board finds that requiring
strict compliance with the sign code may impose an undue hardship and that the
granting of the variance will not depreciate or damage neighboring property,
will not create a safety hazard and will not be contrary to the requirements of
the sign code.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1246.05   PROCEDURE AND REQUIREMENTS FOR APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   Appeals and variances shall conform to the procedures and requirements of

(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)

   (a)   Appeals. Appeals to the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals
concerning interpretation or administration of this Zoning Code may be taken by

of the Village affected by any decision of the Responsible Authority. Such
appeal shall be taken within 20 days after the decision by filing with the
Responsible Authority and with the Board a notice of appeal specifying the
grounds upon which the appeal is being taken. The Responsible Authority shall
transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the
action appealed from was taken.
   (b)   Fees. See Section
1242.11.
   (c)   Stay of Proceedings. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of
the action appealed from, unless the Responsible Authority from whom the appeal
is taken certifies to the Board after the notice of appeal is filed with him or
her, that by reason of facts stated in the application, a stay would, in his or
her opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case,
proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be
granted by the Board or by a court of record on application, with a written
notice to the Responsible Authority from whom the appeal is taken.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1246.07   APPLICATION AND STANDARDS FOR VARIANCES.
   A variance from the terms of this Zoning Code shall not be granted by the
Board of Zoning and Building Appeals unless and until a written application for
a variance is submitted to the Responsible Authority and the Board, containing:
   (a)   Name, address, and phone number of applicants.
   (b)   Legal description of property.
   (c)   Description of nature of variance requested.
   (d)   A narrative statement demonstrating that the requested variance
conforms to the following standards: That special conditions and circumstances
exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which
are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same
district.
      (1)   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this Zoning Code
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this Code.
      (2)   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant.
      (3)   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Zoning Code, to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1246.08   REQUIREMENTS FOR GRANTING VARIANCES.
   (a)   Variances may be granted by the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals
where the strict application of any provision of this Zoning Code would result
in peculiar and exceptional difficulties or undue hardship to the property
owner. A request for a variance may be made to the Board through the
Responsible Authority by an aggrieved property owner.
   (b)   A variance from the provisions or requirements of this Zoning Code
shall not be authorized by the Board unless it finds that all the following
facts and conditions exist:
      (1)   That unnecessary hardships would result from the literal
enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Code. Alleged hardships, such as
theoretical loss or limited possibilities of economic advantage, shall not be
considered real hardships. A hardship based on conditions created by the owner
shall not be considered a sufficient hardship for the granting of a variance.
It must be demonstrated that peculiar and special hardships exist which apply
only to the property in question and are separate and distinct from the general
conditions pertaining throughout the district.
      (2)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions applying
to the property in question, such as irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness
of lot size or shape, exceptional topographical, or other physical conditions.
      (3)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this Zoning Code and that authorization of a variance is,
therefore, necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
      (4)   That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment
of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same zoning
district and in the same vicinity, and that the granting of such variance will
not be injurious to persons working or residing in the neighborhood.
      (5)   That the granting of such variance will not be contrary to the
public interest (health, safety) or the intent and purpose of this Code and
other adopted plans.
      (6)   That such variance will not permit the establishment within a
district of any use other than those permitted by right within that district,
or any use for which a conditional permit is required.
      (7)   That such variance may not be construed to mean a change of use,
but shall mean only a variation or modification from the strict provisions of
this Code.
      (8)   That such variance, if granted, is the minimum modification that
will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.
      (9)   That in no instance shall a variance be considered for the
following reasons:
         A.   Presence of nonconformities in the zoning district.
         B.   Previous variances granted in the zoning district.
         C.   Uses in adjoining zoning districts.
         D.   The applicant's belief that the intended use would be permitted
upon his/her purchase of the land.
         E.   The character standing of the applicant.
         F.   Hardship being demonstrated beyond the context of zoning; for
example, economics.
   (c)   Variations to nonconforming uses and buildings: The Board shall have
no powers to authorize, as a variance, the establishment of a nonconforming use
or extensions of or changes in nonconforming uses. Regulation of existing
nonconforming uses are provided for in
Chapter 1252.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1246.09   CONDITIONS IMPOSED.
   The Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall have the power to impose
additional conditions and safeguards other than those stated in the Zoning Code
when granting variances. Such additional conditions shall be reasonable and
necessary to promote and preserve the public safety, general welfare, and
economic viability of the neighborhood and community, and shall be imposed
solely for the purpose of minimizing the effect of the variance on surrounding
property and the community as a whole. Violations of such conditions and
safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted,

only on appeal from the decision of the Responsible Authority, and that
recourse from the decision of the Board shall be to the courts as provided by
Section
1246.16 and Ohio R.C. Ch.713. It is further the intent of this Zoning Code that
the duties of Council in connection with this chapter shall not include hearing
and deciding questions of interpretation and enforcement that may arise; these
being the powers of the Board. Under this Zoning Code, Council shall have only
the duties of considering, adopting, or rejecting proposed amendments or the
repeal of all or part of this Zoning Code, as provided by law and of
establishing a schedule of fees and charges. If in the course of carrying out
the intent of this chapter, and after review of all appeal cases brought before
it, the Board finds a series of similar irregularities or inequities, it shall
be incumbent upon the Board to inform Council and the Planning Commission of
these inadequacies in order that the Zoning Code or Zoning Map may be
appropriately amended. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent a member of
Council from appealing the decision of the Zoning Board in a court of law.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1246.16   APPEAL TO COURTS.
   A person aggrieved by a decision of the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals

(Ord. 18-003. Passed 3-20-18.)
1248.02   PROCEDURE FOR SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   Formal submission and approval of a site plan is required before any zoning
permit may be issued. Submission and approval of a site plan includes following
the review procedures and submission requirements defined herein. An applicant
seeking site plan approval shall follow the preliminary and final review
process for site plan review as defined in this chapter. For developments also
requiring conditional use approval, the procedure established in
Chapter 1250 shall be followed. The Planning Commission and/or Village Council
may concurrently address the issue of site plan approval and consider a
recommendation on a conditional use approval, and in such case, the approval of
the site plan shall be contingent upon conditional use approval.
If a variance is required, the applicant shall be required to seek a variance
in accordance with
Chapter 1246 before submitting plans for formal site plan approval in
accordance with this chapter.
   (a)   Optional Concept Review. At any time prior to the formal submission
and review of a site plan, an applicant may engage the Planning Commission and/
or Council in an optional concept review process. In order to receive this
review, the applicant shall submit a sketch site plan to the Planning
Commission and/or Council. The applicant shall be required to submit the sketch
plan at least 14 days before the next scheduled monthly meeting in order to be
placed on the agenda for review. The purpose of such a sketch site plan is to
provide an opportunity to conceptually discuss a proposed development, and to
provide general guidance to assist in the preparation of a formal site plan.
There are no applied standards to the site sketch plan. However, the applicant
is encouraged to provide enough detail in order to be able to accurately
represent the concept. All comments and suggestions shall be considered
informal by the applicant and shall not be a binding agreement with the
Planning Commission and/or Council for approval. This concept review is a
service provided to benefit the applicant, and formal site plan approval is
dependent upon the outcome of the preliminary plan review and final site plan
review described herein.
   (b)   Preliminary Plan Review. The applicant shall be required to submit a
plan for preliminary site plan review. In order for the application to be
deemed complete, the application form, application fees, and 12 copies of the
plan shall be submitted to the Responsible Authority at least 14 days before
the next regularly scheduled monthly meeting in order to be considered for
placement on the agenda for review. If the applicant fails to provide a
complete application as described herein, the Responsible Authority shall
notify the applicant promptly of the missing items. An additional fee may be
required to defray the expenses associated with the Village review of the
plans, including the need to retain a registered professional engineer,
architect, or landscape architect, or other professional consultant to advise
the Village on any or all aspects of the site plan.
      (1)   Required information. A site plan shall be prepared at a scale of 1
inch equals 20 feet (developments more than 5 acres may be drawn at a scale of
1 inch equals 50 feet), on standard 24-inch by 36-inch sheets, with narrative
on 81/2-inch by 11-inch sheets as necessary. All site plans shall be prepared
by a registered professional engineer, architect, or landscape architect.
Minimum information to be provided in the site plan drawing includes:
         A.   The location of the proposed development in relation to existing
community facilities, thoroughfares, and other transportation modes, shopping
centers, manufacturing establishments, residential development; and existing
natural features such as vegetation, general soil conditions, and topography in
the neighboring area.

         H.   Name, address, phone number, and fax number of all applicants and
their representatives.
         I.   Adjoining land uses and zoning.
      (2)   Responsible Authority review. The Responsible Authority shall
review the application for compliance to all applicable sections of this Zoning
Code, based on the information provided in the application. If the Responsible
Authority finds that the plan will not comply with this Zoning Code, the
Responsible Authority shall notify the applicant of the discrepancies of the
site plan. If the applicant disagrees with the Responsible Authority's decision
or chooses to seek a variance, he or she can appeal to the Board of Zoning and
Building Appeals for such relief, as described in
Chapter 1246 as a separate process. Submission of the preliminary site plan to
the Planning Commission shall not be permitted unless the Responsible Authority
determines that the plans are in compliance with this ordinance, or an appeal
or variance has been granted from the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Planning Commission/Village Council review. The Responsible
Authority shall forward the preliminary application to the Planning Commission
for review and discussion, after determining that the application is complete
and the applicant complies with this Zoning Code, based on the information
required and provided at this stage of review. Within 60 days of receipt of the
preliminary application and plan from the Responsible Authority, the Planning
Commission shall meet and shall consider the proposed site plan and make a
recommendation to Council according to the following criteria:

1248.03   ACCESS CONTROL REQUIREMENTS.
   General standards for parking areas, circulation, and access shall be
incorporated as part of the site plan, as set forth in
Chapter 1290. As part of the site plan review process, access shall be reviewed
relative to the distance from other drive approaches and from roadway
intersections. The preferred method of providing access to parcels is to
minimize or eliminate driveways by using service roads, rear access roads, or
shared driveways. The Planning Commission and/or Council may, as part of the
site plan review process, require that driveways be moved, combined, re-
aligned, or eliminated to reduce the potential for accidents.
   (a)   Conditional Approval of Driveways. As part of the site plan review
process, Council may approve a site plan with a specific driveway location,
with the condition that an agreement be first entered into between the property
owner and the Village requiring that if a service road is constructed in the
future, or if the opportunity for a shared driveway should present itself with
development of adjacent property, one or more approved driveways shall be
closed and measurements taken to utilize such service road or shared drive.
Approval of driveways may also include restrictions on turning movements,
locations, or other requirements to ensure safe and efficient traffic movement.
   (b)   Construction and Use of Service Roads. When a service road is
required, such improvement shall be constructed by the developer of the
involved property before any zoning occupancy or zoning use permit is granted.
When a service road is provided, all access to an adjacent property shall use
that service road, and no direct access to the main thoroughfare shall be
provided.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1248.04   TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY.
   A traffic impact study shall be a requirement for site plan review if the
expected trip generation of the use is 100 or more cars per hour as identified
in the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) Manual. A traffic impact study
shall be prepared by a qualified professional engineer at the developer's
expense. The traffic impact study shall investigate the feasibility and
benefits of improvements such as signals, turn lanes, driveway movement
limitations, and other relevant information to the site to protect the safety
of the traveling public. The traffic impact study shall include the following
elements:
   (a)   A description of the site and study area.
   (b)   Anticipated development of adjacent parcels.
   (c)   Trip generation and distribution, including a description of all
assumptions used to generate findings of trip distribution.
   (d)   Modal split (if applicable).
   (e)   Traffic assignment resulting from the development.
   (f)   Projected future traffic volumes.
   (g)   An assessment of the impact that would result from driveway
alternatives.
   (h)   Recommendations for site access and transportation improvements needed
to maintain traffic flow within and past the site at an acceptable and safe
level of service.
   (i)   An evaluation of the effects the proposed development will have on the
level of service and roadway capacity.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1248.05   ENFORCEMENT.
   The Village may require the posting of a bond or other similar performance
guarantee to ensure compliance with the plan and stated conditions of approval.
It may suspend any zoning permit when work is not performed as required. Site
plan approval issued under this section shall lapse within one year if a
substantial use thereof has not commenced, except for good cause.

1250.01   PURPOSE.
   It is recognized that an increasing number of new kinds of uses are
appearing daily and that many of these and some other more conventional uses
possess characteristics of such unique and special nature relative to location,
design, size, method of operation, circulation, and public facilities that each
specific use must be considered individually. These specific uses are
classified as “conditional uses” in each zoning district, and because of their
special nature, may be permitted according to procedures outlined in this
chapter.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1250.02   APPLICATION FOR A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   An application for a conditional use permit shall be filed with the
Responsible Authority by at least one owner or lessee of property for which
such conditional use is proposed. The Planning Commission, with the consent of
Council, or Council without the consent of the Planning Commission, may grant
conditional use permits for certain uses which are not permitted by right under
the Zoning Code. At a minimum, the application shall contain the following
information:
   (a)   Name, address, phone number, and fax number of applicants.
   (b)   Legal description of property.
   (c)   Description of existing use.
   (d)   Present zoning district.
   (e)   Description of proposed conditional use.
   (f)   Twelve copies of the plan (scale 1 inch = 100 feet) of the proposed
site for the conditional use showing the location of all buildings, parking and
loading area, traffic access and traffic circulation, open spaces, landscaping,
refuse and service areas, utilities, signs, yards and such other information as
the Commission or Council may require to determine if the proposed conditional
use meets the intent and requirement of this Zoning Code.
   (g)   A narrative statement evaluating the economic effects on adjoining
property; the effect of such elements as noise, glare, flashing lights, odor,
fumes, and vibration on adjoining property; a discussion of the general
compatibility with adjacent and other properties in the district; and the
relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan.
   (h)   Such other information as may be required.
   (i)   Names and addresses of all owners of record of abutting parcels.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1250.03   STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO CONDITIONAL USES.
   In addition to the specific requirements for conditionally permitted uses,
the Planning Commission and Village Council shall review the particular facts
and circumstances of each proposed use in terms of the following standards and
shall find adequate evidence showing that such use at the proposed location:
   (a)   Must be, in fact, a conditionally permitted use in the zoning district
where the permit is sought.
   (b)   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general objectives,
or with any specific objective of the Village's Comprehensive Plan and/or the
Zoning Code.
   (c)   Will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and that such use will not change the
essential character of the same area.
   (d)   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future neighboring
uses.
   (e)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services
such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures,
refuse disposal, water and sewers and schools; or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such services.
   (f)   Will not create additional requirements at public cost for public
facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic welfare of
the community.
   (g)   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment,
and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property,
or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise,
smoke, fumes, glare, or odors.
   (h)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be designed

1252.01   NONCONFORMING USES GENERALLY.
   The lawful use of a building or parcel of land existing at the time of the
adoption of this Zoning Code may be continued, although such use of a building
or parcel of land does not conform to the provisions hereof, provided no
structural alterations are made other than those ordered by an authorized
public officer to assure the safety of the building or structure and provided
further, that such extension does not displace any residence use in a residence
district. A nonconforming use may be extended, changed, or enlarged in
accordance with the provisions found in this chapter.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1252.02   NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any Residential District, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other
provisions of this Zoning Code, a single-family dwelling may be erected on any
single lot of record not less than 66 feet in width, existing at the effective
date of the adoption or amendment of this Code, provided that yard requirements
of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot
is located. A variance shall not be required for a permit unless yard
requirements are to be altered.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1252.03   STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO CHANGE OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   Any change in the use of a building or lot from a nonconforming use to
another nonconforming use shall require approval by the Board of Zoning and
Building Appeals, who shall review the particular facts and circumstances of
each change in a nonconforming use application in terms of the following
standards:
   (a)   Required Information. Adequate evidence shall be required which shows
that the following statements are true when considering changes to a
nonconforming use:
      (1)   If the change is a nonconforming use, then the proposed
nonconforming use shall have the same or less impact on the existing district
when compared to the previous nonconforming use.
      (2)   The proposed nonconforming use will be served adequately by
essential public facilities and services such as highways, streets, police and
fire protection, drainage structures, refuse disposal, water and sewers, and
schools; or that the persons or agencies responsible for the establishment of
the proposed nonconforming use or building shall be able to provide adequately
any such services.
      (3)   The proposed nonconforming use will not create excessive additional
requirements at public cost for public facilities and services and will not be
detrimental to the economic welfare of the community.
      (4)   The proposed nonconforming use will not involve uses, activities,
processes, materials, equipment, and conditions of operation that will be
detrimental to any persons, property, or the general welfare by reason of
excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, glare, flashing lights,
or odors.
      (5)   The proposed nonconforming use will have vehicular approaches to
the property which shall be designed so as not to create an interference with
traffic on surrounding public streets or roads.
      (6)   The proposed nonconforming use will not result in the destruction,
loss, or damage of a natural, scenic, or historic feature of major importance.
      (7)   Whenever a nonconforming use of a building or land has been changed
to a more restricted use, or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter
be changed to a less restricted use.
   (b)   Application for Change in Nonconforming Use or Building. An
application for a change in a nonconforming use or building shall be filed with
the Responsible Authority by at least one owner or lessee of property for which
such change is proposed. At a minimum, the application shall contain the
following information:
      (1)   Name, address, phone number, and fax number of applicants.
      (2)   Legal description of property.
      (3)   Description of the existing nonconforming feature/use of the
property.
      (4)   Present zoning district.
      (5)   Description of the proposed change to the nonconforming feature/use
of the property.
      (6)   A plan of the property showing the location of buildings, parking
and loading area, traffic access and traffic circulation, open spaces,
landscaping, refuse and service areas, utilities, signs, yards and such other
information as the Board may require to determine.
      (7)   If the change is a nonconforming building or is an extension or
enlargement of the nonconforming use, then the applicant must demonstrate that
he or she would suffer undue hardship by not being able to expand the building
as requested in the application. The applicant must also demonstrate that other
sites were sought after and/or considered, and shall prepare a statement why
another site, in which a new building could be constructed, or in which the use
proposed could conform, was not a feasible alternative.
      (8)   Such other information as may be required.
      (9)   Names and addresses of all owners of record of abutting parcels.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)

nonconforming use or building. The nonconforming use shall not be increased by
more than 10%. No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel of land occupied at the effective date of

destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the
provisions of this Code, unless the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals
approves the reconstruction in accordance with procedures in
Chapter 1246.

of water, said boundary line shall be deemed to be at the limit of the
jurisdiction of the Village, unless otherwise indicated.

1284.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Planned Unit Development District (PUD) is to achieve, to
the greatest possible degree, land development that is responsive to the
natural and environmental assets and liabilities of a given site. The PUD
provides an alternative zoning category that is intended to encourage
imaginative design of development. The PUD should be a well-integrated
development in terms of major design elements such as roads, drainage systems,
utilities, and open space. The PUD allows greater design flexibility so that
natural features may be protected and development concentrated in an innovative
and efficient manner.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1284.02   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND PUD DISTRICT DESIGNATION.
   (a)   Subsequent to the approval of the Village Council, the designation of
PUD may be applied to any existing zoning district, with the limitations
described herein. There are two types of PUDs:
      (1)   A PUD may be a predominantly residential development, in which case
it is referred to as a PUD-RS. A PUD-RS may only be applied to an existing
residential district. The tract of land proposed to be developed as a PUD-RS
must be owned, leased, or controlled by one person or single entity and must be
at least five contiguous acres in size.
      (2)   A PUD may also be a mixed-use development, referred to as a PUD-
MX. A PUD-MX may be applied to any existing nonresidential zoning district. The
tract of land proposed to be developed as a PUD- MX must be owned, leased, or
controlled by one person or single entity and must be at least five contiguous
acres in size.
      (3)   A PUD must conform to the existing comprehensive and thoroughfare
plans.
   (b)   Upon the approval of the final development plan according to this
chapter, the Official Village Zoning Map shall be amended to designate the
property “PUD-RS” or “PUD-MX.”
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1284.03   PERMITTED USES.
   The permitted uses in both the PUD-RS and PUD-MX district are as follows:
   (a)   Permitted Uses; PUD-RS. An applicant may propose to include any
mixture of permitted or conditional uses in any existing residential district.
Additionally, an applicant may propose land uses which are allowed as a
permitted use in the GB district, provided that not more than 25% of the net
acres in the development is devoted to nonresidential uses.
   (b)   Permitted Uses; PUD-MX. An applicant may propose to include any
mixture of nonresidential land uses in a proposed PUD-MX development, provided
that at least 60% of the net acres in the development are devoted to uses
permitted in the district(s) applying to the property at the time of
application. If the subject property is being annexed into the Village and no
existing zoning district is applicable, any combination of nonresidential land
uses may be proposed.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1284.04   GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   The following standards represent broad parameters under which all PUD
developments must be designed:
   (a)   Central Water and Sewer Facilities. All structures in developments
approved as a PUD must be served by central public water and sewer facilities.
No package wastewater treatment plants or separate water supply systems,
private or public shall be allowed.
   (b)   Development Layout and Design. The design and layout of all PUDs shall
display excellence in design by properly considering significant site features,
such as topography, natural drainage patterns, roadway access and circulation,
surrounding land uses, and general public welfare to result in desirable land
development. Attractive landscaped buffers shall be provided between
incompatible land uses and activities.
   (c)   Front, Side, and Rear Setback Standards for Lots. All lots located in
any PUD shall have minimum front, side, and rear setbacks as determined by
Planning Commission and Council.
   (d)   Off-Street Parking and Loading Facilities. For all land uses within
the PUD, standards set forth in
Chapter 1290 shall apply as determined to be applicable by Planning Commission
and Council.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01; Ord. 21-007. Passed 5-18-21.)
1284.05   RESIDENTIAL (PUD-RS) DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   In addition to the general development standards described in Chapter 1287,
residential PUDs shall satisfy the following development standards:
   (a)   Clustering Residential Development and Required Open Space. Clustering
residential density is encouraged to provide required common open space. A
minimum of 20% of the land developed for residential purposes in a PUD-RS plan
shall be reserved for common open space. This required amount of common space
shall be established as a contiguous common open space, under one ownership,
and provision shall be established for maintenance and care. The legal articles
relating to any organization of property owners in the development charged with
such open space maintenance shall be submitted to the Village and publicly
recorded with the County Recording Office. The Village Council may require as a
condition of final approval, any evidence deemed necessary to document that the
required common space will remain in its stated condition as long as the
development exists (including such as legal documents, deed restrictions,
conservation easements, etc.)
   (b)   Clustering Residential Density. To achieve a clustering of residential
density and to provide for the required common open space, the lot area
requirements for residential land uses may be reduced from the densities
required under the district(s) applying to the property at the time of
application as determined acceptable by Planning Commission and Council. The
lot width and yard requirements for residential lots may also be reduced as
determined by Planning Commission and Council to be needed to accommodate a
variety of structural patterns, clustering designs, and housing types.
   (c)   Residential Dwelling Types. Along with clustering residential density,
a PUD-RS may include a mixture of dwelling types including single-family
detached dwellings, two-family units, zero lot-line units, and multiple- family
units, provided the maximum density requirements of Chapter 1264 are not
exceeded.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01; Ord. 21-007. Passed 5-18-21.)
1284.06   GENERAL PUD APPROVAL PROCESS.
   The applicant for a PUD is encouraged to informally present conceptual plans
to both the Planning Commission and Village Council for review prior to
extensive engineering. Plans may include the proposal to phase construction of
the PUD development. Property proposed to be developed as a PUD must be rezoned
to PUD; and the decision to approve a final development plan and to rezone
property to PUD are done concurrently. The PUD review process must satisfy all
of the applicable requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1284.07   FINAL PLAN.
   The applicant for a PUD development shall submit 12 copies of the proposed
Final Plan to the Responsible Authority, submitting the appropriate application
fee and satisfying the following requirements:
   (a)   Final Plan.
      (1)   The final plan shall include the following:
         A.   The specific description of permitted, conditionally permitted,
and accessory uses to be allowed in each area of the development.
         B.   A copy of proposed deed restrictions.
         C.   The final plan shall be drawn to illustrate:
            1.   A survey and legal description of the proposed development
site, showing dimensions and bearings of the property lines; area in acres,
topography (at 2-foot contour intervals); and existing features of the
development site, including major wooded areas, streets, easements, utility
lines, existing land uses.
            2.   The location and dimensions of all lots, setbacks, and
building envelopes.
            3.   Conceptual drawings of sewer and water facilities, as well as
street and drainage systems.
            4.   A table indicating acreage devoted to various development
types.
            5.   Ensure that the general requirements for the final site plan
review outlined in
Chapter 1248 have been satisfied.
         D.   Landscaping plan for all buffers and other common areas.
         E.   Architectural guidelines to apply throughout the development.
         F.   The proposed names of all interior streets proposed for the
development.
         G.   Layout and dimensions of all parking and loading areas along with
an indication of what they are to be built to serve.
         H.   Any applicable phasing that will be involved with the
construction.
         I.   Subdivision's name.
      (2)   In addition to the above, the Village Council may require
additional information including environmental impact studies and
archaeological surveys prepared by appropriate professionals to document the
impacts of the development, and to address potential mitigation measures. The
applicant shall be responsible for reasonable expenses incurred by the Village
in reviewing final development plans. Such expenses are beyond application fees
established by the Village and may include professional service fees, such as
legal expenses or fees from other professionals, such as engineers, landscape
architects, planners, or environmental scientists incurred in connection with
reviewing the plans submitted.
   (b)   Final Plan and Rezoning Approval Procedure. The decision to rezone
land to PUD and to approve the final plan are accomplished concurrently. All
PUD final plat submissions are deemed to be an application for amending the
existing Zoning District in accordance with
Chapter 1244. All procedures (Planning Commission Review, public hearings, and
action by the Council), therein shall be followed in considering an application
for the rezoning of the parcel(s) in question to a PUD zone. Upon approval of
such plan and rezoning, the Village Zoning Map shall be amended to reflect the
area designated as “PUD-RS” or “PUD-MX.” Thereafter, with the concurrent
approval of the rezoning and final plat pursuant to the criteria outlined in
Chapter 1244 and
1248, all development restrictions and conditions described in the final plan
shall become official PUD requirements.
   (c)   Criteria for Approval of Final Plan. The Planning Commission and
Village Council shall review the proposed Final Plan according to the following
criteria:
      (1)   The proposed plat conforms with the general goals and objectives of
the Village's master plan.
      (2)   The proposed development promotes the general health, safety, and
welfare of the community.
      (3)   The proposed interior road system, parking, and any other off-site
improvements are adequately designed to carry anticipated traffic efficiently
within the development and surrounding areas.
      (4)   Any exception from standard district requirements can be warranted
by design and other amenities incorporated in the final development plan
according to these PUD requirements.
      (5)   The area surrounding said development can be planned and zoned in
coordination and substantial compatibility with the Village's master plan.
      (6)   The existing and proposed utilities, including water and sewer
service and drainage plan, will be adequate for the health and safety of the
population and nonresidential uses proposed in the PUD.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1284.08   AMENDMENTS AND CHANGES.
   (a)   After the final development plan has been approved by the Village
Council, adjustments or rearrangements of buildings, parking areas, entrances,
heights, or yards may be requested by the proponents. Minor changes, as defined
herein, are allowed provided such requests conform to the standards established
by the final development plan and this Zoning Code. A minor change shall
require approval by the Planning Commission, and shall include the following:
      (1)   Adjustments to the size and location of buildings, swimming pools,
and other on-site structures provided:
         A.   They do not result in an increase in the number of housing units
approved in the final plan.
         B.   They do not encroach into the established setback areas.
         C.   They do not create a larger building mass, either through an
increase in their height or length that would magnify their effect on the
adjoining areas.
      (2)   Alterations to the proposed drives and/or parking areas if they do
not encroach into building areas or specified recreation areas.
      (3)   Adjustments in the size and location of development identification
signs.
   (b)   A “major change” is any change that does not meet the criteria above
and, in addition, is one which would constitute a significant alteration in the
basic plan design or result in a use different from those originally intended.
A major change shall require submittal of a final plan, as defined in Section
1284.07, of that portion of the development proposed to undergo a major change.

access to State Route 57 shall be in accordance with the Grafton Corridor Plan.
All access permits shall be reviewed and approved by the Village.
   (b)   The approval of access as part of the site plan review process shall
be based on the goal of reducing the total number of driveways along State
Route 57. The preferred method of providing access to parcels is to reduce or
eliminate driveways by using front or rear access drives or cross access drives
with cross easements where applicable. When a service road is provided, all
access to adjacent property shall use that service road and no direct access to
State Route 57 shall be allowed, unless the Planning Commission waives this
requirement based on the recommendations made in a traffic impact study.
   (c)   A traffic impact study shall be prepared by a qualified professional
engineer at the developer's expense. The study shall also investigate the

1287.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of general district regulations is to establish additional
requirements for various uses, classifications of uses, or areas in order to
promote the harmonious exercise of property rights without conflict. The
general district regulations as set forth herein shall apply to all districts,
unless otherwise noted herein. Where the requirements of a general district
regulation and a district regulation differ, the more specific/restrictive
requirement shall prevail.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1287.02   CONVERSION OF DWELLING TO MORE UNITS.
   A residence shall not be converted to accommodate an increased number of
dwelling units unless:
   (a)   The yard dimensions continue to meet the yard dimensions required by
the Zoning Code for new structures in that district.
   (b)   The lot area per dwelling equals the lot area requirements for new
structures in that district.
   (c)   The floor area per dwelling unit is not reduced to less than that
which is required for new construction in that district.
   (d)   The conversion is otherwise in compliance with this Zoning Code (e.g.,
property is zoned for double- or multiple-family use) and all other relevant
codes and Ordinances.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1287.03   GENERAL LOT AREA REGULATIONS.
   No parcel of land shall hereafter be reduced or divided so as to provide
less than the minimum lot size required in the district in which such land is
situated.
   (a)   Minimum Lot Area. The minimum lot area without central water and sewer
services shall be one acre per family for single-family dwellings unless a
larger lot size is required by the County Health Board due to soil conditions.
   (b)   Nonconforming Existing Lot of Record. Any lot or parcel of land under
one ownership and of record at the time of adoption of this Zoning Code or any
amendment hereto, may be used as a building site even with less area or width
than that required by the regulations for the district in which located. All
applicable setbacks and other development standards shall apply to
nonconforming existing lots.
   (c)   Setback Regulations for Corner Lots. On a corner lot, the principal
building and its accessory structures shall be required to have the same
setback distance from all street right-of-way lines as required for the front
yards in the district in which the structures are located.
   (d)   Reduction of Area or Space. No lot, yard, parking area, or other space
shall be reduced in area or dimension if such reduction has the effect of
making the lot, yard, parking area, or other space less than the minimum
required by this Zoning Code. Furthermore, any lot, yard, parking area, or
other space which is already less than the required minimum shall not be
reduced further. However, nothing in this section shall be interpreted to limit
the power of the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals in properly granting
variances under this Code.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1287.04   GENERAL YARD REQUIREMENTS.
   In addition to all yard requirements specified in other sections of this
Zoning Code, the following provisions shall be used for interpretation and
clarification. Except as herein provided, every required yard shall be required
open space other than a court unoccupied and unobstructed by any structure or
portion of a structure from 3 feet above the general ground level of the graded
lot upward, provided that accessories, ornaments, and furniture may be
permitted in any yard, subject to height limitations and requirements limiting
obstruction of visibility.
   (a)   Yard Requirements for Single Buildings. No required yard or other open
space around a building shall be considered as a yard to open space for any
other building. No required yard or other required open space on an adjoining
lot shall be considered as providing the yard or open space on the lot whereon
a building is to be erected or established.
   (b)   Yard Requirements for Multiple-Family Dwellings. Multiple-family
dwellings shall be considered as one building for the purpose of determining
front, side, and rear yard requirements. The entire group as a unit shall
require one front, one rear, and two side yards as specified for dwellings in
the appropriate district, except when the dwelling unit is located on a corner
lot. Each individual building shall meet all yard requirements for the
appropriate district as though it were on an individual lot.
   (c)   Visibility at Intersections. On a corner lot at the intersection of
two streets (existing or proposed), or at the intersection of an alley and a
street within any district, nothing shall be installed, erected, placed,
planted, or allowed to grow in such manner as to impede vision materially
between a height of 2 1/2 feet and 10 feet above the center line grades of the
intersecting streets, or of the intersecting alley and street in the area
bounded by the right-of- way lines of such corner lots and a line joining
points along said street lines, or alley and street lines 60 feet from the
point of intersection.

   (d)   Accessory Buildings.
      (1)   One-story garages as accessory buildings: In existing residential
districts, 1-story detached garages or other accessory buildings may not be
located within 6 feet from any side or rear property line, and may not be
located closer than 15 feet to any principal building upon the same lot with
such garage. Additionally, such garages or accessory buildings may not be
located closer to the front building line than the principal building, unless
the garage or accessory building is attached thereto. Any accessory building on
any residential lot may not be larger than 45% of the gross floor area of the
principal use or structure and is not to exceed a maximum of 1,200 square feet.
Additionally, accessory buildings, together with the principal dwelling/
building, may not exceed lot coverage requirements for a given zoning district.
In any R-1A or R-1B Residential District, no detached garage may not exceed a
single story or 15 feet in height at any highest point, except that balconies
properly designed may be constructed in a detached private garage for storage
in connection with the use of a single-family or two-family residential
structure. No detached private garage shall exceed 26 feet in length or width
in such Residence Districts.
      (2)   Utility buildings. A utility building (shed) that is 200 square
feet or less in area under roof, does not have a permanent foundation, and is
accessory to a single family dwelling, may be constructed in the rear yard of
any zoning district provided it meets the setback, lot area, and height
requirements of the R1A Zoning District.
   (e)   Use of Front Yard. Front yards in all districts shall be landscaped
with living plant material with the exception of required driveways or required
off-street parking for single- and two-family dwellings in accordance with the
provisions of this Zoning Code. Driveways shall be permitted for multiple-
family dwellings in the front yard, however, all parking shall be located in
the side or rear yard of the lot, and the remainder of the lot shall be
landscaped with living plant material.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01; Ord. 05-040. Passed 1-17-05; Ord. 10-013. Passed
8-10-10.)
1287.05   BUILDING REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Generally. No building or other structure shall hereafter be erected
or structurally altered:
      (1)   To exceed the height required.
      (2)   To accommodate or house a greater number of families than that
permitted by the provisions of this Zoning Code.
      (3)   To occupy a greater percentage of lot area than permitted.
      (4)   To have narrower or smaller rear yards, side yards, front yards, or
lot width at the building line than those permitted in this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Principal Building per Lot. No more than one principal building or
structure may be constructed on any one lot for the purposes of this Zoning
Code unless otherwise indicated.
   (c)   Buildings under Construction Prior to Enactment of this Code or
Amendments. Nothing in this Zoning Code shall be deemed to require any change
in plans, construction, or designated uses of any building upon which actual
construction has lawfully begun prior to the adoption of this Zoning Code and
provided construction is prosecuted diligently, and provided further that such
building shall be completed within one year from the date of passage of this
Zoning Code.
   (d)   Minimum Living Area per Single Family Dwelling Units.

      (2)   One and one-half story buildings. The minimum for a single-family
dwelling shall be 768 square feet of first floor living area and a total of not
less than 1,152 square feet of living area on both floors. The floor area over
which the finished ceiling is less than 61/2 feet from the finished floor shall
not be counted in the total living area.
   (e)   Two-Story Buildings. The minimum for a single-family dwelling shall be
720 square feet of first floor living area, and a total of not less than 1,080
square feet of living area on both floors.

   (g)   Frontage Required for Building. No principal building or groups of
buildings approved by the Planning Commission shall be erected on a lot which
does not abut on a street of record.
   (h)   Temporary Buildings. The following regulations are necessary to govern
certain uses which are of a non-permanent nature. For such uses requiring a
temporary zoning permit, an application for a zoning permit shall be made to
the Responsible Authority at least seven days before the instigation of such
use. This application shall contain a graphic description of the property to be
used, a description of the proposed use, and a drawing with sufficient
information to determine the yard, setback, parking, and sanitary/water/
electric facility requirements for the proposed temporary use. The period
during which such temporary buildings are to be permitted shall be no greater
than the period of construction plus 30 days after the completion of such
construction unless noted otherwise herein. The following uses are deemed to be
temporary uses and shall be subject to the specified regulations and time
limits which follow, as well as the regulations of any district in which they
are located:
      (1)   Real estate offices containing no living accommodations shall be
permitted within any district for any new subdivision for a period of 1 year.
Two 6-month extensions may be granted if conditions warrant by the Responsible
Authority. Such offices shall be removed upon the completion of the sales of
the lots therein or upon the expiration of the zoning permit, whichever occurs
first.
      (2)   Temporary buildings, construction trailers, offices, equipment,
materials, and storage facilities required in conjunction with construction
activity may be permitted in any district for a period of 1 year. Six-month
extensions may be granted if construction is substantially underway. Such uses
shall be removed immediately upon completion of the construction or upon
expiration of the zoning permit, whichever occurs first.
      (3)   Temporary sales and services may be permitted in parking areas
within any commercial district. A zoning permit valid for a period not to
exceed 7 consecutive days shall only be issued 3 times within any 12-month
period to any individual or organization. The Responsible Authority shall not
issue a permit for such temporary use if he or she determines that it
encroaches upon more than 25% of the required parking area.
      (4)   Temporary retail sales and services such as the sale of plants,
flowers, arts and crafts, farm produce, or similar items on a lot(s) other than

and its appurtenances permitted on the roof of a building shall be set back one
foot from the edge of the roof for each foot in height of the wireless
telecommunication facility. However, this setback requirement shall not apply
to antennas that are less than 2 inches in thickness mounted to the sides of
antenna support structures and do not protrude more than 6 inches from the side
of such an antenna support structure. This requirement is subject to change by
the Village upon the review of the photo simulation provided in compliance with
division (i)(3) of this section.
      (9)   Security enclosure required. All towers and equipment shelters
shall be enclosed either completely or individually as determined by the
Village. The Village and co-locators shall have reasonable access. Fencing
shall be required, except no fence shall be required on top of a building or
other structure if access to the roof or top of the structure or building is
secure.
      (10)   Existing vegetation and buffer plantings. Existing vegetation
(trees, shrubs, etc.) shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Buffer
plantings shall be located around the perimeter of the security enclosure as
deemed appropriate by the Village. An evergreen screen may be required around
the perimeter of the property in lieu of such buffer plantings.
      (11)   Access control and emergency contact. “No Trespassing” signs shall
be posted around the wireless telecommunications facility, along with a
telephone number of who to contact in the event of an emergency.
   (d)   Co-Location Requirements.
      (1)   Jurisdiction study of potential public sites. In order to encourage
the location of a wireless telecommunication facility on publicly-owned
property, the Village shall cooperate with the entity desiring to locate a
wireless telecommunication facility in the Village to determine if it is
feasible to locate such a facility on publicly-owned property.
      (2)   Exemption from proof of co-location availability. Persons locating
a wireless telecommunication facility upon a publicly-owned property shall be
exempted from the requirements herein regarding presentation of proof that co-
location is not available. However, persons locating a wireless
telecommunication facility on publicly- owned property shall continue to be
subject to the requirements contained in division (d)(4) of this section.
      (3)   Exemption from certain requirements. Persons locating a wireless
telecommunication facility on a publicly-owned property identified by the

1288.01   PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter shall be to regulate and to coordinate the
type, placement, physical dimensions including the design, size, location,
illumination, and maintenance of signs within the Village. These regulations
shall apply to all premises regardless of the zoning category. These
regulations are intended to achieve, among others, the following purposes, to-
wit:
      (1)   To protect property values;
      (2)   To create a more attractive economic, business, and industrial
climate;
      (3)   To enhance and protect the physical appearance and preserve the
scenic and natural beauty of the Village; and
      (4)   To reduce signs or advertising distractions and provide for
uniformity of sign type and design;
      (5)   To reduce hazards that may be caused by signs overhanging or
projecting over public rights-of-way;
      (6)   To provide more open space; and
      (7)   To enhance community development.
   (b)   In establishing these objectives, the Village has determined that,
without adequate regulation and design standards, signs are a nuisance. As the
appearance of the Village is marred by the excessive number, oversized and
poorly designed signs, both residential and business property values are
adversely affected. Therefore, the number of such distracting signs ought to be
reduced and signs permitted should comply with the standards of this chapter in
order to reduce the aforementioned effects.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)

product dispensers and point of purchase displays; flags of any nation,
government, or noncommercial organization; barber poles, religious symbols;
commemorative plaques; the display of street number; or any display or
construction not defined herein as a sign. Thus, the primary intent of this
chapter shall be to regulate signs of a commercial nature intended to be viewed
from any vehicular public right-of-way.

nonconforming sign or a new sign to be installed, erected, constructed or
painted, if the Board finds that requiring strict compliance with the
provisions of the variance from the provisions of this chapter will not
depreciate or damage neighboring property, will not create a safety hazard and
will not be contrary to the purposes of this chapter. The procedure for
applying for variance and the hearing therein shall be the same as in cases

1292.01   LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS.
   Consistent with the objectives established in this chapter, landscaping
shall be provided according to the following standards for the following
districts, with the new construction, enlargement, addition, or alteration of
any principal building:
   (a)   R-3 Multiple-Family Residential District
   (b)   GB General Business District
   (c)   CB Central Business District
   (d)   PO Professional Office
   (e)   LI Light Industrial District
   (f)   GI General Industrial District
   (g)   IP Industrial Park
   (h)   ID Institutional Development District
   (i)   PUD Planned Unit Development
   (j)   SR57 State Route 57 Corridor Overlay District
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1292.02   SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
   The Village shall recognize that, in some cases, the landscaping
requirements may be difficult or impractical to meet due to specific site
characteristics. In these cases, an alternate landscaping plan may be approved
by the Planning Commission as part of the site plan review process.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1292.03   SCREENING OF SERVICE COURTS, STORAGE AREAS AND LOADING DOCKS.
   For all uses that include areas used for service, loading, and unloading
activities, such areas shall be screened along the entire rear lot line and
side lot lines from the rear lot line to the rear building line to the
following minimum standards:
   (a)   The width of the screening area shall be a minimum of 5 feet.
Screening shall consist of walls, hedges, fences, vegetation, or an acceptable
combination of these elements, provided that screening must be at least 7 feet
in height.
   (b)   Vegetation used for screening shall have a minimum opaqueness of 75%
at all times within 2 years of planting.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1292.04   SCREENING OF TRASH CONTAINER RECEPTACLES.
   Trash containers shall be screened according to the following minimum
standards:
   (a)   Trash containers designed to service more than 1 residential unit or
to service a nonresidential structure shall be screened on 3 sides by walls,
fences, or natural vegetation or an acceptable combination of these elements.
   (b)   The height of such screening shall be at least 6 feet. The maximum
height of walls and fences shall not exceed 10 feet. Vegetation shall have a
minimum opaqueness of 75% at all times within 2 years of planting. The use of
evergreen vegetation is encouraged. Vegetation shall be a variety and size that
will attain 6 feet in height within 2 years of planting.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1292.05   INTERIOR PARKING AREA LANDSCAPING.
   Landscaping within parking areas, whether ground cover or upright plant
material, is necessary not only to reduce the generation of heat and water
runoff, but to break up visually the expanse of paved areas. The use of parking
islands or peninsulas strategically placed throughout the parking lot is
required to landscape parking lot interiors. The use of shade trees in these
landscape areas is encouraged. Any open parking area containing more than 6,000
square feet or 15 or more parking spaces shall provide the following interior
landscaping in addition to the required perimeter screening:
   (a)   An area equal to 5% of the total area devoted to parking space and
parking lanes shall be landscaped and permeable.
   (b)   Whenever possible, large parking areas of 30,000 square feet or larger
shall be designed so as to break up their visual expanse and create the
appearance of smaller parking lots. This distinction or separation can be
achieved by interspersing yard space and buildings in strategic areas and by
taking advantage of natural features such as slope, existing woodland or
vegetation, drainage courses, and retention/detention areas that contain water
throughout the year.
   (c)   Landscaping in parking areas shall be dispersed throughout in
peninsulas or islands. The minimum island or peninsula size shall be 180 square
feet with a 2-foot minimum distance between all trees or shrubs and the edge of
pavement where vehicles overhang and should have a minimum width of 10 feet.
Islands shall typically be located every 10 to 12 parking spaces and may be
curbed.
   (d)   The required plant materials for the interior of parking areas shall
be 1 deciduous tree for every 3,000 square feet. Where sight distance or
maneuvering conflicts exist, trees shall have a clear trunk of at least 5 feet
above the ground, and the remaining required landscape areas shall be planted
with shrubs or ground cover not to exceed 2 feet in height.
   (e)   Areas located between any parking area and public right-of-way shall
be landscaped with elements such as mounding, trees, ground cover, and shrubs.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1292.06   PLANT MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS.
   The following sections include specifications for plant materials.
Alternatives to these materials that can be shown to meet both the intent and
requirements of this Zoning Code may be approved as part of a site plan:
   (a)   Shrubs. Shrubs shall be at least 24 inches average height and spread
at the time of planting, and, where required for screening, shall form a
continuous, year-round, solid visual screen within 5 years after planting.
   (b)   Ground Cover and Grass. Ground cover shall be planted a minimum of 8
inches on center and shall be planted in such a manner to present a finished
appearance and 75% coverage after 1 complete growing season. If approved as
part of a site plan, ground cover may also consist of rocks, pebbles, wood
chips, and other material. Grass shall be planted in species normally grown as
permanent lawns.
   (c)   Prohibited Tree Species.
      (1)   Within any required landscaping, the following tree species may not
be used:
 
Box Elder    Tree of Heaven Catalpa
Black Walnut Poplar         Willow
Mountain Ash Siberian Elm   Black Locust
Hickory      Mulberry
 
      (2)   In addition to the species listed above, trees which produce nuts,
seeds, or fruit that can create a hazard to pedestrians or vehicles, shall not
be planted in such a manner that the natural dripline of an average adult tree
of the species planted will be any closer than 3 feet of a pedestrian walkway
or parking lot.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1292.07   SCREENING OF EXTERIOR MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT.
   Exterior components of plumbing, processing, heating, cooling, and
ventilating systems, including but not limited to piping, tanks, stacks,
collectors, heating, cooling, and ventilating-equipment fans, blowers, duct
work, vents, louvers, meters, compressors, motors, incinerators, ovens, etc.,
shall not be directly visible at ground level. Any landscaping or structural
means employed to screen exterior components of plumbing, processing, heating,
cooling, and ventilating systems from direct view shall appear as integrated
parts of the buildings; shall be constructed of complementary and durable
materials; and finished in a texture and color scheme complementary to the
overall architectural design. Any exterior components of plumbing, processing,
heating, cooling, and ventilating systems, and their screening devices which
will be visible from upper floors of adjacent buildings shall be kept to a
visible minimum, shall be installed in a neat and compact fashion, and shall be
painted such a color as to allow their blending with their visual backgrounds.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1292.08   BUFFER STRIP REQUIRED.
   (a)   In all side and rear yards in the CB, GB, LI, GI, IP, ID, SR57
Overlay, and PO Districts that adjoin a residential district, there shall be a
buffer strip that is not less than 10 feet in width, and running the length of
the side and/or rear yards adjacent to the residential district.
   (b)   Required buffer strips shall consist of maintained living vegetative
material such as trees, shrubs, ornamental plants; earth mounding or fencing
made of wood that results in 100% opacity to a height of 6 feet or more within
1 year of planting.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1292.09   MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   The owner shall be responsible for maintaining all landscaping in good
condition to present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance. This should be
accomplished by the following standards:
   (a)   All plant growth in landscaped areas shall be controlled by pruning,
trimming, or other suitable methods so that plant materials do not interfere
with public utilities, restrict pedestrian or vehicular access, or otherwise
constitute a hazard.
   (b)   All planted areas shall be maintained in a weed-free condition, clear
of undesirable undergrowth; and free from refuse and debris.
   (c)   Replacement plants shall conform to the standards that govern original
installation. Dead or unhealthy plants shall be replaced within the next
planting season.
   (d)   Representatives of the Village shall have the authority to inspect
landscaping and check it against the approved plan on file.
(Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)

1294.01   PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually-oriented businesses
in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the
citizens of the Village and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to
prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually-oriented
businesses within the Village. The provisions of this chapter have neither the
purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of
any communicative materials, including sexually-oriented materials. Similarly,
it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by
adults to sexually-oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to
deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually-oriented
entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of
this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
(Ord. 00-040. Passed 11-21-00; Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1294.02   FINDINGS.
   Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on
the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the
Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v.
Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres,
426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and
on studies in other communities including but not limited to Phoenix, Arizona;
Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas;
Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California;
Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio;
and Beaumont, Texas; and also on findings from the Report of the Attorney
General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually-Oriented Businesses (June
6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Council finds:
   (a)   Sexually-oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and
unhealthy activities that are currently uncontrolled by the operators of the
establishments. Further, there is currently no mechanism to make the owners of
these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
   (b)   Certain employees of sexually-oriented businesses defined in this
chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in a higher incidence of certain
types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
   (c)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually-oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-
private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
   (d)   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which
creates unhealthy conditions.
   (e)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually- oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually-oriented businesses.
   (f)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually-oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and
shigella infections.
   (g)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative
number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) in the United States: 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983, 4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in
1985, and 253,448 through December 31, 1992.
   (h)   The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982
and 45,200 through November, 1990.
   (i)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being
reported in 1990.
   (j)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually-oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
   (k)   The findings noted above raise substantial governmental concerns.
   (l)   Sexually-oriented businesses have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
   (m)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place
the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the
sexually-oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a
heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually-
oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and
welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the Village.
It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the
actual operator of the sexually-oriented business, fully in possession and
control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
   (n)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on
premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
   (o)   Requiring licensees of sexually-oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments.
   (p)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually-
oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases.
   (q)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct that this chapter is designed to prevent or who
are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
   (r)   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted
of a sexually-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant
may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
   (s)   The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for
a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct that leads to
the transmission of sexually-transmitted diseases.
   (t)   The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of the
Village will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.
(Ord. 00-040. Passed 11-21-00; Ord. 01-014. Passed 7-17-01.)
1294.03   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Adult arcade” means any place to which the public is permitted or
invited wherein coin-operated, slug-operated, or, for any form of
consideration, electronically, electrically, or mechanically-controlled still
or motion picture machines, projectors, video or laser disc players, or other
image-producing devices are maintained to show images to five or fewer persons
per machine at any one time, and where the images so displayed are
distinguished or characterized by the depicting or describing of specified
sexual activities or specified anatomical areas.
   (b)   “Adult bookstore,” “adult novelty store,” or “adult video store” means
a commercial establishment that, as one of its principal purposes, offers for
sale or rental for any form of consideration any one or more of the following:
      (1)   Books, magazines, periodicals, or other printed matter or
photographs, films, motion pictures, video cassettes, or video reproductions,
slides, or other visual representations that are characterized by the depiction
or description of specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas; or
      (2)   Instruments, devices, or paraphernalia that are designed for use in
connection with specified sexual activities. A commercial establishment may
have other principal business purposes that do not involve the offering for
sale or rental of material depicting or describing specified sexual activities

level of soil erosion and storm water control that will minimize and abate
degradation of land and water resources and damage to public and private
property resulting from earth-disturbing activities involving one acre or more.
Reduction of storm water discharges from construction activity disturbing less
than one acre must be considered if that construction activity is part of a
larger common plan of development or sale that would disturb one acre or more.
In addition, this chapter further intends to:
   (a)   Assure that those involved in earth-disturbing activities minimize
both soil erosion and the volume and rate of storm water runoff from their
sites.
   (b)   Assure that storm water controls are incorporated into site planning
and design at the earliest possible stage and that all storm water management
practices are properly designed, constructed, and maintained.
   (c)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil and to
promptly revegetate and stabilize the site following earth-disturbing
activities.
   (d)   Encourage the construction of storm water management practices that
serve multiple purposes such as flood control, erosion control, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.

      (2)   Permanent vegetation shall not be established until a ground cover
is achieved which is mature enough to control soil erosion and will survive
severe weather conditions.
   (g)   Cut and Fill Slopes. Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion and slippage. Consideration
shall be given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, up-slope
drainage area, groundwater conditions and slope stabilization.
   (h)   Protection of Adjacent Properties/Public Right-of-Ways. Properties,
public rights-of-way, and thoroughfares adjacent to the site of an earth-
disturbing activity shall be protected from sediment deposition. This may be
accomplished by preserving a well-vegetated buffer at the perimeter of the site
whenever possible, by installing perimeter controls such as sediment barriers,
filters, dikes, sediment basins, or by a combination of such measures as
applicable.
   (i)   Sediment Control Structures.
      (1)   Erosion and sediment control practices used to satisfy the
performance standards shall meet the standards and specifications in the
current edition of Rainwater and Land Development. The engineer shall design
and implement control practices which comply with these minimum requirements.
      (2)   Sediment control structures shall be used to control erosion and
trap sediment on a site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days. Such
structures may include, but are not limited to, silt fences, storm drain inlet
protection, sediment basins and diversions or channels which direct runoff to a
sediment basin. All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding
runoff in order to be considered functional.
      (3)   Sediment control structures shall be set up within seven days from
the start of grubbing and shall be made functional before other earth-
disturbing activities take place. Earthen structures such as dams, dikes and
diversions shall be seeded and mulched as soon as the installation is complete.
Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout the course of earth-
disturbing activity and until the site is stabilized with permanent vegetation.
      (4)   Sheet flow runoff from disturbed areas of the site shall be
intercepted by silt fence or diversions. Silt fence shall be placed on a level
contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The relationship
between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is
shown in division (i)(1) of this section.
 
Schedule 1295.05(i)(1) Maximum Drainage Area for Silt Fence
Maximum drainage area (in acres) to 100 Range of slope for a particular
linear feet of silt fence               drainage area (in percent)
0.5                                     <2%
0.25                                    > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                   > 20% but < 50%
 
      (5)   Concentrated storm water runoff from denuded areas flowing at rates
that exceed the design capacity of sediment barriers shall pass through a
sediment-settling facility. The facility shall be designed according to
Rainwater and Land Development, current edition.
      (6)   Storm water diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away
from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices, which include swales,
dikes, or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to ten acres.
      (7)   A centralized sedimentation basin shall be utilized for common
drainage areas equal to or greater than ten acres.
      (8)   The Municipal Engineer may require sediment basins or traps for
smaller disturbed areas where deemed necessary.
      (9)   If the Municipal Engineer determines that site conditions do not
warrant its construction, based upon hydrological and hydraulic data, the storm
water detention requirement may be modified.
   (j)   Stabilization of Waterways and Outlets. All on-site storm water
conveyance channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected
velocity of flow. Methods adequate to minimize erosion shall also be provided
at the outlets of all pipes and paved channels.
   (k)   Storm Sewer Inlet Protection.
      (1)   Unless otherwise provided for on the approved stormwater management
plan, storm sewer inlets shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will
not enter the conveyance system without first being filtered or otherwise
treated to remove sediment, unless otherwise approved by the Municipal
Engineer.
      (2)   There shall be no sediment-laden discharges to drainage channels
resulting from dewatering activities. If any sediment-laden ground water is
encountered during trenching activities, then the sediment-laden ground water
must pass through an effective sediment control device prior to being
discharged from the construction site.
      (3)   Areas designated for the storage or disposal of solid, sanitary,
and toxic wastes, dumpsters, concrete truck washout pits, and fuel tanks shall
be shown on the storm water management (SWM) plan.
   (l)   Working in or Crossing Watercourses.
      (1)   Construction activities shall be kept out of watercourses to the
maximum extent possible. Where in-channel work is necessary, precautions shall
be taken to stabilize the work area during construction to minimize erosion.
The channel (including bed and banks) shall be restored, and all disturbed area
stabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed.
      (2)   Where a watercourse will be crossed regularly during construction,
a non-erodible temporary stream crossing shall be provided.
   (m)   Construction Access Routes.
      (1)   Measures shall be taken to prevent soil transport onto surfaces
where runoff is not checked by sediment controls, such as public roads. Stone
construction entrance(s) shall be implemented as soon as possible. The
entrances shall be planned and installed according to the requirements in the
most recent edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual or as
directed by the Municipal Engineer.
      (2)   Where soil is transported onto public road surfaces, the roads
shall be cleaned thoroughly by either sweeping or scraping at the end of each
workday or more frequently, in order to ensure public safety. Street washing
shall be allowed only after shoveling or sweeping has removed most of the
sediment.
      (3)   Erodible material ramps in streets to enable equipment to cross
curbs shall be properly removed immediately after use.
   (n)   Maintenance and Removal of Temporary Measures.
      (1)   All temporary erosion and sediment control practices shall be
maintained and repaired to assure continued performance.
      (2)   All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be
removed within 30 days after final site stabilization is achieved or after the
temporary measures are no longer needed. Trapped sediment and other disturbed
soil areas resulting from the removal of temporary measures shall have the
final grade re-established and be permanently stabilized to prevent further
erosion and sedimentation.
   (o)   Control of Construction Site Debris and Wastes. All site owners and/or
applicants, contractors and developers shall control wastes such as discarded
building materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter, and sanitary
waste or debris from the site to the extent practical. Site management
practices shall be implemented to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials,
or other debris from entering drainage channels. These practices shall include,
but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   If applicable, a dumpster shall be made available for the proper
disposal of construction site waste materials, garbage, plaster, drywall,
grout, gypsum, etc. If applicable, a second covered dumpster will be provided
for the proper disposal of toxic and/or hazardous wastes.
      (2)   The washing of any concrete material into a street, catch basin, or
other public facility or natural resource shall not occur. A designated area
for concrete washouts shall be made available and used for all concrete
washouts.
      (3)   All fuel tanks and drums shall be stored in a marked storage area.
A dike shall be constructed around this storage area with a minimum capacity
equal to 110 percent of the volume of the largest container in the storage
area. All additional requirements of the local fire authority must be followed.
If the fuel tanks have a self- contained dike, the plug will be kept in the
dike tank at all times.
      (4)   Any toxic or hazardous wastes and/or contaminated soils must be
disposed of according to all applicable environmental laws and statutes. Local
health districts and Ohio EPA can provide guidance on these issues.
      (5)   Paint, paint washing liquids, excess paints and other paint wastes
are considered solid wastes and shall be disposed of in accordance with
applicable state regulations. Appropriate handling of these wastes shall occur
at the site so as to prevent the discharge of these wastes into surface or
ground waters.
         A.   Water-based paint washing liquids and small quantities of excess
water-based paints shall be properly disposed of off-site.
         B.   All other paints, paint thinners, and paint cleaning materials
will be properly disposed of off-site or in the site's hazardous waste disposal
dumpster or container.
   (p)   Use, Safety and Maintenance of Storm Water Practices.
      (1)   Storm water management practices shall be designed for the ultimate
use of the site and function safely and with minimal maintenance. Areas
developed for a subdivision shall provide a storm water management system for
the ultimate development of all the subdivided lots and street rights-of-way.
      (2)   If an inspection by a representative of the municipality or OEPA
reveals that a control practice needs repair or maintenance, upon proper
notice, the site owner and/or applicant shall repair same according to the
Timeline Correction Table as identified in Section
1295.08(g).
   (q)   Inspection of Storm Water Controls. See Section
1295.08(h) for specific requirements. All on-site and off-site (if applicable)
control practices shall be periodically inspected by both the site owner and/or

factor (K) and runoff curve number (CN) per individual subdrainage unit for a
24-hour storm of a one-year frequency.
         D.   Include a hydrograph for a 24-hour storm of the critical
frequency to be controlled and all calculations made pertinent to evaluate the
effects of the proposed development on the pre-development runoff conditions of
the site.

Technical Release 55, (TR55) , the total volume of runoff from a one-year
frequency, 24-hour storm occurring on the development area before, during and
after development.
         B.   From the volumes determined in division A. above, determine the
percentage increase in volume of runoff due to the proposed development, and
using this percentage, select the 24-hour critical storm from the following
table:

         B.   Written procedures for operation and maintenance and training new
maintenance personnel.
         C.   Discharges from the SMPs shall not exceed design criteria or
cause or contribute to water quality standard violations in accordance with the
following criteria:
               BMPs shall be designed such that the drain time is long enough
to provide treatment but short enough to provide storage for successive
rainfall events and avoid the creation of nuisance conditions. The outlet
structure for the post-construction BMP shall not discharge more than the first
half of the WQv in less than one-third of the drain time. The WQv is the volume
of storm water runoff that must be detained by a post-construction practice as
specified by the most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development
manual.
               Post-construction practices shall be sized to treat 100 percent
of the WQv associated with their contributing drainage area. If there is an
existing post-construction BMP that treats runoff from the disturbed area and
the BMP meets the post-construction requirements of this permit, no additional
post-construction BMP will be required. Design information for such facilities
such as contributing drainage areas, capacities, elevations, outlet details and
drain times shall be included in the SWP3.

CHAPTER 1297
Solar Power Plants
1297.01   Purpose.
1297.02   Applicability.
1297.03   Maintenance and non-use.
1297.04   General application requirements.
1297.05   Solar power plant development standards.
1297.99   Penalty.
1297.01   PURPOSE.
   This chapter establishes the regulations and requirements for solar power
plants within zoning districts. These regulations are necessary to balance the
need for clean, renewable energy resources and the need to protect the public
health, safety and welfare of the community, and to ensure that alternative
energy systems are appropriately designed and safely sited and installed. In
the event of a conflict between the development standards in this chapter and
the development standards in the applicable zoning district, the standards of
this chapter are to be used.
(Ord. 18-009. Passed 6-19-18.)
1297.02   APPLICABILITY.
   This chapter applies to all solar power plants, as defined in
Chapter 1240, to be constructed or installed within the Village of Grafton
after the effective date of this chapter. Existing alternative energy systems,
constructed or installed before the effective date of this chapter, may
continue in operation provided such system is not expanded, enlarged, or
otherwise modified except in conformance with this chapter.
(Ord. 18-009. Passed 6-19-18.)
1297.03   MAINTENANCE AND NON-USE.
   (a)   All solar power plants and related components and equipment shall be
properly maintained and kept in operation. Any solar power plant that remains
nonfunctional or inoperative for a continuous period of six months shall be
deemed to be abandoned and shall constitute public nuisance. The owner shall be
notified of the violation of Village of Grafton Codified Ordinances
Chapter 1488, Property Maintenance Code.
   (b)   Removal of the solar power plants shall include the removal of all
structures, including foundations, transmission/interconnection equipment.
Failure to remove all such structures, including foundations, transmission/
interconnection shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and shall be
handled in the same manner as other nuisances, Village of Grafton Codified
Ordinances
Chapter 1488, Property Maintenance Code.
(Ord. 18-009. Passed 6-19-18.)
1297.04   GENERAL APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS.
   No solar power plant shall be erected or installed in the Village until
approval has been granted by the Village per all applicable ordinances, a grid
interconnection agreement or power contract has been signed by the Village
Administrator, and all requirements of the Building Department have been
satisfied. Written application to construct a solar power plant shall be made
to the Village, in accordance with requirements contained in
Chapter 1242 and
1250 as applicable. A proposed solar power plant is also subject to the
requirements of site plan review described in
Chapter 1248. The following supplementary information shall also be included in
an application to construct a solar power plant.
   (a)   The application will also include the name, address and telephone
number of the licensed and registered electrical contractor(s) that will make
all installations.
   (b)   A description of the probable useful life of the solar power plant,
along with a decommissioning plan for the system. Removal of a solar power
plant shall require at least a 90-day notification to the Village, the Village
Administrator and the Village Electric Superintendent. Decommissioning shall
include removal of solar panels and enclosed buildings with electrical
equipment. Disturbed earth shall be graded and reseeded. The Village of Grafton
may require some form of guarantee as determined necessary based on Planning
Commission's recommendation and Council's approval to ensure proper facility
decommissioning and prompt removal of solar panels and/or related equipment at
the end of the useful life of the solar power plant. Such guarantee may be
required as part of the zoning approval process and/or as part of any lease
agreement(s) between the Village of Grafton and the owner of the facility.
   (c)   A description of the proposed solar power plant system, including
information regarding its construction method of assembly and installation.
This description shall include drawings showing proposed inverter, metering and
utility grid connections. Elevations of a typical solar panel unit and enclosed
buildings shall be provided.
   (d)   Description of related solar easements to be acquired to protect solar
access for the power plant. This information is in addition to any on-site
easements shown on a site plan submitted pursuant to Section
1248.02.
(Ord. 18-009. Passed 6-19-18; Ord. 19-010. Passed 6-18-19.)
1297.05   SOLAR POWER PLANT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   Solar power plants are a conditional use in specific zoning districts, and
shall meet the requirements of the underlying zoning district,
Chapter 1250, and the additional performance and design standards requirements
of this section. Specific performance and design standards for solar power
plants are as follows:
   (a)   Maximum Height: The maximum height for all structures associated with
a solar power plant is equal to the maximum permitted height of principal
structures in the district it is located in.
   (b)   Setbacks: All structures associated with a commercial solar power
plant shall be set back from all property lines and public road rights-of-way
in compliance with the applicable zoning district. For solar park developments,
Council may determine that solar pedestal & panels do not qualify as structures
for Zoning District setback purposes; however, a setback of at least 30 feet or
one and one-half times the height of the structure, whichever is greater, shall
be maintained from all property lines unless adjacent to residential uses,
where Zoning District specified setbacks shall be maintained. This requirement
is applicable to both residentially zoned lots and to existing residential uses
both inside and outside the Village. Additional setbacks may also be required
to mitigate noise and glare impacts.
   (c)   Security: A security fence may be required around the perimeter of the
solar power plant. This determination shall be made as part of the conditional
use and/or site plan review approval process, and will include a determination
regarding height and material to be used. The decision to require a fence shall
be based on specific site conditions and the nature and character of
surrounding land uses.
   (d)   Noise: No solar power plant shall produce noise from transformers or
other electrical equipment that exceeds 55 dBA as measured at the property line
or 50 dBA as measured at the nearest neighboring habitable building. An
independent noise study may be required to document compliance with this
requirement as part of the approval process.
   (e)   Appearance: Buildings and accessory structures shall, to the extent
reasonably possible, use materials, colors, and textures that will blend with
the existing environment. Appropriate landscaping and/or screening materials
may be required to help screen the solar power plant from neighboring
residences.
   (f)   Electrical Connections: All electrical interconnections within the
project boundary shall be underground.
   (g)   No solar power plant shall be connected to the Village municipal power
system without properly executed grid interconnection agreement or power
contract. Under no circumstances shall solar power plants provide power to off-
site building(s), structures, uses or other power energy distribution systems
(power grids) other than the Village municipal power system. All installations
will be performed by a licensed electrical contractor.
   (h)   All electrical control panels, as well as control equipment, shall be
labeled and secured to prevent unauthorized access. All installations will
include an external disconnect to allow for the isolation of the alternative
energy system from the Village municipal power system.
   (i)   All solar power plants shall be designed to conform to all the
requirements of the Ohio Building Code, Ohio Residential Code the National
Electrical Code and all other applicable regulations. All solar power plants to
be connected to the Village's municipal power system shall be metered, and
shall have grid failure disconnect systems and shall adhere to R.C. § 4928.67
and UL 1741, Standard for Utility-Interactive Applications.
   (j)   Solar panels shall be designed to absorb (not reflect) sunlight. Solar
panel placement should be arranged to minimize or negate any solar glare onto
nearby properties or roadways, without duly impacting the functionality or
efficiency of the solar system.
   (k)   A private access road must be provided from a state or Village roadway
to enclosed buildings to provide for maintenance and emergency vehicle access.
   (l)   A clearly visible warning sign shall be placed at the base of all pad-
mounted transformers and substations and on any fence surrounding the solar
power plant informing individuals of potential voltage hazards.
   (m)   The solar power plant shall not be artificially illuminated except to
the extent required for safety or applicable federal, state or local
regulations, and to the minimum extent necessary for security purposes.
(Ord. 18-009. Passed 6-19-18; Ord. 19-010. Passed 6-18-19.)
1297.99   PENALTY.
   (a)   Penalties for Violation. Violation of the provisions of this chapter
or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in various sections of this chapter,
shall constitute a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. Any person who violates
this chapter, or fails to comply with any of its requirements, shall upon
conviction thereof be fined not more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both, and in addition shall pay all
costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues
after receipt of a violation notice shall be considered a separate offense. The
owner or tenant of any building, structure, premises, or part thereof, and any
architect, builder, contractor, agent or other person who commits, participates
in, assists in, or maintains such violation may be found guilty of a separate
offense and suffer the penalties herein provided. Nothing herein contained
shall prevent the Village from taking such other lawful action as is necessary
to prevent or remedy any violations.
   (b)   Civil Action. In case any building is or is proposed to be located,
erected, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, changed, maintained or used, or
any land is or is proposed to be used in violation of law or of this chapter,
or any amendment thereto, the Village Council, the Village Law Director, the
Zoning Administrator or any adjacent or neighboring property owner who would be
especially damaged by such violation may, in addition to other appropriate
action, enter proceedings to prevent, enjoin, abate or remove such unlawful
location, erection, construction, reconstruction, enlargement, change,
maintenance or use.
   (c)   Remedies Cumulative. The exercise of the rights and remedies granted
in this section shall in no way preclude or limit the Village or any person
from exercising any other right or remedy now or hereafter granted to them
under the state law.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
1460.01   STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens.
(Ord. 08-010. Passed 6-3-08.)
1460.02   FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Village has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 08-010. Passed 6-3-08.)
1460.03   STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 08-010. Passed 6-3-08.)
1460.04   METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 08-010. Passed 6-3-08.)
1460.05   LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the Village as identified in Section
1460.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
Village.
(Ord. 08-010. Passed 6-3-08.)
1460.06   BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (a)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
      (1)   "Flood Insurance Study Lorain County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas"
and "Flood Insurance Rate Map Lorain County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas" both
effective August 19, 2008.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village as required by Section
1460.27.
   (b)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at 960 Main Street, Grafton, Ohio 44044.
(Ord. 08-010. Passed 6-3-08.)
1460.07   ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 08-010. Passed 6-3-08.)
1460.08   INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 08-010. Passed 6-3-08.)
1460.09   WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the Village, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 08-010. Passed 6-3-08.)
1460.10   SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 08-010. Passed 6-3-08.)

   (p)   "Flood protection elevation (FPE)" is the base flood elevation plus
two feet of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   "Floodway."
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   "Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   "Historic structure" means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office; or
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the Village's historic preservation program, which program is certified by
the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   "Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis" means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   "Letter of map change (LOMC)" is an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary
and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   "Letter of map amendment (LOMA)" means a revision based on
technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated
special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance
rate map and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special
flood hazard area.
      (2)   "Letter of map revision (LOMR)" means a revision based on technical
data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   "Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR)" means a formal review
and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, or flood insurance studies.
   (v)   "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a recreational vehicle. For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   "Manufactured home park," as specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured
homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue
purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure
used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land
that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are
for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the
lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured
homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (y)   "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)" is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   "New construction" means structures for which the start of
construction commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village
Flood Insurance Rate Map, July 2, 1980, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   "Person" includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including State and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, State college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or State community college. "Agency" does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (bb)   "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is built on a single
chassis, 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   "Registered professional architect" means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C.
4703.01 to 4703.19.
   (dd)   "Registered professional engineer" means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   "Registered professional surveyor" means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   "Special flood hazard area," also known as "areas of special flood
hazard", is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood
insurance studies, flood boundary and floodway maps and flood hazard boundary
maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other Federal,
State or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   "Start of construction" means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered new construction;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (kk)   "Variance" means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.

1460.21   MAP MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.
   To meet National Flood Insurance Program minimum requirements to have flood
data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to ensure that the Village's flood
maps, studies and other data identified in Section
1460.06 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
   (a)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
      (1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         A.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         B.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
         C.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
         D.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section

Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map
revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to paragraph (a)(1)
hereof.
   (b)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator may
request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does
not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such
as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the Village Administrator, and may
be submitted at any time.
   (c)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain Administrator
shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the Village have been
modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an area, or
no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations
for a particular area. In order that the Village's flood insurance rate map
accurately represent the Village boundaries, include within such notification a
copy of a map of the Village suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the Village has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
(Ord. 08-010. Passed 6-3-08.)
1460.22   DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
Federal, State, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When preliminary flood insurance rate maps and/or flood insurance
study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by the
FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no
base flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Section
1460.34 through
1460.39.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
(Ord. 08-010. Passed 6-3-08.)
1460.23   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
Federal, State, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

1460.33   ASSURANCE OF FLOOD CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (a)   Development in Floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         A.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1460.21(a);
         B.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         C.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         D.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         E.   Concurrence of the Village Administrator and the chief executive
officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (b)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Paragraph (a)(2), items A. and C. through E. hereof.
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the "USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique"
or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1460.21(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
(Ord. 08-010. Passed 6-3-08.)
APPEALS AND VARIANCES
1460.34   APPEALS BOARD ESTABLISHED.

   (a)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official action
of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a hearing on
the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall file,
within fourteen days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   (b)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
(Ord. 08-010. Passed 6-3-08.)
1460.37   VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the Village.
   (b)   Public Hearing.
      (1)   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (3)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (c)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in paragraphs (b)(1)A. to K. hereof
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. 08-010. Passed 6-3-08.)
1460.38   PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (a)   All testimony shall be given under oath.

attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
   (h)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its decision.
The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and thereafter
issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a reasonable
time after the hearing.

(Ord. 834. Passed 12-4-73.)
1462.07   FENCES.
   (a)   Definition. As used in this section, "fence" means a structure or a
continuous barrier erected around or by the side of any open space to prevent
passage or for protection. Fences may be solid or open and may be constructed
of masonry, metal, wood or any other material securely fastened to the ground.
A natural plant species which has been planted to form a continuous barrier to
prevent passage or for protection shall be considered a fence for the purpose
of this section.
   (b)   Nonresidential Fences. Whenever the installation of nonresidential
fences is required by these Codified Ordinances, or when such fences are
voluntarily installed, the following regulations shall be observed:
      (1)   No fence shall be erected or maintained entirely of barbed wire, be
in any way electrified or be topped with broken glass, spikes or other sharp-
edged materials.
      (2)   A maximum of three strands of barbed wire may be placed on a fence
which the top of is at least six feet above average grade, provided that the
barbed wire is placed on a 45 degree angle-arm, away from the side of the fence
that fronts a property line, public sidewalk or public right of way.
      (3)   Fences enclosing junk yards shall be constructed in accordance with
the provisions of Section
816.05 of these Codified Ordinances.
      (4)   All fences shall be erected to withstand a 15-pound horizontal wind
pressure, placed perpendicular to the ground and substantially and properly
supported according to standard practice.
      (5)   Fence gates, doors and other obstructions shall not swing across
sidewalks or public rights of way.
(Ord. 90-171. Passed 6-19-90.)
      (6)   The "finished" or "decorative" side of all fences shall face the
public way and neighboring properties.
(Ord. 95-017. Passed 5-16-95.)
   (c)   Residential Fences.
      (1)   No fence exceeding 3½ feet in height shall be erected, altered,
relocated or reconstructed upon, along or adjacent to any boundary line between
the front property line and the building line established on the street. Fences
extending beyond the building line established on the street and along the
front lot line shall be open for at least 50% of the projected area, and the
open space so formed shall be evenly distributed, except that fences formed of
a natural plant species may be compact throughout. For the purpose of enforcing
this section, corner lots are assumed to have two front lot lines.
      (2)   Fences facing a rear lot line, except when adjoining a side lot
line which is in front of a front building line, and side yard fences extending
from the rear lot line to the required front building line, shall not be higher
than six feet.
      (3)   Residential fencing shall not be topped with sharp points such as
may readily result in bodily injury, and no residential fencing shall be of
barbed wire. If a natural plant species is used as a fence and the plant
species used is briars, prickers, thorns or any other foliage which can
scratch, injure or harm a person or animal, the owner of such natural plant
species used as a fence shall keep it trimmed.
      (4)   A fence built around a patio may be solid or open and six and one-
half feet high, whether such enclosure is located in the side or rear yard.
However, such fence shall be at least the same distance from the property line
as is required by zoning for the main building.
      (5)   The height of a fence shall be measured from a point not to exceed
six inches above the finished grade line or natural contour of the ground. A
fence shall follow the contour of the ground as far as is practical.
      (6)   Where solid fences are erected and where a water drainage situation
occurs, such a problem shall be disposed of by placing adequate outlets at the
bottom of the fence to eliminate possible accumulation of stagnant water or
other undesirable conditions.
      (7)   Fence gates, doors and other obstructions shall not swing across
sidewalks or a public way.
(Ord. 90-171. Passed 6-19-90.)
      (8)   The "finished" or "decorative" side of all fences shall face the
public way and neighboring properties.
(Ord. 95-017. Passed 5-16-95.)
   (d)   Advertising. No advertising or posting of bills shall be allowed on
any fence, except as permitted in Section
816.05 of these Codified Ordinances.
   (e)   Maintenance.
      (1)   All fences shall be kept in good repair and be capable of
performing the function for which they were installed.
      (2)   All fences shall be periodically treated with chemicals, paint or
other covering so as to retard and prevent corrosion, rotting or deterioration.
(Ord. 90-171. Passed 6-19-90.)

      (1)   No person shall suffer, permit or allow to exist within the Village
any act, thing or condition of a kind which has been or may hereafter be
defined by ordinance as a public nuisance.
      (2)   Whenever a public nuisance exists, the Chief Building Official
shall cause the owner, tenant or person in charge of such property upon which
such public nuisance exists to be served with a notice to abate the public
nuisance. Compliance shall be required within not less than three days after
receipt of such notice. Such notice shall be personally served upon the owner,
tenant or person in charge of the premises. If such notice is not able to be
served personally on the owner, tenant or person in charge, such notice shall
be posted in a conspicuous place in or about the premises affected by the
notice and such notice shall be mailed to the person who did not receive
personal service by certified U.S. mail, return receipt requested, and regular
U.S. mail, evidenced by certificate of mailing, to his or her last known
address. Such service shall be deemed received three days after posting or
three days after mailing, whichever is later. Service of such notice in the
foregoing manner upon the owner's agent or upon the person in charge of the
premises shall constitute service of notice upon the owner.
      (3)   A.   Whoever fails to comply with such notice shall be deemed
guilty of a minor misdemeanor and each day of such noncompliance shall
constitute a separate offense. A second offense for violation of this section
within six months is a misdemeanor of the fourth degree and each day of such
noncompliance shall constitute a separate offense.
         B.   The penalty for a minor misdemeanor is a fine up to one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00) plus court costs. The penalty for a third-degree
misdemeanor is a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus
court costs.
   (b)   Public Nuisance Defined. The following shall be deemed to constitute a
public nuisance within the Village:
      (1)   The erection, continuance, use or maintenance of a building,
structure, place or property for the operation or exercise of a trade,
employment or business, or the keeping or feeding of any animal either upon
public or private real property, which, by causing noxious exhalations, noise
disturbances, or offensive smells becomes injurious to the health, comfort or
property of any person or the public, or which causes damage to any person or
property of any person or the public;
      (2)   The storage of garbage and/or offal, which means and includes all
refuse and waste of animals, fish, fowl, fruit and vegetable matter or other
accumulations in the use and preparation of food for the table, or which has
been discarded and abandoned and is of no further use or value to the owner for
domestic consumption;
      (3)   The suffering, permitting, allowing to remain or maintaining of
rubbish, refuse or junk which includes, but is not limited to, wire, chips,
shavings, bottles, broken glass, crockery, metal, cast or wooden ware, boxes,
rags, weeds, paper, circulars, handbills, boots, shoes or ashes, or discarded
or abandoned furniture, freezers, iceboxes, refrigerators, washing machines or
other airtight or semi-airtight containers, or any other waste material upon
public or private property contrary to the Codified Ordinances or regulations
of the Lorain County Board of Health;
      (4)   The maintenance or allowance of building materials upon public or
private property constitutes a public nuisance if such building materials,
which include all residue from building construction and new building
materials, are not removed or utilized in construction within thirty days after
such materials are placed upon a premises. However, if construction is
initiated upon such premises and such building materials are to be used in the
construction, then such building materials shall be allowed to remain upon such
premises for a period of time not to exceed thirty days after the completion of
the construction. For the purpose of the prevention of rodents and other
unsanitary conditions, any storage of building materials or deposit of the same
upon any property shall consist of building materials being placed at least six
inches off the ground at any time;
      (5)   The storage, suffering, permitting, allowing to remain or
maintaining of scrap tires on the open ground or in any type of container or
vehicle or trailer on any public or private property; or the storage of scrap
tires on or in public or private property in violation of any Federal, State or
local law, rule or regulation; or in violation of any order or regulation of
the Lorain County Board of Health. The registered owner, lessee or other person
having control of any property, vehicle or trailer containing scrap tires shall
be presumed to have allowed the existence of said nuisance.
   (c)   Enforcement. Whenever any public nuisance exists, at the request of
Council, the Law Director may institute proceedings, either legal or equitable,
that may be appropriate or necessary for the enforcement or abatement of the
public nuisance. This section shall not relieve any person from criminal
prosecution or punishment under the Codified Ordinances or any other criminal
law enforced in the Village.
   (d)   Remedy of Village. If the owner or person having charge of any
premises within the Village upon which exists a public nuisance fails to comply
with any notice established herein or fails to prohibit the existence of such
public nuisance, the Village has the authority to take whatever action is
necessary to abate the public nuisance, including, but not limited to, entering
upon any public or private property, and expending or furnishing labor and
materials necessary to abate the public nuisance. All such expenses and costs
shall be paid out of Village funds appropriated therefor, and the Village shall
thereafter report such expenses to the County Auditor. Such amounts shall
thereupon be entered upon the tax duplicate and be a lien upon such lands from
and after the date of the entry thereon, and shall be collected as other taxes
and returned to the Village when so collected.
