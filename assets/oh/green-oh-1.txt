said office. The Council member newly elected pursuant to this provision shall

serve for the unexpired term of the Council member in whose office the vacancy
occurred.
   In the event a vacancy shall occur in the office of a Council member between
a November General Election and December 31 of that year, the above time
periods to fill the vacancy shall be tolled and, therefore, not begin to run,
until January 1 of the following year. (Amended November 5, 2019)

   B.   Resolutions and Ordinances. All legislative action of Council shall be
by resolution or ordinance introduced in written form whether electronic or

not apply to appropriation measures that contain the various subjects and
accounts for which moneys are to be appropriated and codification or re-
codification of ordinances and resolutions.

or ordinance superseding it contains the entire resolution or ordinance as

original resolution or ordinance, or section or sections thereof, shall be
considered to be repealed.

required for the enactment of every resolution or ordinance, unless a larger

title thereof is fully read, provided that such ordinance or resolution shall
be read in full if so directed by motion approved by affirmative vote of a
simple majority of Council.
   Each resolution or ordinance providing for:
      1.   The appropriation of money; or
      2.   Improvements petitioned for by a majority of the owners of the
adjacent property to be benefited and specially assessed therefor; or
      3.   Any emergency resolution or ordinance necessary for the immediate
preservation of public peace, health, welfare, or safety; shall take effect,
unless a later date be specified therein, upon its passage and approval by the
Mayor, or upon the expiration of the time within which it may be vetoed by the
Mayor, or upon its passage over veto by the Mayor, as the case may be.
   No other resolution or ordinance shall become effective until thirty (30)
days after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or upon the expiration of the
time within which it may be vetoed by the Mayor, or upon its passage over veto
by the Mayor, as the case may be.
   No action of Council authorizing:
      1.   The surrender or joint exercise of any of its powers; or
      2.   The granting of any franchise; or
      3.   The enactment, amendment, or repeal of any zoning or building
resolution or ordinance; or
      4.   An increase of utility rates; or
      5.   The changing of any ward boundaries; or

standing committees of Council as appropriate to the subject matter, unless
this requirement is waived by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the members of
Council.
   The committee(s) shall consider the proposed legislative action separately
and/or jointly and shall report their recommendations to Council for final
disposition.
   The recommendations reported by such committee(s) shall be in writing and
shall be accompanied by the original documents, if any, upon which such report
is based. Such report and supporting documentation shall be entered or referred
to upon the journal of Council.
   If any matter referred to committee has not been reported upon for two (2)
successive regular Council meetings, such matter may be brought before Council,
with or without an accompanying committee report, upon the vote of a two-thirds
(2/3) vote of the members of Council.
   Nothing in this provision shall preclude any standing committee from
proposing an ordinance or resolution on their own initiative. Intentional
failure to follow this section pertaining to committees which results in gross
abuse of corporate power shall invalidate any action taken by the Council as a
whole.
§ 4.10 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES.
   A.   Each emergency resolution and ordinance shall contain a statement of
the necessity for such emergency action, and its enactment shall require the
affirmative vote of three-fourths (3/4) of the members of Council.

      1.   The surrender or joint exercise of any of its powers; or
      2.   The granting of any franchise; or

§ 8.5 ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW CITY SERVICES.
   When a function of the City is proposed to be performed for the first time
subsequent to the adoption of this Charter by officers and employees of the
City rather than pursuant to contracts with other governments, persons, or
firms, and the cost of the annual operation and capital requirements would
exceed twenty percent (20%) of the City’s revenues in the prior fiscal year,
which revenues were lawfully available for such function, then Council shall
place the question of whether such function shall be performed by officers and
employees of the City rather than by contract upon the ballot at the next
general, primary, or regular Municipal election to be held within the City. The
Council may cause such an election to be held at a special election on any date
upon a vote of three-fourths (3/4) of the members of Council.
   This Section shall apply to the police and public utility functions. This
Section shall not apply where a three-fourths (3/4) majority of the members of
Council determines that the function must be established due to State or
national law, or where Council determines by a unanimous vote of its members
that such function cannot be provided by contract at a reasonable cost.
   This provision shall not include programs in effect as of the effective date
of this Charter, or those programs established by this Charter.
   This provision shall not preclude Council from contracting with other
governmental or private entities to provide such services on a fee basis.
ARTICLE IX. CHARTER AMENDMENT AND REVIEW
§ 9.1 CHARTER AMENDMENT.
   This Charter may be amended in accordance with the terms and provisions of
the Constitution of the State of Ohio.
   If two (2) or more inconsistent proposed amendments on the same subject
shall be submitted at the same election, only the one (1) of such amendments
receiving the largest affirmative vote, not less than a majority, shall become
a part of this Charter.
§ 9.2 CHARTER REVIEW.
   In January five (5) years after the effective date of this Charter, and in
January every seven (7) years thereafter, the Mayor shall appoint with approval
of a simple majority vote of the members of Council, by January 14, a Charter
Review Commission composed of five (5) electors of the City. The appointees
shall hold no other City elective or appointive office, nor be employed by the
City except on an advisory board.
   All meetings of the Charter Review Commission shall be public. Such
Commission shall select its own Chairperson and Secretary and adopt its own
rules for the conduct of its business. The members of the Commission, unless
otherwise provided by Council, shall serve without compensation, and the term
of the Commission shall end on the day of the next regular Municipal or Ohio
general election occurring at least nine (9) months after their appointments.
   The Charter Review Commission shall, on or before June 12 of the same year,
recommend to Council any alterations, revisions, or amendments to this Charter.

ARTICLE X. INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM, AND RECALL
§ 10.1 INITIATIVE.
   The electors of the City shall have the same right and power to initiate or
propose any ordinance or resolution as is now or may hereafter be provided by
the Constitution and laws of the State of Ohio, except as otherwise provided in
this Charter.
§ 10.2 REFERENDUM.
   The electors of the City shall have the right and power to approve or reject
any ordinance or resolution or other measure passed by Council as is now or may
later be provided by the Constitution and laws of the State of Ohio, except as
provided in this Charter.
   When petitions for referendum are filed, all preliminary actions required
for the issuing of debt may be taken during the period prior to the referendum
election, but no debt instruments shall be sold, issued or delivered until
after the election has been held and the vote is favorable to issuing the debt
instruments.
§ 10.3 RECALL.
   The electors of the City shall have the power to remove any elective officer
of the City by recall election. If an elective officer has served at least six
(6) months of his term, a petition demanding his removal may be filed with the
Clerk of Council. The manner of signing, the method of circulating, the form
and requirements as to the affidavit, and the other requirements of the general
laws of the State of Ohio regulating initiative and referendum laws shall also
apply in the case of recall in the City, except as otherwise provided in this
Charter. Such petition shall contain the name and office of the person whose
removal is sought and a statement, in not more than two-hundred (200) words, of
the grounds for removal. The circulation of such recall petitions is restricted
to qualified electors for the office of the officer sought to be recalled. Such
petition shall be signed by at least twenty percent (20%) of the registered
electors eligible to vote at the last preceding regular Municipal election for
the office of the officer sought to be recalled.
   Within ten (10) days after such petition shall have been filed, the Clerk of
Council shall determine whether or not the petition meets the requirements
hereof. If the Clerk of Council shall find the petition sufficient, he shall
promptly certify same to Council and shall deliver a copy of such certificate
to the officer whose removal is sought and shall make a record of such
delivery. If the officer whose removal is sought does not resign within seven
(7) days after such delivery is made, the Council shall thereupon fix a day for
holding a recall election, not less than forty-five (45) and not more than
sixty (60) days after the date of such refusal to resign.
   At such recall election, this question shall be placed on the ballot: “Shall
(name of officer) be allowed to continue as (name of office)?”, with provision
on the ballot for voting affirmatively or negatively on the question. If a
majority of the votes cast are certified in the affirmative, such officer shall
remain in office and no further recall petition may be filed against him for a
period of two (2) years. If a majority of the votes cast are certified in the
negative, such officer shall be considered as removed, his office shall be
declared vacant, and such vacancy shall be filled as provided in this Charter.
The officer removed by such recall election shall not be eligible for
appointment to the vacancy created thereby, nor shall he be eligible for
appointed office in the City for a period of one (1) year from the date of his
removal.

ARTICLE XII. GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 12.1 SUCCESSION.
   The City of Green, under this Charter, is hereby declared to be the legal
successor of the City of Green, under the general laws of the State of Ohio,
and as such it has title to all property, real and personal, owned by its
predecessor including all moneys on deposit and all taxes in process of
collection together with all accounts receivable and rights of action. The City
is liable for all outstanding orders, contracts, and debts of its predecessor,
and for any other obligations for which it may be held liable, as such
successor, by any court of competent jurisdiction. All contracts entered into
by the City for its benefit prior to the effective date of this Charter, shall
continue in full force and effect.
   All laws and parts of laws relating to or affecting the City in force when
this Charter shall take effect are hereby repealed and superseded to the extent
that the same are inconsistent with the provisions of the Charter; however, all
laws, ordinances and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of the
Charter shall continue in full force and effect until the same shall be
lawfully amended or repealed under the terms and provisions of this Charter.
§ 12.2 DEFINITION OF MAJORITY.
   For as long as Council shall consist of seven (7) members, a simple majority
shall be deemed to be four (4) members, a two-thirds (2/3) majority shall be

charter amendment, the number of votes satisfying these definitions shall be
revised appropriately to be consistent with the stated types of majority,
providing that the number of votes satisfying each definition shall be

§ 12.3 HEADINGS.
   The article and section headings herein have been inserted for convenience
in reference and are not intended to define or limit the scope of, or otherwise
affect, any provisions of this Charter.
§ 12.4 GENDER.

neutral terms.
(Amended August 27, 2019 per Resolution 2019-R52)
§ 12.5 DEADLINES.
   The time within or by which any act or thing is required to be done by any
of the provisions of this Charter shall be computed by excluding the first day
and including the last day, except that when the last day falls on a Saturday,
Sunday, or legal holiday, then the act or thing shall be done by the next
succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
§ 12.6 OPEN MEETINGS.
   It is the intent of this Charter that, except as provided herein, meetings
of public bodies shall be held in accord with Ohio’s Open Meetings Act, Section
121.22 of the Ohio Revised Code, including, but not limited to, any successor
or related section or amendment thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
following provisions shall take precedence over and amplify the Ohio Open
Meetings Act, (Section 121.22 of the Revised Code), including but not limited
to any successor or related section or amendment thereto.
   A.   A board, commission, or committee shall not be deemed to be a public
body if its sole authority is to make recommendations to a decision-making
body. However, all committees or similar bodies of Council shall be deemed to
be public bodies, even if such committees contain less than a majority of
Council members and have no decision-making authority. For purposes of this
provision, a “committee of Council” shall include any committee appointed by
Council which includes two (2) or more Council members, whether serving in a
voting or non-voting capacity.
   B.   Executive sessions may be held by public bodies with an attorney for
the purpose of discussing pending or imminent court action involving the City,
or for the purpose of seeking and receiving legal counsel and advice on any
matter involving the City.
§ 12.7 ETHICAL CONDUCT AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
   The standards of ethical conduct and avoidance of conflicts of interest for
all elected and appointed officers, officials, and employees of the City shall
be those established by the general laws of the State of Ohio.
   The civil and criminal penalties imposable for violations of such standards
shall be in accordance with the general laws of the State of Ohio.
§ 12.8 REMOVAL OF OFFICIALS.
   Elected officials and members of City Boards and Commissions shall be
removed for cause as provided in this Section of the Charter.
   As used in this section of the Charter, the “charging official” shall mean:
The Mayor, except where the person accused of grounds for removal is the person
holding the office of Mayor; or the President of Council where the person
sought to be removed for cause holds the office of Mayor.
   The charging official, if he has reason to believe there is probable cause
(as such causes are defined in this section) for removal of an elected official
or member of a City board or commission, shall give notice of the alleged cause
for removal and the time, date, and place of the commencement of a hearing for
removal, which shall not be earlier than ten (10) days after the service of the
notice, to the accused person by personal service, certified mail or by leaving
a copy of such notice at the person’s last known place of residence in the
City. At such time, date, and place and at any adjourned meetings of such
hearing, the Council shall hear the cause for removal; shall provide an
opportunity for the accused person to be heard and present defenses and shall
determine whether the accused person shall be removed from office. The Council
may remove an official for any of the following causes by a three-fourths (3/4)
vote of the members of Council. Such person shall not vote on any matter during
the removal procedure and shall not be counted in determining required
majorities. The following are grounds for removal of elected officials and
members of City Boards and Commissions:
   A.   Failure to possess the qualifications of office required pursuant to
the provisions of this Charter.
   B.   Conviction of a felony or other crime involving moral turpitude.
   C.   Failure to take the required oath, or to give any bond required of him
within twenty (20) days after effective date of his election or appointment, or
obligation to give a new or additional bond.
   D.   Being adjudicated legally incompetent.
   E.   Conduct which is determined by Council to be gross misconduct or gross
neglect of duty with respect to his official powers or duties.
   F.   Violation of his oath of office.
   G.   Gross failure of a Council member or of a City board or commission
member to abide by the rules of Council or the City board or commission, as
appropriate; or absence from three (3) consecutive regular meetings of the
Council or City board or commission without being excused by Council or the
City board or commission, as appropriate.
   Upon the removal of an official from office pursuant to this Section, the
office of the offending person shall be declared vacant, subject to any appeal
to and review by an appropriate court, and the vacancy shall be filled as
provided in this Charter.
   The removal of an official or the occurrence of any of the causes permitting
the removal shall not invalidate any action of the official or anybody,
including Council, in which the member participated. The subsequent removal of
a person who fills a vacancy created pursuant to this section by reinstatement
by a court of a person previously removed by Council, shall not invalidate any
action of the person who filled the vacancy or anybody, including Council, in
which such person who filled the vacancy participated.
   Council shall be the judge of the qualifications of and of the grounds for
removal from office and shall conduct the proceedings relative to removal.
Council shall have the power to subpoena witnesses, administer oaths, and
require the production of evidence, either on its own motion or through the
process of any appropriate court or officer thereof. A person charged with
conduct constituting grounds for removal from office shall receive a public
hearing, and a record of the proceedings shall be made and preserved. A notice
of such hearing shall be published in at least any one (1) newspaper of general
circulation in the City at least one (1) week in advance of the hearing, and in
such event, the President of Council, or other presiding officer of Council,
may reschedule the time, date, and place of the hearing to accommodate the
publication of the notice. If the hearing is rescheduled, the President of
Council, or other presiding officer, shall notify the accused person of such
fact. Decisions made by Council under this Section shall be subject to review
by the Courts on matters of law and whether Council acted arbitrarily and
without probative evidence to support the grounds for removal.
   The Director of Law or special counsel engaged by the Director of Law shall
prosecute the removal proceedings before Council and any review thereof by the
courts. In the event the person sought to be removed from office is the
Director of Law, a special counsel engaged by the Mayor, with the approval of a
majority of Council, (Amended November 5, 2019) shall prosecute the removal
proceedings before Council and any review thereof by the courts. If a person
accused is not finally removed, the City shall pay the reasonable costs of the
defense of such person and any compensation withheld pending the appeal of the
action of Council.
§ 12.9 SEPARABILITY.
   If a section or part of a section of this Charter proves to be invalid or
unconstitutional, the same shall not be held to invalidate or impair the
validity, force, or effect of any other section, or part of a section of this
Charter, unless it clearly appears that such other section, or part of a
section, is wholly and necessarily dependent for its operation upon the section
or part of a section so held invalid or unconstitutional.
§ 12.10 CHARTER CORRECTIONS.
   City Council shall be authorized to make typographical corrections to or
changes or deletions in, as well as changes in the form of, the Charter;
however, the changes shall relate to matters of form; or, to make the Charter
consistent with Ohio law, upon advice of the Director of Law. Any such
modification, change, or correction shall, in all cases, be approved by
resolution of Council, prior to going into effect. No modification, change or
correction shall affect the construction, meaning, substance, or intent of the
Charter as adopted and amended by the people, except where the change corrects
the Charter to comply with Ohio law. The specific powers granted by this
Section include:
   A.   City Council may correct obvious misspellings and typographical errors.
   B.   City Council may divide the text of any section or paragraph into
shorter paragraphs or subparagraphs and letter or number the same to improve
clarity and ease of reference.
   C.   City Council may renumber the sections and rearrange their order to
provide:
      1.   More coherent grouping of sections related in subject matter; and
      2.   Continuous, consecutive numbering of sections.
   D.   City Council may remove inconsistent language and correct language that
violates Ohio law to ensure that the Charter complies with Ohio law.
   Upon the adoption of any amendment that creates or abolishes an office or
offices or changes the powers or duties of any officer or agency of the City,
the City Council shall make necessary correlative changes in existing sections
that refer to such offices, officers, or agencies by deleting therefrom, as the
case may be, the name of the office created or the title of the officer or
agency then having such powers or duties.
(Amended November 6, 2012)
ARTICLE XIII. GAMING
   Casino gaming, horseracing, scheme of chance, game of chance or gambling
device shall not be allowed or operated in the City of Green, except for non-
profit charitable purposes as authorized under Ohio law or Green City
Ordinance. Nothing in this provision shall be construed to nullify the
provisions of the Ohio Constitution Article 15, Section 6.

(R.C. § 1.42)

(R.C. § 1.43)
   (C)   Calendar; computation of time.
      (1)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first and including the last day; except that when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
      (2)   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last
day for doing the act or before its usual closing time on that day, the act may
be performed on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal
holiday.
      (3)   As used in divisions (C)(1) and (C)(2) of this section, LEGAL
HOLIDAY means the following days:
         (a)   The first day of January, known as New Year’s Day;
         (b)   The third Monday in January, known as Martin Luther King, Jr.

      (5)   When an act is to take effect or become operative from and after a

depends upon the order of events on the same day, the priority shall be
determined by the times in the day at which they respectively occurred.
(R.C. § 1.15)
      (6)   If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from
a particular day, the period ends on the same numerical day in the concluding

matter or context of the law is repugnant thereto.
(Prior Code, § 202.03)
§ 10.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (A)   The repeal of a repealing statute does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(R.C. § 1.57)
   (B)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in division (C) of this section:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal; or
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and the
investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced,
and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the ordinance had not
been repealed or amended.
   (C)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(R.C. § 1.58)
   (D)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(R.C. § 1.54)
(Prior Code, § 202.04)
§ 10.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (A)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
section or an inclusive group of sections, or of divisions or subdivisions of a
section, the reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any provision
of the section, sections, divisions or subdivisions included in the reference.
   (B)   References in the code to action taken or authorized under designated
sections of the code include, in every case, action taken or authorized under
the applicable legislative provision which is superseded by this code.

the last numbers or letters are included.
(R.C. § 1.56)

amended, revised, recodified or renumbered, unless the subject matter has been
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
(Prior Code, § 202.05)
§ 10.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (A)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(R.C. § 1.51)
   (B)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of the Legislative
Authority are irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment
prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of the Legislative Authority, one amendment without reference to
another, the amendments are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may
be given to each. If the amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the
latest in date of enactment prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates
language deleted by an earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted
by an earlier amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.
Amendments are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably
be put into simultaneous operation.
(R.C. § 1.52)
   (C)   In the event of a conflict between any of the provisions of this code,
or between any of the provisions of this code and any standard code adopted by
the municipality pursuant to R.C. § 731.231, the provision that establishes the
higher or stricter standard shall control.
(Prior Code, § 202.06)
§ 10.07 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provisions of a section of this code or the application thereof to
any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
other provisions or applications of the section or related sections which can
be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end
the provisions are severable.
(R.C. § 1.50) (Prior Code, § 202.07)
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OFFICES.
   Reference to a public office or officer shall be deemed to apply to any
office, officer or employee of the municipality exercising the powers, duties
or functions contemplated in the provision, irrespective of any transfer of
functions or change in the official title of the functionary.
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered consisting of the misspelling of any
words, the omission of any words necessary to express the intention of the
provisions affected, the use of words to which no meaning can be attached, or
the use of a word when another word was clearly intended to express the
intention, the spelling shall be corrected, and the words supplied, omitted or
substituted shall conform with the manifest intention, and the provision shall
have the same effect as though the correct words were contained in the text as
originally published. No alteration shall be made or permitted if any question
exists regarding the nature or extent of the error.
§ 10.10 ORDINANCES REPEALED.
   With the exception of any ordinances specifically saved by the municipality,
this code, from and after its effective date, shall contain all of the
provisions of a general nature pertaining to the subjects herein enumerated and
embraced. All prior ordinances pertaining to the subjects treated by this code
shall be deemed repealed from and after the effective date of this code of
ordinances.
§ 10.11 ORDINANCES UNAFFECTED.
   All ordinances of a temporary or special nature, all other ordinances
pertaining to subjects not enumerated and embraced in this code of ordinances,
and all ordinances specifically saved by the municipality shall remain in full
force and effect unless herein repealed expressly or by necessary implication.
§ 10.12 ORDINANCES SAVED.
   Whenever an ordinance by its nature either authorizes or enables the
legislative body, or a certain municipal officer or employee, to make
additional ordinances or regulations for the purpose of carrying out the
intention of the ordinance, all ordinances and regulations of a similar nature
serving the purpose, effected prior to the codification and not inconsistent
thereto, shall remain in effect and are saved.
§ 10.13 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.14 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.15 AMENDMENTS TO CODE; AMENDATORY LANGUAGE.
   (A)   Any chapter, section or division amended or added to this code by
ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this code may be numbered in
accordance with the numbering system of this code and need not be inserted in
this code, but shall be treated as if printed for inclusion herein.
   (B)   The following language may be used by the municipality to amend, add,
or repeal a chapter, section, or division:
      (1)   To amend a section: “Section                 of the Municipal Code
of Ordinances is amended to read as follows: ....”

Ordinances, which is to be added to and amends the Municipal Code of

(Prior Code, § 222.01) (Res. 95-R162, passed 12-20-1995; Ord. 04-21, passed 10-
12-2004; Ord. 06-06, passed 5-9-2006)
§ 30.02 PUBLIC RECORDS AVAILABLE.
   (A)   Upon request by any person and subject to division (H) of this
section, all public records responsive to the request shall be promptly
prepared and made available for inspection to the requester at all reasonable
times during regular business hours. Subject to division (H) of this section,
upon request by any person, a public office or person responsible for public
records shall make copies of the requested public record available to the
requestor at cost and within a reasonable period of time. If a public record
contains information that is exempt from the duty to permit public inspection
or to copy the public record, the public office or the person responsible for
the public record shall make available all of the information within the public
record that is not exempt. When making that public record available for public
inspection or copying that public record, the public office or the person
responsible for the public record shall notify the requester of any redaction
or make the redaction plainly visible. A redaction shall be deemed a denial of
a request to inspect or copy the redacted information, except if federal or
state law authorizes or requires a public office to make the redaction.
   (B)   To facilitate broader access to public records, a public office or the
person responsible for public records shall organize and maintain public
records in a manner that they can be made available for inspection or copying
in accordance with this section. A public office also shall have available a
copy of its current records retention schedule at a location readily available
to the public. If a requester makes an ambiguous or overly broad request or has
difficulty in making a request for copies or inspection of public records under
this section, such that the public office or the person responsible for the
requested public record cannot reasonably identify what public records are
being requested, the public office or the person responsible for the requested
public record may deny the request but shall provide the requester with an
opportunity to revise the request by informing the requester of the manner in
which records are maintained by the public office and accessed in the ordinary
course of the public office’s or person’s duties.
   (C)   If a request is ultimately denied, in part or in whole, the public
office or the person responsible for the requested public record shall provide
the requester with an explanation, including legal authority, setting forth why
the request was denied. If the initial request was provided in writing, the
explanation also shall be provided to the requester in writing. The explanation
shall not preclude the public office or the person responsible for the
requested public record from relying upon additional reasons or legal authority
in defending an action commenced under R.C. § 149.43(C).
   (D)   Unless specifically required or authorized by state or federal law or
in accordance this section, no public office or person responsible for public
records may limit or condition the availability of public records by requiring
disclosure of the requester’s identity or the intended use of the requested
public record. Any requirement that the requester disclose the requester’s
identity or the intended use of the requested public record constitutes a
denial of the request.
   (E)   A public office or person responsible for public records may ask a
requester to make the request in writing, may ask for the requester’s identity,
and may inquire about the intended use of the information requested, but may do
so only after disclosing to the requester that a written request is not
mandatory and that the requester may decline to reveal the requester’s identity
or the intended use and when a written request or disclosure of the identity or
intended use would benefit the requester by enhancing the ability of the public
office or person responsible for public records to identify, locate or deliver
the public records sought by the requester.
   (F)   If any person requests a copy of a public record in accordance with
this section, the public office or person responsible for the public record may
require the requester to pay in advance the cost involved in providing the copy
of the public record in accordance with the choice made by the requester under
this division. The public office or the person responsible for the public
record shall permit the requester to choose to have the public record
duplicated upon paper, upon the same medium upon which the public office or
person responsible for the public record keeps it, or upon any other medium
upon which the public office or person responsible for the public record
determines that it reasonably can be duplicated as an integral part of the
normal operations of the public office or person responsible for the public
record. When the requester makes a choice under this division, the public
office or person responsible for the public record shall provide a copy of it
in accordance with the choice made by the requester. Nothing in this section
requires a public office or person responsible for the public record to allow
the requester of a copy of the public record to make the copies of the public
record.
   (G)   (1)   Upon a request made in accordance with this section and subject
to division (F) of this section, a public office or person responsible for
public records shall transmit a copy of a public record to any person by United
States mail or by any other means of delivery or transmission within a
reasonable period of time after receiving the request for the copy. The public
office or person responsible for the public record may require the person
making the request to pay in advance the cost of postage if the copy is
transmitted by United States mail or the cost of delivery if the copy is
transmitted other than by United States mail, and to pay in advance the costs
incurred for other supplies used in the mailing, delivery or transmission.
      (2)   Any public office may adopt a policy and procedures that it will
follow in transmitting, within a reasonable period of time after receiving a
request, copies of public records by United States mail or by any other means
of delivery or transmission pursuant to division (G) of this section. A public
office that adopts a policy and procedures under division (G) of this section
shall comply with them in performing its duties under that division.
      (3)   In any policy and procedures adopted under division (G) of this
section:
         (a)   A public office may limit the number of records requested by a
person that the office will physically deliver by United States mail or by
another delivery service to ten per month, unless the person certifies to the
office in writing that the person does not intend to use or forward the
requested records, or the information contained in them, for commercial
purposes.
         (b)   A public office that chooses to provide some or all of its
public records on a web site that is fully accessible to and searchable by
members of the public at all times, other than during acts of God outside the

(assumed and paid to the PERS) by the city. This pick-up by the city is, and
shall be designated as, public employee contributions and shall be in lieu of
contributions to the PERS by each person within any of the classes established
in division (B) of this section. No person subject to this pick-up shall have
the option of choosing to receive the statutorily required contribution to the
PERS directly instead of having it picked up by the city or of being excluded
from the pick-up.
      (2)   The city shall, in reporting and making remittance to the PERS,
report that the public employee’s contribution for each person subject to this
pick-up has been made as provided by the statute.
   (B)   The pick-up by the city provided by this section shall apply to all
persons who are employees of the city who are or become contributing members of
the PERS.

         (b)   An employee’s deferred salary shall be equal to that percentage
of that employee’s total salary which is required, from time to time by the
PERS, to be paid as an employee contribution by that employee, and shall be
paid by the city to the PERS on behalf of that employee as a pick-up and in
lieu of the PERS employee contribution otherwise payable by that employee. An
employee’s cash salary shall be equal to that employee’s total salary less the
amount of the pick-up for that employee, and shall be payable, subject to
applicable payroll deductions, to that employee.
      (2)   The city shall compute and remit its employer contributions to the
PERS based upon an employee’s total salary. The total salaries payable under

   (A)   (1)   Effective July 31, 1994, the full amount of the statutorily
required contributions to the Police and Fire Disability and Pension Fund
(PFDPF) shall be withheld from the gross pay of each person within any of the
classes established in division (B) of this section and shall be picked-up
(assumed and paid to the PFDPF) by the city. This pick-up by the city is, and
shall be designated as, public employee contributions and shall be in lieu of
contributions to the PFDPF by each person within any of the classes established
in division (b) of this section. No person subject to this pick-up shall have
the option of choosing to receive the statutorily required contribution to the
PFDPF directly instead of having it picked up by the city or of being excluded
from the pick-up.
      (2)   The city shall, in reporting and making remittance to the PFDPF,
report that the public employee’s contribution for each person subject to this
pick-up has been made as provided by the statute.
   (B)   The pick-up by the city provided by this section shall apply to all
persons who are employees of the city who are or become contributing members of
the PFDPF.
   (C)   The city’s method of payment of salary to employees who are
participants in the PFDPF is hereby modified as follows, in order to provide
for a salary reduction pick-up of employee contributions to the PFDPF:
      (1)   (a)   The total salary for each employee shall be the salary
otherwise payable under city policies. Such total salary of each employee shall
be payable by the city in two parts:
            1.   Deferred salary; and
            2.   Cash salary.
         (b)   An employee’s deferred salary shall be equal to that percentage
of that employee’s total salary which is required, from time to time by the
PFDPF, to be paid as an employee contribution by that employee, and shall be
paid by the city to the PFDPF on behalf of that employee as a pick-up and in
lieu of the PFDPF employee contribution otherwise payable by that employee. An
employee’s cash salary shall be equal to that employee’s total salary less the
amount of the pick-up for that employee, and shall be payable, subject to
applicable payroll deductions, to that employee.
      (2)   The city shall compute and remit its employer contributions to the
PFDPF based upon an employee’s total salary. The total salaries payable under
applicable city policies and the pick-up provisions of this section shall not
be greater than the amounts it would have paid for those items had this section
not been in effect.
   (D)   The Director of Finance is hereby authorized and directed to implement
the provisions of this section to institute the pick-up of the statutorily
required contributions to the PFDPF for those persons referred to in division
(B) of this section, so as to enable them to obtain the result in federal and
state tax deferments and other benefits.

   (B)   An employee who transfers from another political subdivision or public
agency to a position with the city may transfer any unused balance of sick
leave from his or her previous position to the city, pursuant to the applicable
sections of the Ohio Revised Code. It is the employee’s responsibility to
furnish a written statement from the previous employer certifying the
termination date and the total transferrable accumulated sick leave balance
upon termination.
   (C)   (1)   Any employee who, by reason of age and service, is granted
retirement or disability under the Police and Firemen’s Disability and Pension
Fund, is entitled to a payment in cash for 50% of all accumulated and unused
sick leave. The procedure and calculation of the payment will be based upon the
following:
         (a)   The employee must request, in writing, addressed to the
appointing authority, payment for accrued unused sick leave.
         (b)   Upon receipt of documentation that the retirement or disability
request has been authorized by the Police and Firemen’s Disability and Pension
Fund, the payment will be based upon the employee’s rate of pay at retirement
or disability.
         (c)   Such payment may not exceed 960 hours.
      (2)   In the event of the death of any employee, the employee’s heirs
shall be entitled to receive the same benefit as if the employee retired.
   (D)   Any eligible employee who has used 24 hours or less of accrued sick
leave during an entire calendar year, will earn eight hours of personal leave.
The personal leave must be used during the calendar year immediately following
the year it was earned, may not be carried over and may not be sold back to the
city as leave. An eligible employee is a regular, full-time employee who has
completed one full calendar year of employment with the city.
   (E)   All regular, full-time employees are entitled to paid funeral leave
due to the death of an immediate family member. Immediate family member, as

sibling, grandparent or grandchild of the employee or of his or her spouse.
   (F)   Unused vacation leave and compensatory time accrued by employees may
be sold back to the city by completing the appropriate paperwork and submitting

compensation at his or her current hourly rate, by separate check, in December.
A maximum of 48 hours of compensatory time and 40 hours of vacation leave may
be carried into the next calendar year.

sick leave, funeral leave, sick leave incentive and leave sale compensation
benefits to regular, full-time, nonbargaining employees of the city, in
conformity with this section.
   (H)   Upon separation from employment due to death or retirement, full-time
employees (or their estate, if upon death), shall be compensated, at their

accumulated and unused sick leave, up to a maximum of 960 hours.
(Prior Code, § 258.09) (Res. 95-R83, passed 6-27-1995; Res. 99-R19, passed 4-
13-1999; Res. 01-R37, passed 7-10-2001; Res. 04-R-13, passed 3-23-2004; Res.

§ 32.10 VACATION LEAVE FOR FULL-TIME AND PART-TIME NONBARGAINING EMPLOYEES AND
HOLIDAYS FOR FULL-TIME NONBARGAINING EMPLOYEES.
   (A)   Vacation leave for full-time employees.
      (1)   Eligibility/accrual for full-time employees. Vacation service
credit is based upon years of uninterrupted full-time service with the city.
The following schedule will apply to all full-time employees:
 
Length of Service Weeks of Leave
1 to 4 years      2
5 to 9 years      3
10 to 14 years    4
15 years and over 5
 
      (2)   Crediting of vacation.
         (a)   Each full-time employee will be entitled to accumulate vacation
credits for each paid hour they are in an active pay status based upon a 40-
hour work week. Active pay status includes vacation, sick, personal,
compensatory time, jury duty, holidays, military leave, funeral leave and
approved seminars and training. The hourly accumulation rate per paid hour
follows:
 
Length of Service Hourly Accumulated Rate/ Paid Work Calendar Year Equivalent
                  Hour
0 to 4 years      0.0385                             2 weeks per year
5 to 9 years      0.0577                             3 weeks per year
10 to 14 years    0.0770                             4 weeks per year
15 years and over 0.0962                             5 weeks per year
 
         (b)   There will be a catch-up period in 2016 so as to allow vacation
balances which in the past were credited January 1, to be unaffected by the new
accrual basis. Accrual of hours will be calculated retroactive to January 1,
2016, and will be available to use as they are accrued. The accruals are in
addition to the 2016 vacation allotment previously granted on January 1, 2016.
Example: January 1, 2016, an employee is credited two weeks’ vacation; they
also will earn as of January 1, 2016 vacation based on the new formula of
0.0385 per each hour paid. At the end of 2016 if no vacation hours were used,
the full-time employee would have a four-week vacation balance on January 1,
2017.
      (3)   Length of service adjustment. Each covered full-time employee’s
hourly accumulation rate per paid hour will automatically be adjusted to the
appropriate rate shown in division (A)(2) of this section as the full-time
employee’s service qualifies them for the change.
      (4)   Maximum carry-over for full-time employees. A maximum of 40 hours
plus one year’s accrual of vacation hours may be carried over into the
following year. Any vacation leave in excess of the maximum permitted carryover
is forfeited.
      (5)   Probationary full-time employees. Upon completion of the
probationary period, full-time employees may schedule time off using accrued
vacation.
      (6)   Minimum increments for usage for full-time employees. Full-time
employees are permitted to take vacation leave in minimum increments of one
hour.
      (7)   Vacation sell-back for full-time employees. Full-time employees, by
November 1 of any year, upon approval of the department head, may elect to sell
accumulated but unused vacation leave according to the schedule below, at the
employee’s regular base hourly rate. The amount will be paid in a separate
payroll in December.
 
Vacation Entitlement Maximum Carryover    Maximum That Can Be Sold
2 weeks              1 year plus 40 hours 0 week
3 weeks              1 year plus 40 hours 1 week
4 weeks              1 year plus 40 hours 2 weeks
5 weeks              1 year plus 40 hours 3 weeks
 
      (8)   Vacation severance. Upon termination of city employment (retirement
of any kind, resignation, discharge or death), the employee or the employee’s
estate/designated beneficiary will be paid 100% of the employee’s accrued but
unused vacation at the employee’s then current rate of pay.
   (B)   Part-time vacation leave.
      (1)   Part-time vacation service credit. Part-time employees will earn
vacation service credit on the basis of the amount of hours paid in a given
year prorated to those regularly scheduled hours for full-time personnel (i.e.,
1,040 hours worked equals one-half year of vacation service credit). Upon
appointment to full-time status, a part-time employee will remain eligible for
full-time vacation and be credited with the employee’s prior part-time service
credit on the full-time scale.
      (2)   Part-time vacation eligibility/accrual. Part-time employees will
earn vacation based upon the amount of hours they work in the previous calendar
year; provided that they work a minimum of 500 hours. The maximum annual amount
of vacation available to be earned annually is 40 hours for the prior year’s
service. Part-time employees will be credited up to the maximum amount on the
basis of the amount of hours worked annually prorated to that of a full-time
employee (i.e., 1,040 hours worked equals 20 hours of vacation earned) on
January 1.
   (C)   Holidays. Full-time employees of the city shall be given a day off and
be compensated at their regular hourly rates for each of the following
holidays:
Holiday Date
Holiday                Date

Friday and holidays falling on a Sunday will be observed on the Monday
following the holiday for employees assigned to a standard Monday through
Friday work week. Holidays shall be observed on the dates indicated for those
employees assigned to a nonstandard work week. Employees who are required to
work on a holiday will receive holiday pay and also be compensated for actual
hours worked at the rate of one and one-half times their regular hourly rate of
pay in addition to holiday pay.
      (2)   If an employee who is scheduled to work on a holiday reports off
work due to illness, he or she may not use sick leave for the hours absent from
work. He or she will receive up to eight hours of holiday allowance for that
day, based upon the hours he or she was scheduled to work.
      (3)   The Friday after Thanksgiving is hereby established as a paid
holiday for full-time employees of the city who are not represented by an
existing bargaining unit.
   (D)   Floating holiday. A floating holiday of one eight-hour day is
established as an additional paid holiday to full-time employees not
represented by an existing bargaining unit.

§ 33.005 INVESTMENT POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the policy of the city to invest public funds in a
manner which will provide the highest investment return with the maximum
security, safety and preservation of principal while meeting the daily cash
flow demands of the city and conforming to all applicable statutes governing
the investment of public funds by an Ohio municipality. The Director of Finance
shall be the investment officer for the city, charged with the responsibility
for the purchase and sale of investments, and the carrying out of this
investment policy.
    (B)   Scope. This investment policy applies to all financial assets of the
city, including state and federal funds held by it. The Director of Finance
shall routinely monitor the contents of the city’s investment portfolio, the
available markets and relative value of competing investments, and will adjust
the portfolio accordingly.
    (C)   Prudence.
      (1)   Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under
circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for
speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their
capital, as well as the probable income to be derived.
      (2)   The standard of prudence to be used by the Director of Finance
shall be the prudent person standard and shall be applied in the context of
managing the overall portfolio. Acting in accordance with this investment
policy and exercising due diligence shall relieve the Director of Finance of
personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market
price changes; provided that deviations from expectations are reported to
Council in a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse
developments.
   (D)   Objectives. The primary objectives, in priority order, of the city’s
investment activities, shall be as follows.
      (1)   Safety. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the
investment program. Investments of the city shall be undertaken in a manner
that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To
attain this objective, diversification is required in order that potential
losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the
remainder of the portfolio.
      (2)   Liquidity. The city’s investment portfolio will remain sufficiently
liquid to enable it to meet all operating requirements which might be
reasonably anticipated.
      (3)   Return on investment. The city’s investment portfolio shall be
designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account this investment policy and
the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio.
   (E)   Ethics and conflicts of interest. Persons involved in the investment
process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with
proper execution of the investment program or which could impair their ability
to make impartial investment decisions. Employees and investment consultants
shall disclose to the city any material financial interests in financial
institutions that conduct business within the city and any large personal
financial or investment positions that could be related to, or affected by, the
performance of the city’s portfolio. All employees and officers of, and
investment consultants to, the city shall subordinate their personal investment
transactions to those of the city, particularly with regard to the timing of
purchases and sales.
    (F)   Authorized financial dealers and institutions.
      (1)   The Director of Finance will maintain a list of financial
institutions and approved security brokers/dealers selected by credit
worthiness who or which are authorized to provide investment services and
qualify under R.C. § 135.14(M)(1). These may include primary dealers or
regional dealers who or which qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission
Rule 15c 3-1, being 17 C.F.R. § 240-15c3-1, and are registered with the Ohio
Department of Commerce to do business in the state.
      (2)   All financial institutions and brokers/dealers who or which desire
to become qualified suppliers of investment transactions to the city must
provide the Director of Finance with audited annual financial statements, proof
of good standing with the comptroller of currency or state banking regulators
or National Association of Securities Dealers certification, proof of Ohio
registration, and biographical and regulatory information on the persons who
are the primary contact with the entity. All financial institutions, brokers/
dealers and consultants who or which desire to conduct investment business with
the city must sign this investment policy, certifying that they have read it,
understand it and agree to abide by its contents.
      (3)   The Director of Finance shall receive prior approval by majority
vote of City Council to effectuate a transfer of city accounts presently held
by financial institutions to new financial institutions for those funds held
pursuant to this section.
   (G)   Authorized investments. The city is empowered by statute to invest in
the following types of securities:
      (1)   United States Treasury bills, notes, bonds or any other obligation
or security issued by the United States Treasury or any other obligation
guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States;
      (2)   Bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations or securities issued
by any federal government agency or instrumentality, including, but not limited
to, the Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal
Farm Credit Bank, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Government National
Mortgage Association and Student Loan Marketing Association. All such
securities shall be direct issuances of federal government agencies or
instrumentalities;
      (3)   Interim deposits in duly authorized depositories of the city;
provided that such deposits are properly insured or collateralized as required
by law;
      (4)   Bonds and other obligations of the state;
      (5)   No-load money market mutual funds consisting exclusively of
securities as described in divisions (G)(1) and (G)(2) of this section, and
repurchase agreements secured by such obligations; provided that all such
investments under this division (G)(5) shall be made with a bank or savings and
loan association eligible to be a depository for public funds of Ohio
subdivisions; and provided further that any such fund meets the requirements of
R.C. Ch. 135, including that such fund not include any investment in a
derivative;
      (6)   Ohio Subdivision’s Fund (STAROhio); and
      (7)   Overnight or term (not exceeding 30 days) repurchase agreements
meeting the requirements of R.C. § 135.14(E), with a bank or savings and loan
association eligible to be a depository for public funds of Ohio subdivisions
or a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers.
   (H)   Diversification. The city will diversify its investments by security,
type and institution.
    (I)   Maximum maturities. To the extent possible, the city will attempt to
match its investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. No investment
shall be made unless the Director of Finance, at the time of making the
investment, reasonably expects it can be held to its maturity. Unless matched
to a specific obligation or debt of the city, the city will not directly invest
in securities as set forth in divisions (G)(1) to (G)(5) of this section
maturing more than five years from the date of settlement if such securities
bear interest at a fixed rate, and it will not directly invest in such
securities maturing more than two years from the date of settlement if they
bear interest at a variable rate.
   (J)   Safekeeping and custody. All security transactions, including
securities acquired subject to repurchase agreements, entered into by the city,
shall be conducted on a delivery-versus-payment basis. Purchased securities
will be held by a third party custodian, designated by the Director of Finance,
that is a Federal Reserve Bank or other qualified trustee within the meaning of
R.C. § 135.18(J), and the safekeeping of those securities for the benefit of
the city shall be evidenced by safekeeping receipts. Purchased securities shall
be released by the city only upon verification that the principal and interest,
or proceeds of sale of the securities, have been credited to the city’s
account.
   (K)   Prohibited investment practices. In addition to any other prohibitions
in the Ohio Revised Code, the city shall not:
      (1)   Contract to sell securities that have not yet been acquired on the
speculation that prices will decline;
      (2)   Make any investment in DERIVATIVES as defined in R.C. § 135.14(C);
      (3)   Invest in a fund established by another public body for the purpose
of investing public money of other subdivisions, unless the fund is either
STAROhio or a fund created solely for the purpose of acquiring, constructing,
owning, leasing or operating municipal utilities as authorized under R.C. §
715.02 or § 4 of Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution;
      (4)   Enter into reverse repurchase agreements;
      (5)   Leverage current investments as collateral to purchase other
assets; and
      (6)   Invest in stripped principal or interest obligations of otherwise
eligible obligations.
   (L)   Internal controls. The Director of Finance shall develop and maintain
procedures for the operation of the city’s investment program in accordance
with this investment policy. These procedures shall be designed to prevent loss
of the city’s funds due to fraud, error, misrepresentation, unanticipated
market changes or imprudent actions.
   (M)   Reporting.
      (1)   The Director of Finance shall maintain a current inventory of all
investments including:
         (a)   A description of each security;
         (b)   The cost;
         (c)   Par value;

and/or continuing education training programs sponsored by the State Treasurer
or the State Auditor in which the Director of Finance is required to
participate pursuant to R.C. §§ 117.44, 135.22 and 733.27. Through
participation in those programs, the Director of Finance will develop and
maintain an enhanced background and working knowledge in investment, case
management and ethics.
    (O)   Nonbinding arbitration. The Director of Finance may enter into a
written investment or deposit agreement that includes a provision under which
the parties agree to submit to nonbinding arbitration (but not binding
arbitration) to settle any controversy that may arise out of that agreement so
long as such provision meets the requirements of the Ohio Revised Code and is
specifically approved by the Council.
   (P)   Investment policy adoption. This investment policy shall be adopted by
Council and, upon adoption, filed in the office of the State Auditor. The
policy shall be reviewed on an annual basis by Council or a committee

alterations shall be presented to Council by resolution.
   (D)   Any acquisition, construction or improvement which involves an
expenditure of less than the current bidding threshold, as determined above,
shall be made in accordance with the Department of Finance purchasing policy, a

City Charter, City Council hereby authorizes the Mayor to advertise for and
award single aggregate bids for the erection, repair, alteration or rebuilding
of a public building when the estimate for the improvement is under $500,000.
Nothing in this provision shall be deemed to eliminate the discretion of the
Mayor to advertise for and award separate bids for components of any
improvement that is under $500,000.
      (2)   When the estimate for the improvement is $500,000 or more, the
Mayor shall advertise for a single aggregate bid and separate bids for the

to the lowest and best bidder or bidders.
   (B)   City Council hereby specifically finds and determines that R.C. §§
153.50 to 153.52 shall not be applicable to the city, insofar as they conflict
with the terms of this section.
   (C)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the city from
advertising for and awarding separate bids for each separate trade or kind of
mechanical labor, employment or business, or for furnishing materials for the
erection, repair, alteration or rebuilding of a public building if the
combination of the necessary separate bids constitute the lowest and best bids
as determined by City Council.
(Prior Code, § 210.07) (Ord. 99-11, passed 9-28-1999)
§ 35.08 CONTRACTS FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICE.
   (A)   The Mayor shall submit for Council approval, all future contracts for

IDENTITY THEFT POLICY
§ 35.20 BACKGROUND.
   The risk to the city, its employees and customers from data loss and
identity theft is a significant concern to the city and can be reduced only
through the combined efforts of every employee and contractor.
(Prior Code, § 216.01) (Res. 2008-R63, passed 11-25-2008)
§ 35.21 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The city adopts this sensitive information policy to help protect
employees, customers, contractors and the city from damages related to the loss
or misuse of sensitive information.
   (B)   This policy will:
      (1)   Define sensitive information;
      (2)   Describe the physical security of data when it is printed on paper;
      (3)   Describe the electronic security of data when stored and
distributed; and
      (4)   Place the city in compliance with state and federal law regarding
identity theft protection.
   (C)   This policy enables the city to protect existing customers, reducing
risk from identity fraud and minimize potential damage to the city from
fraudulent new accounts. The program will help the city:
      (1)   Identify risks that signify potentially fraudulent activity within
new or existing covered accounts;
      (2)   Detect risks when they occur in covered accounts;
      (3)   Respond to risks to determine if fraudulent activity has occurred
and act if fraud has been attempted or committed; and
      (4)   Update the program periodically, including reviewing the accounts
that are covered and the identified risks that are part of the program.
(Prior Code, § 216.02) (Res. 2008-R63, passed 11-25-2008)
§ 35.22 SCOPE.
   This policy and protection program applies to employees, contractors,
consultants, temporary workers and other workers at the city, including all
personnel affiliated with third parties.
(Prior Code, § 216.03) (Res. 2008-R63, passed 11-25-2008)
§ 35.23 POLICY.
   (A)   Definition of sensitive information. Sensitive information includes
the following items whether stored in electronic or printed format:

         (b)   Credit card expiration date;
         (c)   Cardholder name; and
         (d)   Cardholder address.
      (2)   Tax identification numbers, including:
         (a)   Social Security number;

      (7)   Municipal personnel are encouraged to use common sense judgment in
securing confidential information to the proper extent. Furthermore, this
section should be read in conjunction with the Ohio Public Records Act, being
R.C. § 149.43, and the city’s open records policy. If an employee is uncertain
of the sensitivity of a particular piece of information, he or she should
contact their supervisor. In the event that the city cannot resolve a conflict
between this policy and the Ohio Public Records Act, the city will consult with
legal counsel.
   (B)   Hard copy distribution. Each employee and contractor performing work
for the city will comply with the following policies.
      (1)   File cabinets, desk drawers, overhead cabinets and any other
storage space containing documents with sensitive information will be locked
when not in use.
      (2)   Storage rooms containing documents with sensitive information and
record retention areas will be locked at the end of each workday or when
unsupervised.
      (3)   Desks, workstations, work areas, printers and fax machines, and
common shared work areas will be cleared of all documents containing sensitive
information when not in use.
      (4)   Whiteboards, dry-erase boards, writing tablets and the like in
common shared work areas will be erased, removed or shredded when not in use.
      (5)   When documents containing sensitive information are discarded, they
will be placed inside a locked shred bin or immediately shredded using a
mechanical cross cut or Department of Defense (DOD)-approved shredding device.
Locked shred bins are labeled “Confidential paper shredding and recycling.”
Municipal records, however, may only be destroyed in accordance with the city’s
records retention policy.
   (C)   Electronic distribution. Each employee and contractor performing work
for the city will comply with the following policies.
      (1)   Internally, sensitive information may be transmitted using approved
municipal e-mail. All sensitive information must be encrypted when stored in an
electronic format.
      (2)   Any sensitive information sent externally must be encrypted and
password protected and only to approved recipients. Additionally, a statement
such as this should be included in the e-mail:
         “This message may contain confidential and/or proprietary information
and is intended for the person/entity to whom it was originally addressed. Any
use by others is strictly prohibited.”
(Prior Code, § 216.04) (Res. 2008-R63, passed 11-25-2008)
§ 35.24 ADDITIONAL IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM.
   (A)   Covered accounts. A covered account includes any account that involves
or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions. Every new and
existing customer account that meets the following criteria is covered by this
program:
      (1)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft; or
      (2)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk to the safety or soundness of the city from
identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation or
litigation risks.
   (B)   Red flags.
      (1)   The following red flags are potential indicators of fraud. Any time
a red flag, or a situation closely resembling a red flag, is apparent, it
should be investigated for verification.
         (a)   Alerts, notifications or warnings from a consumer reporting
agency;
         (b)   A fraud or active duty alert included with a consumer report;
         (c)   A notice of credit freeze from a consumer reporting agency in
response to a request for a consumer report; or
         (d)   A notice of address discrepancy from a consumer reporting agency
as defined in the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, being 15
U.S.C. § 1681a(f), and further defined in 12 C.F.R. § 1022.82(b).
      (2)   Red flags also include consumer reports that indicate a pattern of
activity inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an
applicant or customer, such as:
         (a)   A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
         (b)   An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;
         (c)   A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect
to recently established credit relationships; or
         (d)   An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of
account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
      (3)   Suspicious documents:
         (a)   Documents provided for identification that appear to have been
altered or forged;
         (b)   The photograph or physical description on the identification is
not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
identification;
         (c)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification;
         (d)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the city, such as a
signature card or a recent check; or
         (e)   An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives
the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
      (4)   Suspicious personal identifying information:
         (a)   Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the city. For example:
            1.   The address does not match any address in the consumer report;
            2.   The Social Security number (SSN) has not been issued or is
listed on the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File; or
            3.   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is
not consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and
date of birth.
         (b)   Personal identifying information provided is associated with
known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used
by the city. For example, the address on an application is the same as the
address provided on a fraudulent application;
         (c)   Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly
associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party
sources used by the city. For example:
            1.   The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop or a
prison; or
            2.   The phone number is invalid or is associated with a pager or
answering service.
         (d)   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons
opening an account or other customers;
         (e)   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or
similar to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large
number of other customers or other persons opening accounts;
         (f)   The customer or the person opening the covered account fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete;
         (g)   Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal identifying information that is on file with the city; or
         (h)   When using security questions (mother’s maiden name, pet’s name
and the like), the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot
provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would be
available from a wallet or consumer report.
      (5)   Unusual use of, or suspicious activity related to, the covered
account:
         (a)   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a
covered account, the city receives a request for new, additional, or
replacement goods or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the
account;
         (b)   A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly
associated with known patterns of fraud patterns. For example, the customer
fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent
payments;
         (c)   A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent
with established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:
            1.   Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed
payments; or
            2.   A material change in purchasing or usage patterns.
         (d)   A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably
lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account,
the expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors);
         (e)   Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as
undeliverable although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with
the customer’s covered account;
         (f)   The city is notified that the customer is not receiving paper
account statements;
         (g)   The city is notified of unauthorized charges or transactions in
connection with a customer’s covered account;
         (h)   The city receives notice from customers, victims of identity
theft, law enforcement authorities or other persons regarding possible identity
theft in connection with covered accounts held by the city; or
         (i)   The city is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft,
a law enforcement authority or any other person that it has opened a fraudulent
account for a person engaged in identity theft.
(Prior Code, § 216.05) (Res. 2008-R63, passed 11-25-2008)
§ 35.25 RESPONDING TO RED FLAGS.
   (A)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, an employee must act
quickly as a rapid appropriate response to protect customers and the city from
damages and loss.
      (1)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, gather all
related documentation and write a description of the situation. Present this
information to the designated authority for determination.
      (2)   The designated authority will complete additional authentication to
determine whether the attempted transaction was fraudulent or authentic.
   (B)   If a transaction is determined to be fraudulent, appropriate actions
must be taken immediately. Actions may include:
      (1)   Canceling the transaction;
      (2)   Notifying and cooperating with appropriate law enforcement;
      (3)   Determining the extent of liability of the city; and
      (4)   Notifying the actual customer that fraud has been attempted.
(Prior Code, § 216.06) (Res. 2008-R63, passed 11-25-2008)
§ 35.26 PERIODIC UPDATES TO PLAN.
   (A)   At periodic intervals established in the program, or as required, the
program will be re-evaluated to determine whether all aspects of the program
are up to date and applicable in the current business environment.
   (B)   Periodic reviews will include an assessment of which accounts are
covered by the program.
   (C)   As part of the review, red flags may be revised, replaced or
eliminated. Defining new red flags may also be appropriate.
   (D)   Actions to take in the event that fraudulent activity is discovered
may also require revision to reduce damage to the city and its customers.
(Prior Code, § 216.07) (Res. 2008-R63, passed 11-25-2008)
§ 35.27 PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Involvement of management.
      (1)   The identity theft prevention program shall not be operated as an
extension to existing fraud prevention programs, and its importance warrants
the highest level of attention.
      (2)   The identity theft prevention program is the responsibility of the
governing body. Approval of the initial plan must be appropriately documented
and maintained.
      (3)   Operational responsibility of the program is delegated to the Human
Resources Department.
   (B)   Staff training.
      (1)   Staff training shall be conducted for all employees, officials and
contractors for whom it is reasonably foreseeable that they may come into
contact with accounts or personally identifiable information that may
constitute a risk to the city or its customers.
      (2)   The Human Resources Department is responsible for ensuring identity
theft training for all requisite employees and contractors.
      (3)   Employees must receive annual training in all elements of this
policy.
      (4)   To ensure maximum effectiveness, employees may continue to receive
additional training as changes to the program are made.
   (C)   Oversight of service provider arrangements.
      (1)   It is the responsibility of the city to ensure that the activities
of all service providers are conducted in accordance with reasonable policies
and procedures designed to detect, prevent and mitigate the risk of identity
theft.
      (2)   A service provider that maintains its own identity theft prevention
program, consistent with the guidance of the red flag rules and validated by
appropriate due diligence, may be considered to be meeting these requirements.
      (3)   Any specific requirements should be specifically addressed in the
appropriate contract arrangements.
(Prior Code, § 216.08) (Res. 2008-R63, passed 11-25-2008)
CREDIT CARD POLICY
§ 35.40 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this policy is to ensure that any city issued credit card
and/or purchase card are closely monitored to provide for maximum security and
to guard against misuse and/or losses for which the city may be held liable.
This policy is meant to comply with the mandates of Sub House Bill 312 enacted
by the 132nd General Assembly. City use of these cards include circumstances
where a purchase order is not accepted for the needed service, supplies and/or
materials, or are purchased from a vendor who issues a purchase card to be used
in conjunction with a purchase order. The city issued cards are not for
personal use and will not be permitted to be carried by personnel on a regular
basis for any reason.
(Prior Code, § 218.01) (Ord. 2018-27, passed 11-27-2018)
§ 35.41 GENERAL GUIDELINES.
   (A)   The cards are to be kept in the control of the Finance Director or his
or her designee and will be supplied by the Finance Department. The Finance
Director or designee will secure the cards in a safe or in a locked cash box in
a secure drawer.
   (B)   The Finance Director or his or her designee must keep a master list of
all employees who are permitted to use city cards, along with each employee’s
title, a master list of cards and the names that appear on each card, if
applicable, within the department. Both lists must be updated, and the Finance
Director or his or her assignee notified, whenever changes are made. A copy of
both master lists must be on file in the Finance Department and must remain
current.
   (C)   Individuals wanting to use a card must contact the Finance Director or
designee. A log with the card name, date of sign in/out time, signature of
individual using the card and a valid purchase order number is to be kept by
the Finance Director or designee. The Finance Director or designee must initial
each entry on the log indicating approval of the card’s use and the purchase.
   (D)   Regular purchase order policy and procedures must be followed whenever
an individual anticipates using the card. Every purchase using any card must
have a valid purchase order assigned to it before the purchase is legal. The
purchase order must contain the vendor name, the description, account number
and estimated dollar amount. No purchase shall exceed a spending limit of
$1,000 without the express written consent of the Finance Director or designee.
This will assure that sufficient appropriations exist to cover the anticipated
charges. Once an invoice is received, return a copy of the purchase order and
the receipt(s) to the Finance Department to complete the transaction.
   (E)   It is the responsibility of the purchaser to request a receipt with
every purchase and return the receipt with the credit card to the Finance
Department. If the card is used for an internet purchase, the purchaser must
print the confirmation, invoice and billing information at the time of the
purchase and return to the Finance Department.
   (F)   The user must immediately advise the Finance Director if the card is
damaged, lost or stolen.
   (G)   Please be conscious of the sales tax exempt status, particularly on
lodging and other major expenses. The Finance Department will print the tax
exempt forms as needed.
(Prior Code, § 218.02) (Ord. 2018-27, passed 11-27-2018)
§ 35.42 FINANCE DIRECTOR RESPONSIBILITIES.
   (A)   Determining who should receive a card. The Finance Director or
designee shall review, approve and determine when a credit card or purchase
card account will be opened. Cards will be issued to city employees only.
   (B)   Retrieving cards from employees. The Finance Director or designee will
retrieve cards from employees who resign from the city, change departments or
transfer to a position which no longer requires the use of a card.
   (C)   Overseeing appropriate use of a card. The Finance Director or
designees will:
      (1)   Review all card transactions and management reports to ensure that
the card is being used appropriately; and
      (2)   Ensure all transactions are marked “Viewed” and “Approved” prior to
recording in the general ledger.
   (D)   Ensuring documentation requirements are met. The Finance Director or
designees will:
      (1)   Ensure necessary detail and documentation are provided on all
transactions;

kept in accordance with the city’s records retention schedule; and
      (3)   Make an annual report to the legislative authority to the city for
all rewards received based on the use of the card.
(Prior Code, § 218.03) (Ord. 2018-27, passed 11-27-2018)
§ 35.43 RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR USE.
   (A)   The card is for city business expenses only. It must not be used for
personal purchases. The card is not transferable. It may be used by the
cardholder only. Itemized receipts must be obtained for all transactions.
   (B)   Dividing one purchase into two or more, in order to stay within your
transaction limit, is not permitted. Cardholders may not receive cash advances.
   (C)   Cardholders are responsible for resolving discrepancies for that
transaction(s) and ensuring credits are received in a timely manner. Any
discrepancies must be reported to the Finance Director or designee. Cardholders
may not receive cash back or in-store credits for any refunds or exchanges. The
refund amount must be a credit applied to the card account. If a supplier
mistakenly issues a refund check, it must be submitted to the Finance
Department.
   (D)   The city is exempt from Ohio sales tax. Cardholders should not pay
Ohio sales tax. The cardholder shall supply a tax exempt form to the supplier
before the card is charged. A copy of the city’s tax exempt form is available
for the supplier.
   (E)   If grant funds are being charged, cardholders are responsible for
completing the requirements for the grant agency.
   (F)   Cardholders may not make purchases that violate the city’s policy for
restricting business transactions that may be perceived as a conflict of
interest (purchases from a business in which individuals or their relatives
have a financial interest).
(Prior Code, § 218.04) (Ord. 2018-27, passed 11-27-2018)
§ 35.44 DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Itemized receipts. Employees must obtain an itemized receipt for every
transaction. If a cash register receipt does not have a description, the
individual must write the description on the receipt. Any transaction without a
properly substantiated receipt is subject to reimbursement to the city by the
employee.
   (B)   Receipts defined. A receipt is defined as an invoice, cash register
receipt, sales slip or packing slip which contains an itemized list of goods
purchased, with dollar amounts, and the name and location of the supplier. An
employee of the supplier must sign handwritten receipts.
   (C)   Purchases made in person. Retain the itemized receipt, in addition to,

         (c)   Print out of the e-mail confirmation.
      (2)   The user must immediately advise the Finance Director if a card is
damaged, lost, stolen or the subject of suspected fraudulent activity.
(Prior Code, § 218.05) (Ord. 2018-27, passed 11-27-2018)
§ 35.45 PREVENTING FRAUD.
   The cardholder should use basic security measures, as outlined below, to
guard against fraud:

   (B)   Save receipts and statements in a secure area (these may contain the
card number);
   (C)   Keep the card in view during the transaction and retrieve it as soon

§ 36.03 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (A)   Rate; income taxed.
      (1)   For the purposes specified in §
36.01, an annual tax shall be imposed on and after January 1, 2004, at the rate
of 2% per annum upon the following:
         (a)   On all salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation
earned or paid during the effective period of this chapter by residents of the
city;
         (b)   On all salaries and wages earned through employment with the
city during the effective period of this chapter;
         (c)   On all salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation
earned for work performed on city property when the property is located in a
governmental subdivision where there is no municipal or joint economic
development district income tax levied;
         (d)   On all salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation
earned or paid during the effective period of this chapter by nonresidents for
work done or services performed or rendered in the city;
         (e)   On the portion attributable to the city of the net profits
earned during the effective period of this chapter by all resident
unincorporated businesses, professions or other entities, derived from sales
made, work done, services performed or rendered and business or other
activities conducted in the city;
         (f)   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits
earned during the effective period of this chapter by a resident, partner or
owner of a resident unincorporated business entity, or a resident stockholder
of a resident S-corporation not attributable to the city and not levied against
such unincorporated business entity or S-corporation;
         (g)   On the portion attributable to the city of the net profits
earned during the effective period of this chapter by all nonresident
unincorporated businesses, professions or other entities, derived from sales
made, work done or services performed or rendered, and business or other
activities conducted in the city, whether or not such unincorporated business
entity has any office or place of business in the city;
         (h)   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits
earned during the effective period of this chapter by a resident partner or
owner of a nonresident unincorporated business entity or a resident stockholder
of a nonresident S-corporation, not attributable to the city and not levied
against such unincorporated business entity or S-corporation, whether or not
such business entities have an office or place of business in the city; and
         (i)   On the portion attributable to the city of the net profits
earned during the effective period of this chapter by all corporations, derived
from sales made, work done, services performed or rendered and business or
other activities conducted in the city, whether or not such corporations have
an office or place of business in the city.
      (2)   Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the
computation of net profits from business activities under divisions (A)(1)(e),
(A)(1)(f), (A)(1)(g), (A)(1)(h) and (A)(1)(i) of this section. All persons
engaged in the rental of real estate shall, when filing their annual return,
complete and file with the Tax Administrator a form obtainable at the income
tax office specifying their tenants’ names, addresses and such other
information as requested, if known.
   (B)   Determination of taxable net profits. The portion of the net profits
attributable to the city of a taxpayer conducting a business, profession or
other entity, both within and without the boundaries of the city, shall be
determined as provided in R.C. § 718.02 and in accordance with the rules and
regulations adopted by the Tax Administrator of the city pursuant to this
chapter.
   (C)   Operating loss carried forward.
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss (including rental losses)
sustained in any taxable year subsequent to August 1, 1992, allocable to the
city may be applied against the portion of the profit of succeeding years
allocable to the city until exhausted, but in no event for more than five
taxable years. No portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back against
net profits of any prior year or applied against any wages, salaries or other
compensation earned as an employee of any employer. A loss in one city may
never off-set the gain in another city. However, a loss in one city may off-set
a business or rental gain in the same city. Failure to allocate an operating
loss or failure to file a return on or before the end of the twelfth month
following the tax year in which a net operating loss was sustained, nullifies
the loss carry-forward privilege.
      (2)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the city in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to
the city.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator shall provide, by rules and regulations, the
manner in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.
   (D)   Consolidated returns.
      (1)   Filing of consolidated returns may be permitted, required or denied
in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the city.
      (2)   In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the city
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Tax Administrator shall
require such additional information as he or she may deem necessary to
ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated to the city. If the Tax
Administrator finds that net profits are not properly allocated to the city by
reason of transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by
stock ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity, or by some other method, he or
she shall make such allocations as he or she deems appropriate to produce a
fair and proper allocation of net profits to the city.
   (E)   Exceptions.
      (1)   The tax provided for herein shall not be levied upon the military
pay or allowances of members of the Armed Forces of the United States, or upon
the net profits of any civic, charitable, religious, fraternal or other
organization exempted from the payment of property or income tax under the
provisions of R.C. § 718.01.
      (2)   No provision of this chapter shall be construed as levying this
income tax upon any form of personal or business income, other than those forms
listed in division (A) of this section, or additionally and specifically
exempted in this section.

   (A)   Return required. Each taxpayer, 18 years of age and older, whether or
not a tax is due thereon, must make and file a return on or before April 30 of

of such fiscal year or period.
   (B)   Information required. The return shall be filed with the Tax
Administrator on a form or forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from
the Tax Administrator setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned by him or her, and/or gross income from businesses or
professions, or gross income earned during the preceding year and subject to
such tax;

profits; and

information as the Tax Administrator may require, including copies of the
schedules used for federal income tax or a complete copy of the federal income
tax return.
   (C)   Extension of filing time. The Tax Administrator may extend the time
for filing of the annual return, upon the request of the taxpayer, for a period
not to exceed six months, or three months beyond any extension requested or
granted by the Internal Revenue Service for the filing of the federal income
tax return. The Tax Administrator may require a tentative return accompanied by
payment of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon by the date the return is
normally due and the final tax paid within the period as extended.
   (D)   Payment of tax; deductions. The taxpayer making a return shall, at the
time of filing thereof, pay to the Income Tax Division the amount of taxes
shown as due thereon; provided, however, that where any portion of the tax so
due shall have been deducted at the source pursuant to the provisions of §
36.05, or where any portion of such tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer
pursuant to the provisions of §
36.06, or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality or to a
joint economic development district, credit for the amount so paid in
accordance with §
36.15 shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance,
if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing of such return.
   (E)   Overpayment. A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which
the city is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his or
her election indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall
be refunded; provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than $5 shall
be collected or refunded. However, such refund request will first satisfy any
previous year’s delinquent liability (including assessments) in the order in
which such taxes and assessments became due, with any balance remaining being
refunded.
   (F)   Amended returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in §§
36.11 and
36.15. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Tax Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer’s city tax liability, such taxpayer shall make
and file an amended city return showing income subject to the city tax based
upon such final determination of federal tax liability, and pay any additional
tax shown due thereon, or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (G)   Income from multiple sources. Any person who receives compensation for
services performed for any employer, in whatsoever form, and in addition
receives income from any business activity (including rental property) or
occupation not subject to withholding under the chapter, must file a

final return; provided that a business loss or other activity (including rental
property) may not be applied against income earned as an employee (W-2 income).

subcontractor applies for a building permit, he or she must supply a city tax
identification number to the Zoning Department as evidence of registration with
the Income Tax Division.
   (I)   Income for services performed in other municipalities. Any resident
who receives compensation for services performed for any employer, in
whatsoever form, in another municipality or joint economic development district
whose tax rate is lower than that of the city must file a declaration of
estimated tax (according to the provisions of § 36.06) and a final return.
   (J)   Occupancy permit applications. At the time a deed holder signs for an
occupancy permit in the city, he or she shall be required to complete a form as
prescribed by the Tax Administrator, giving all information necessary to
determine the city income tax status for all persons living or working at that
address.
(Prior Code, § 880A.04) (Ord. 92-11, passed 7-1-1991; Ord. 95-4, passed 4-11-
1995)
§ 36.05 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (A)   In accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Tax
Administrator, each employer within or doing business within the city who
employs one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission or other compensation
basis, shall deduct (on a calendar-year basis) at the time of payment of such
salary, wage, commission or other compensation, the tax of 1% per annum of the
gross salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation due by such employer
to such employee, and shall, on or before the last day of the month following
the month in which the tax was deducted, make a return and pay to the city the
amount of taxes so deducted, except that if said withholding amounts to less
than $100 per month, payment may be made quarterly, as required by the Tax
Administrator. Such returns shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or
acceptable to the Tax Administrator and shall be subject to the rules and
regulations prescribed therefor by the Tax Administrator. Such employer shall
be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld
whether or not such taxes have in fact been withheld. The Tax Administrator,
for good cause, may require immediate returns and payment to be submitted to
his or her office.
   (B)   Such employer, in collecting such tax, shall be deemed to hold the
same until payment is made by such employer to the city, as a trustee for the
benefit of the city, and any such tax collected by such employer from his or
her employees shall, until the same is paid to the city, be deemed a trust fund
in the hands of such employer; provided, however, that no person shall be
required to withhold the tax on the wages or other compensation paid domestic
servants employed exclusively in or about such person’s residence.
   (C)   On or before January 31 of each year, each employer shall file a
withholding return in a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, setting forth
the names and addresses of all employees from whose compensation the tax was
withheld during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld from
his or her employees and such other information as may be required by the rules
and regulations adopted by the Tax Administrator.
   (D)   On or before February 28 of each year, each individual, business or
business entity who files forms 1099-MISC with the Internal Revenue Service
must also file a copy of such return with the City Income Tax Division.
(Prior Code, § 880A.05) (Ord. 92-11, passed 7-1-1991)
§ 36.06DECLARATIONS.
   (A)   Every person who anticipates any taxable income which is not subject
to §
36.05 or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
(including rental property) subject to the tax imposed by §
36.03, and whose tax on such income amounts to $50 or more, must file a
declaration setting forth such estimated income or the estimated profit or loss
from such business activity, together with the estimated tax due thereon.
However, if a person’s income is wholly from salaries or wages from which the
tax will be withheld and remitted to the city in accordance with §
36.05, such person need not file a declaration.
   (B)   Residents of the city who are employed by an employer located in
another municipality or in a joint economic development district, where the tax
being withheld and paid to such municipality or joint economic development
district is based on a rate less than the tax rate of the city, must file a
declaration setting forth the difference in tax due, if such tax due is $50 or
more, and must make quarterly payments to the city according to division (G) of
this section.
   (C)   Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 30 of each year
during the effective period of this chapter, or within 120 days of the date the
taxpayer becomes subject to the tax for the first time.
   (D)   Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration within 120 days after the beginning of each fiscal year or period
accompanied by a payment equal to one-fourth of the estimated annual tax (if
such tax amounts to $50 or more) shown due thereon, and shall make quarterly
payments of equal amounts according to division (G) of this section.
   (E)   Such declarations shall be filed upon a form furnished by or
obtainable from the Tax Administrator. However, credit shall be taken for the
city tax to be withheld from any portion of such income. In accordance with the
provisions of §
36.15, credit may be taken for tax to be paid to or to be withheld and remitted
to another taxing municipality or to a joint economic development district.
   (F)   The original declaration (or any subsequent amendment thereof) may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment date as
provided for herein.
   (G)   Such declaration of estimated tax to be paid the city shall be
accompanied with a payment equal to one-fourth of the estimated annual tax, and
payments of equal amount shall be made on or before July 31, October 31 and
January 31; provided, however, that in case an amended declaration has been
filed, the unpaid balance shown to be due thereon shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
   (H)   An amended declaration must be filed on or before January 31 of any
year or, in the case of a taxpayer on a fiscal year accounting basis, on or
before the date fixed by regulations of the Tax Administrator, if it appears
that the original declaration made for such year underestimated the taxpayer’s
income by 20% or more. At such time, a payment, which, together with prior
payments is sufficient to pay the taxpayer’s entire estimated liability, shall
be made. If, upon the filing of the return required by §
36.04, it appears that the taxpayer did not pay 80% of such taxpayer’s
liability on or before January 31, or the date fixed by regulations, whichever
is applicable, the difference between 80% of such taxpayer’s liability and the
amount of estimated tax he or she actually paid on or before January 31, or the
date fixed by regulations, whichever is applicable, shall be subject to the
interest and penalty provisions of §§
36.10 and
36.99. However, any taxpayer whose declared and paid tax is equal to or greater
than the tax paid in the previous year shall not be assessed any interest or
penalty for any increased taxes found to be due in the current year.
   (I)   On or before April 30 of the year following that for which such
declaration or amended declaration was filed, an annual return shall be filed,
and any balance which may be due to the city shall be paid therewith in
accordance with the provisions of §
36.04.

copy of the deposit slip shall be forwarded to the Treasurer daily.
   (C)   It shall be the duty of the Tax Administrator to enforce payment of
all taxes owing the city, to keep accurate records for a minimum of five years

   (D)   (1)   The Tax Administrator is hereby charged with the enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter, and is hereby empowered to adopt, promulgate

the collection of taxes and the administration and enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter, including provisions for the re-examination and

Such authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are filed by the
taxpayer for all amounts owed by him or her under the chapter.
      (3)   Failure to make any deferred payment when due shall cause the total

confidential, except for official tax collection purposes, or in accordance

shall bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month or fraction thereof.
   (B)   In addition to interest as provided in division (A) of this section,
penalties are hereby imposed as follows:
      (1)   For failure to pay taxes due (other than taxes withheld), 1.5% per
month, or fraction thereof, or $25, whichever is greater;
      (2)   (a)   For failure to remit taxes withheld from employees, 10% per
month, or fraction thereof, up to a maximum of 100% of the tax due, or $25,
whichever is greater.
         (b)   If an employer required to withhold city taxes as required by
this chapter fails, neglects or refuses to withhold city taxes from employees,
a penalty shall be imposed equal to the sum of the amount of the tax which
should have been withheld, plus 10% per month, or fraction thereof, or $25,
whichever is greater.
      (3)   For failure to file an annual return by the due date of such
return, a penalty of $25 shall be imposed, even if no tax is shown to be due on
such return.
   (C)   No penalty shall be assessed on additional taxes found to be due as
the result of an audit by the City Tax Administrator when a return was timely
filed in good faith and the tax paid thereon within the prescribed time.
   (D)   In the absence of fraud, neither penalty nor interest shall be
assessed on any additional taxes resulting from a federal audit for federal
income tax purposes; provided that an amended return is filed and the
additional tax paid within three months after final determination of the
federal tax liability.
   (E)   The Tax Administrator may abate penalty or interest or both. A
taxpayer may appeal to the Board of Review if abatement is refused.
   (F)   If the taxpayer refuses or neglects to make estimated tax payments as
required, the penalty assessed will be 15% of the actual tax liability due the
city. If the taxpayer makes estimated tax payments, but the total amount paid
is less than 80% of the actual tax liability, the penalty assessed will be 15%
of the difference between 80% of the actual tax liability and the amount paid.
   (G)   If penalty and interest charges have been assessed according to this
section, all payments made will first be applied towards such assessment and
then towards the amount of tax due.

recoverable. Except in cases of fraud, omission of a substantial portion of
income subject to this tax or failure to file a return, an additional
assessment shall not be made after three years from the time of payment of any
tax due hereunder provided; however, that in those cases in which the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the taxpayer have executed a waiver of the
federal statute of limitations, the period within which an additional
assessment may be made by the Tax Administrator shall be three years from the
time of the final determination of the federal tax liability.

   (A)   The tax on income and the withholding tax established by this chapter
are authorized by Article XVIII, § 3 of the Ohio Constitution. The tax on
income and the withholding tax established by this chapter are deemed to be
levied in accordance with, and to be consistent with, the provisions and
limitations of R.C. Ch. 718. This chapter is deemed to incorporate the
provisions of R.C. Ch. 718.
   (B)   The tax is an annual tax levied on the income of every person residing
in or earning or receiving income in the municipal corporation, and shall be
measured by municipal taxable income. The municipality shall tax income at a
uniform rate. The tax is levied on municipal taxable income, as defined herein.

   (A)   To provide funds for the purposes of general municipal operation,
maintenance, new equipment, extensions and enlargement of municipal services
and facilities, capital improvements of the city, community learning centers,
and paying debt charges on securities issued and public obligations occurred to
pay costs related to the above-mentioned purposes, there is levied a tax on
salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation, and on other net profits
as provided in this chapter.
   (B)    For the purposes specified in this section, an annual tax shall be

   (A)   First, funds shall be allocated to defray all expenses of collection,
administration and enforcement of the income tax and the provisions of this
chapter.

appropriated first to capital expenditures, that is, the purchase of property,

longer; provided that if the total expended funds for such capital expenditures
are less than the total funds available for capital expenditures, up to 15% of
the 7% of income tax revenues available annually may be expended for the city’s
parks and recreation special events and programming. Any unused funds shall, on
an annual basis, be assigned to a fund for use only for future capital
expenditures, special events and programming in support of the city’s parks and
recreation program on the same allocation basis set forth in this section. This

equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the municipality’s income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under §
37.047 or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying
wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,

corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer or other payer shall remit to

not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter; and
          (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded
$2,399, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of the municipality in any month of the
preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200. Payments under this division shall be
made to the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each
month.
   (C)   An employer, agent of an employer or other payer shall make and file a
return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent or other payer
from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee’s employer, agent of an employer or
other payer, unless the municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under §
37.105.
   (D)   An employer, agent of an employer or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual’s disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation’s
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer’s, agent’s, or other
payer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer or other payer to
remit to the municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax, unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)   Each employer, agent of an employer or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses and social security numbers of all employees from whose

municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee’s qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer’s or employee’s liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer’s employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer’s control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer’s control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

the following conditions applies:
         (a)   The employee’s principal place of work is located in the

      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee’s principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick

tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee’s principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the 20-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first 20 days to the municipal corporation in which the employee’s principal

for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer’s fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in §
37.016. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer’s federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
   (F)   Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of §
37.046.
   (G)   (1)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a
petroleum refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on
income, an employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the
qualifying wages of such a person if the person performs those services on 12
or fewer days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the
employer is located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes
a tax applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on
those days, and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation
for tax on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this
division (G), a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial
classification code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
      (2)   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar
year, the number of days an individual performs personal services at a

municipal corporation for the first 12 days for which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar
year on which the individual performed services at the refinery.

providing the name, address and Social Security number of the person from whose
winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such deduction
and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of the winnings
from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino gaming that
resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by the Tax
Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit electronically

month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before January 31, a casino operator shall file an

amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid; and
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person’s winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)   If a person’s prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by § 6041 of
the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall

lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be

thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before January 31, each video lottery terminal
sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax
Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is located
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with the annual

monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall be indicated
on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before January 31, a video lottery sales agent

Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of each information return
issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may require that such copies
be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted

deducted and withheld.

terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent

are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld, and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person’s prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:

      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (C)(2) of this section

liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may

      (2)   A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
      (3)   The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authotized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
      (4)   After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies
to every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
      (5)   Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
   (K)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (A) of
this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (I) of this section:
      (1)   For the purpose of division (A)(1) of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
      (2)   For the purpose of division (A)(2) of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
      (3)   For the purpose of division (A)(3) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (D) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
   (L)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a tax
administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or a
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (B) of this section. However, a tax administrator shall
not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it would
require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in that municipal corporation.
   (M)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, nothing in this section
is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages pursuant to
§
37.046.

unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      AFFILIATED GROUP OF CORPORATIONS. An affiliated group as defined in §
1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a group includes at

business of providing local exchange telephone service in this state, the
affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange carrier that
would otherwise be included in the group.
      CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. A consolidated return filed for
federal income tax purposes pursuant to § 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME. The consolidated taxable income of
an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the purposes of filing a

   (B)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year:
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election, unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law;
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period, unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (B)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under R.C. § 718.80, a
valid election made by the taxpayer under division (B)(1) or (B)(2) of this
section is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder of the five-year
period.
      (5)   When an election made under R.C. § 718.80 is terminated, a valid
election made under R.C. § 718.86 is binding upon the Tax Administrator for the
remainder of the five-year period.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm’s length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission
from the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (E)(3) and (E)
(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in §
37.016, by substituting consolidated federal taxable income for federal taxable
income wherever federal taxable income appears in that division, and by
substituting an affiliated group of corporations for a C corporation wherever a
C corporation appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under §
37.016 to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to
the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity’s net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
37.061, exclude the property, payroll and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group; or
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
37.061, include the property, payroll and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity’s net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in §
37.061, exclude the property, payroll and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation; and
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under §
37.061 by substituting consolidated federal taxable income attributable to for
net profit from wherever net profit from appears in that section, and by
substituting affiliated group of corporations for taxpayer wherever taxpayer
appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   The municipality, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable
credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding 15 years.
Before the municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of
the credit.

DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX
§ 37.075 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      ESTIMATED TAXES. The amount that the taxpayer reasonably estimates to be
the taxpayer’s tax liability for a municipal corporation’s income tax for the
current taxable year.
      TAX LIABILITY. The total taxes due to a municipal corporation for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (B)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section, the following apply.
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, on the date of the timestamp assigned by the first electronic
system receiving that payment. For purposes of this section, receiving that
payment refers to the transfer of funds from the account of the taxpayer. Such
funds are considered transferred and no longer under the control of the
taxpayer once the timestamp has occurred. As used in this division, DATE OF THE
POSTMARK means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (c)   A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than 12 months shall
make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (d)   Taxes withheld by a casino operator or by a lottery sales agent
under R.C. § 718.031 are deemed to be paid to the municipal corporation for
which the taxes were withheld on the date the taxes are withheld from the
taxpayer’s winnings.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under §
37.105(G) or on or before April 15 of the first taxable year after the taxpayer
becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before April 15 after the beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before April 15 after the beginning of the taxable year,
22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before June 15 after the beginning of the taxable year,
45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before September 15 after the beginning of the taxable
year, 67.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year; and
         (d)   For an individual, on or before January 15 of the following
taxable year, 90% of the tax liability for the taxable year. For a person other
than an individual, on or before December 15 of the taxable year, 90% of the
tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in division (C)(1)(a)
through (C)(1)(d) above.
      (3)   On or before April 15 of the year following that for which the
declaration or amended declaration was filed, an annual return shall be filed
and any balance which may be due shall be paid with the return in accordance
with §
37.105.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to R.C. § 5747.08(G).
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on April 15 following the end of the taxable year or
period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer’s
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to §
37.125 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that

tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment; and
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due;
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year; provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the municipal
corporation under §
37.105 for that year; or
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the municipality but
was not domiciled there on January 1 of the calendar year that includes the
first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

CREDIT FOR TAX PAID
§ 37.090 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (A)   Where a resident of the municipality is subject to a municipal income
tax in another municipality or an income tax in a joint economic development
district, he or she shall not pay a total combined municipal income tax in a
joint economic development district income tax on the same income greater than
the municipal income tax or the joint economic development district income tax
imposed at the higher rate.
   (B)   Every individual taxpayer who is a resident of the municipality and
received net profits, salaries, wages, commissions, or other personal service
compensation for work done or services performed or rendered outside of the
municipality, if it is shown that he or she has paid municipal or joint
economic development district income tax on the same income taxable under this
chapter, shall receive a credit of the amount so paid by him or her, or on his
or her behalf, to such other municipality or joint economic development
district. The credit shall not exceed the tax assessed by this chapter on such
income earned or paid in such other municipality or municipalities or joint
economic development district or districts where such tax is paid.

unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN. A compensation plan described in
§ 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      QUALIFYING LOSS.
         (a)   Except as provided subsection (b) below, the excess, if any, of
the total amount of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan over the total amount of income the
taxpayer has recognized for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years
on a cumulative basis as compensation with respect to the taxpayer’s receipt of
money and property attributable to distributions in connection with the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the QUALIFYING LOSS is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in this subsection computed
without regard to this subsection and a fraction the numerator of which is the
portion of such compensation on which the taxpayer has paid income tax to one
or more municipal corporations, and the denominator of which is the total
amount of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      QUALIFYING TAX RATE. The applicable tax rate for the taxable year for the
which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with respect to
any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which is
deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the QUALIFYING TAX RATE is
a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall be
based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect to
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation’s proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer’s qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee’s failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer’s terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

§ 37.092 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   A municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under R.C. § 715.691, or a joint economic development district created under
R.C. §§ 715.70, 715.71 or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to §
37.090.

§ 37.093 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in § 35.110.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in §
37.110, the municipality will allow a nonrefundable credit equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
municipality claims is due. If the municipality’s tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carry-forward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in §
37.110 of this chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section 37.090 regarding
any limitation on credit shall prevail.

which the credit is requested at a qualifying post-secondary institution.
Students shall also be eligible to receive the credit if they are enrolled at

taking 2% of the first $15,000 of the taxable income. Residents applying for
the tax credit shall be required to complete and sign a disclosure and
authorization form that may be obtained from the municipality’s Income Tax
Division. No person shall receive this tax credit for more than five years. No
person shall receive this tax credit if their college tuition is reduced by
employer tuition reimbursements or employer tuition assistance programs.
Further, residents applying for the tax credit shall be required to disclose
any such employer tuition reimbursements received that reduce their tuition
costs as full-time students.

§ 37.105 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   (1)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
municipal taxable income by the municipality shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the municipality under §
37.046(C) when the nonresident individual taxpayer’s sole income subject to the
tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, and no additional tax is due to the municipality.
      (3)   All resident individual taxpayers, 18 years of age and older, shall
file an annual municipal income tax return with the municipality, regardless of
income or liability.
   (B)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent’s executor,
administrator or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual’s duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary or other person.
   (D)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed
and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall

and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer’s Social Security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer’s Internal
Revenue Service Form W-2, “Wage and Tax Statements,” including all information
reported on the taxpayer’s federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service
Form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service Form 1041, Form 1065, Form 1120, Form 1120-
REIT, Form 1120F or Form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or a
portal provided by municipality. The Department of Taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio Business Gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The Department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer’s
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under R.C. §
5747.08(G). The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on forms
prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the municipality or Tax Administrator. A municipal
corporation shall not require a qualifying employee whose income consists
exclusively of exempt income described in §
37.016 to file a return under this section.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax
Administrator on or before April 15 following the end of the taxpayer’s taxable
year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on
forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the municipality or Tax Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is $10 or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom §
37.106 applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts
with any provision in §
37.106, the provision in §
37.106 prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is $10 or less.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (H)(3) of this section, any taxpayer
not required to remit tax to the municipality for a taxable year pursuant to
division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the municipality an annual net
profit return under divisions (F)(3) and (F)(4) of this section.
      (3)   A municipal corporation shall not require a person to file a net
profit return under this section if the person’s income consists exclusively of
exempt income described in §
37.016.
   (I)   (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
THE DATE OF POSTMARK means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is made by electronic funds transfer, the payment
shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp assigned by the
first electronic system receiving that payment. For purposes of this section,
receiving that payment refers to the transfer of funds from the account of the
taxpayer. Such funds are considered transferred and no longer under the control
of the taxpayer once the timestamp has occurred.
   (J)   The amounts withheld for the municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer or other payer as described in §
37.046 shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits against
payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld were
not remitted to the municipality, and the recipient colluded with the employer,
agent or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts
withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box, the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return, and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer’s refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator of the municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report or document required by the
municipality in accordance with this chapter; provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the municipality or Tax
Administrator; and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
municipality’s ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns, reports
or documents.
   (M)   When income tax returns, reports or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, WORKSITE LOCATION has the same meaning
as in §
37.046.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns, and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter;
         (b)   1.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation’s
income tax for the taxable year.
            2.   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person’s circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement:
         “The affiant has no plans to perform any services within the municipal
corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or otherwise become
subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during the taxable year.
If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a
taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal corporation,
if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation’s resolutions,
ordinances, or rules.”
            3.   The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year, unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
(Prior Code, § 880B.091) (Ord. 2015-15, passed 11-10-2015; Ord. 2016-15, passed
12-13-2016; Ord. 2019-16, passed 10-22-2019)
§ 37.106 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (A)   Each member of the National Guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the Armed Forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member’s or civilian’s
duty service and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or
before the 180th day after the member’s or civilian’s duty terminates. An
applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers
necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant’s active duty or
service terminates. Except as provided in division (B)(3) of this section, the
Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator
considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report or other tax document, nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipality before the 181st day after the applicant’s
active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report or other tax document and an extension of time in which
to make any payment of taxes required by the municipality in accordance with
this chapter. The length of any extension granted under this division (C)(2)(a)
shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that the taxpayer
receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this section, QUALIFYING
TAXPAYER means a member of the National Guard or a member of a reserve
component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to active duty
pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian serving as
support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in support of the
Armed Forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)   For each taxable year to which divisions (A), (B) or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (B)(3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.

§ 37.107 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer’s net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal

filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)   Any employer, agent of an employer or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The state shall not be a party to
the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a municipal
income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing the
authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit and enforce the
provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Prior Code, § 880B.093) (Ord. 2015-15, passed 11-10-2015)
§ 37.108 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be October 15 after the last day
of the taxable year to which the return relates. For tax years ending on or
after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of the municipality's income tax
return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be the 15th day of the
11th month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six months for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer’s municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer’s requested extension.
   (D)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (E)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under R.C. § 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
   (F)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under any division of this section, the tax administrator
shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer with regard to
the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return or on or before
the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs first.
   (G)   If a tax administrator violates division (F) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
   (H)   Division (F) of this section does not apply to an extension received
under division (A) of this section if the tax administrator has actual
knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required
to receive the extension under division (A) of this section or failed to file
for an extension under division (C) of this section.
(Prior Code, § 880B.094) (Ord. 2015-15, passed 11-10-2015; Ord. 2023-13, passed
12-12-2023)
§ 37.109 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is $10 or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer’s consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as provided
under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not reopen
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed
return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment
to the taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return, unless the applicable
statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under §
37.161 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of this
section for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is $10 or less, no refund need be
paid by the municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in division (C)
(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in §
37.110. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this section, the request
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations or attachments that are not
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s
federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations and attachments were
reopened.
(Prior Code, § 880B.095) (Ord. 2015-15, passed 11-10-2015)
§ 37.110 REFUNDS.
   (A)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than $10; and
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds $10.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer’s claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer’s originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
37.160.
   (C)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request;
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request and the request is received within seven days of such last day; and
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §
37.125.
   (E)   As used in this section, WITHHOLDING TAX has the same meaning as in §
37.125.

Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
      (2)   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person

§ 37.141 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)   As used in this section, CLAIM means a claim for an amount payable to
the municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action is
in the best interests of the municipality:

(Prior Code, § 880B.132) (Ord. 2015-15, passed 11-10-2015)
§ 37.142 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator’s
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person’s possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

37.999
§ 37.143 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person’s Social Security number, federal employer identification

person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to §
37.125, in addition to any applicable penalty described in §
37.999.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying
information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to §
37.125.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought, and are in
addition to any applicable criminal penalties described in §
37.999 for a violation of §
37.157, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by

access or disclose such information, except in accordance with a proper

include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an opinion of the Tax Administrator and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G) and (H) of this
section; provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer’s request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the

transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts;
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the municipality in

      (3)   The Tax Administrator’s response is signed by the Tax Administrator

protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator’s opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer’s date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law or the municipality’s

      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law or the municipality’s income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer’s material facts
or circumstances; and
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified

§ 37.159 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail or by a delivery service authorized under
R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in R.C. § 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division (B). A person disputing the presumption of
delivery and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person’s agent or the person’s
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person’s affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by
voting rights, of the addressee’s business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.

§ 37.160 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in R.C. Ch. 718.
      (2)   (a)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
         (b)   Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials or contractors
with the municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the top administrative official of the municipality. This member may be an
employee of the municipality, but may not be the Director of Finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The Board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in R.C. §
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member’s predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member’s
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
   (B)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer’s right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful and shall be filed within 60 days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within 60 days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant or other representative. The Board may allow a hearing to be
continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must
be completed within 120 days after the first day of the hearing unless the
parties agree otherwise.

Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under R.C. § 149.43. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to R.C. § 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.

Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment; and
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the

any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal, an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under §
37.160, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of
the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the amount due from
the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than the amount paid,
there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant’
37.110, with interest on that amount as provided by division (D) of this
section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties

      (1)   Water line flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted stream flows;
rising ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration; uncontaminated
pumped ground water; discharges from potable water sources; foundation drains;
air conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs; water from crawl space
pumps; footer drains; lawn watering; individual residential car washing; flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands; dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;
street wash water; and discharges or flows from firefighting activities. These
discharges are exempt until such time as they are determined by the city to be
significant contributors of pollutants to the MS4;
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the city as being necessary to
protect public health and safety; and

as through highways if they are within the municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (C)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (D)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is

turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.

intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.

provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation

a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.

the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during
the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u-turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;

      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.

flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified

device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (B)   A steady yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (C)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (D)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without

is controlled by traffic control signals shall do all of the following if the
signal facing the driver exhibits no colored lights or colored lighted arrows,
exhibits a combination of such lights or arrows that fails to clearly indicate
the assignment of right-of- way, or, if the vehicle is a bicycle or an electric
bicycle, the signals are otherwise malfunctioning due to the failure of a
vehicle detector to detect the presence of the bicycle or electric bicycle:

entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none, stop
before entering the intersection;

   (A)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (B)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (C)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

pleads guilty to a violation of any provision of this code that is
substantially equivalent to a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, and a court
is permitted or required to suspend a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to
any other penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or non resident operating privileges for
the period of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of
suspension imposed for the violation of the provision of this code shall not
exceed the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for
the violation of the provision of the Ohio Revised Code to which the provision
of this code is substantially equivalent.
(R.C. § 4510.05)
   (B)   Whenever a person is found guilty under the laws of this state or any

license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license on
or about the person’s person shall be prima facie evidence of the person’s not
having obtained a driver’s license.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, whoever
violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.

limited driving privileges.
      (2)   No person shall operate any motor vehicle upon a highway or any
public or private property used by the public for purposes of vehicular travel

or 4510.16, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court, in
addition to or independent of any other sentence that it imposes upon the

      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under R.C. § 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order from
the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar shall
accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any

certified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into

jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise

imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit

pleaded guilty to one or more violations of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was
expired for more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may
impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial
driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or
nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)

is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture under this division is assigned
or transferred and R.C. § 4503.234(B)(2) or (B)(3) applies, the court may fine
the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the
National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds from any fine so imposed

with electronic monitoring under division (B)(1) or (B)(2) of this section
unless, within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written

where the offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender
will not be able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following
the date of sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that

   (A)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left

right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;

   (B)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         (a)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         (b)   When preparing for a left turn;

slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (C)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the

(D)(1)(a) of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of $150 under
division (D)(1)(a) of this section and the assessment of points under division

against that offender’s driver’s license if the offender submits the written
evidence to the court within 90 days of the violation of division (A) of this
section. However, successful completion of the course does not result in a
dismissal of the charges for the violation, and the violation is a prior
offense under divisions (D)(1)(b) and (D)(1)(c) of this section if the offender
commits a subsequent violation or violations of division (A) of this section
within two years of the offense for which the course was completed. This
division does not apply with respect to any offender in the category of

be assessed for a violation of division (A) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (E)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (F)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall

withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in R.C. §
2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
         (b)   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) or
(B) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (A)(1)(b), (A)(1)
(c), (A)(1)(d) and (A)(1)(e) of this section or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance specified for a violation of division (A)(1)(j) of this
section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (B) of this
section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (D)(1)(b) of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under §
73.02, shall state that the person may have an independent test performed at
the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical
test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the
chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.

from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (D)(4)(b) of this section.

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.

within 60 days of sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written
finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail
where the offender is required to serve the term, the offender will not be able
to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing, the court may impose an alternative sentence as specified in R.C. §

         COMMUNITY ADDICTION SERVICES PROVIDER. Has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 5119.01.
         PHYSICAL CONTROL. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4511.194.
      (2)   Any person who operates a vehicle upon a highway or any public or
private property used by the public for vehicular travel or parking within this
municipality or who is in physical control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have
given consent to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine if
arrested for a violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), §
73.03, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (A)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (A)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Any person who is dead or unconscious, or who otherwise is in a
condition rendering the person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed to have
consented as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, and the test or tests
may be administered, subject to R.C. §§ 313.12 through 313.16.
      (5)   (a)   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (d),
or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (C) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (A)(3) and (A)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         (b)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (A)(5)(a) of this section, the law enforcement
officer who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to
this division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
   (B)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, the arresting
law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance with this section to
any person under arrest for a violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), §
73.03, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance. The officer shall
give that advice in a written form that contains the information described in
division (C) of this section and shall read the advice to the person. The form
shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest
and read to the person by the arresting officer. One or more persons shall
witness the arresting officer’s reading of the form, and the witnesses shall
certify to this fact by signing the form. The person must submit to the
chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the arresting officer,
within two hours of the time of the alleged violation and, if the person does
not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour time limit, the failure to
submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, if a person is
under arrest as described in division (B) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the following form
to the person:
You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state law or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state OVI, and, if
you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken at
your own expense.
   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in division (B) of this section or division (A)(5) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately forward it
to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the
arrested person is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is
not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it
to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after
the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the
license or permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge.
Upon receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (B) of this section
to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, if
the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of the
consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of §
73.03, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
person submits to the test or tests and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting officer
shall do all of the following:
         (a)   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         (c)   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
         (d)   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for being
in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
            3.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that the
officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests, advised
the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the form
described in division (C) of this section;
            4.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
            5.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (A)(5)
of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
      (2)   Division (E)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of §
73.03, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who
is asked by a law enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests
under this section, and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance that the test results indicate is present in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
   (F)   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
   (G)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section
is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197 relative to any
suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered by the
report.
(R.C. § 4511.192)
   (H)   (1)   A suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege under this section for the
time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) is effective immediately from the
time at which the arresting officer serves the notice of suspension upon the
arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person is not guilty of the
charge that resulted in the person’s being requested to take the chemical test
or tests under division (A) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (2)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle in violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other municipal OVI
ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in violation of §
73.03 or R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
regardless of whether the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. §
4511.191(B) or (C) or R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the
charge resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons’
arrest or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any
continuance granted by the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the
issues specified in that section.

§ 74.54 WEIGHING OF VEHICLE; REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOAD.
   (A)   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a
vehicle and its load is unlawful may require the driver of the vehicle to stop
and submit to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable,
sealed scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways; a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
highway vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location,
having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined
load of all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway
vehicle; or a sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or
unloaded.
   (B)   The driver of the vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed
to the nearest available sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided the
scales are within three miles of the point where the vehicle is stopped.
   (C)   Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the
police officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as
prescribed by this section.
   (D)   All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and its
load shall be annually compared by a municipal, county or state sealer with the
state standards or standards approved by the state, and the scales shall not be
sealed if they do not conform to the state standards or standards approved by
the state.
   (E)   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a
straight approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and
width to insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, they shall always be used on a level terrain of sufficient length and
width to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. Such terrain shall be
level, or if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in
elevation between the wheels on any one axle does not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed one-quarter
inch per foot of the distance between such axles.
   (F)   In all determinations of all weights, except gross weight, by compact,
self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the
wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, 12 feet or less
apart, shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one such scale under the
outside wheel of each such axle. In determinations of gross weight by the use
of compact, self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to
determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be weighed
simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside wheel of each axle.
   (G)   Whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that
the weight is unlawful, he or she may require the driver to stop the vehicle in
a suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed
as is necessary to reduce the weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted
under R.C. §§ 5577.01 through 5577.14 and this chapter.

§ 76.14 WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (A)   The County Sheriff, upon notification to the County Sheriff of such

motor vehicle, including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. §
4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the Police chief as a result of the
performance of the County Sheriff’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the County

when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:

   (B)   If the County Sheriff issues an order under division (A) of this

the identity of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into
storage by the County Sheriff within five business days of the removal of the
vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the County Sheriff shall send or cause
to be sent to the owner and any lienholder at the owner’s and any lienholder’s
last known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested,
by certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner and any lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   (a)   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible
for payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal and storage and
may reclaim the motor vehicle upon payment of those expenses or charges, and
presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a certificate of
title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of
registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon presentation of
proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of the motor vehicle

vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the

      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (D)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the County Sheriff, without
charge to any party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which
the place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the
requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk,
without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances, to the County Sheriff. If the vehicle is to be
disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in
R.C. § 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the County
Sheriff shall execute in triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles, describing the motor vehicle and the manner in
which it was disposed of, and that all requirements of this section have been
complied with. The County Sheriff shall retain the original of the affidavit
for the County Sheriff’s records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the
affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer, the clerk of courts, within 30
days of the presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (E)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (F)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (G)   Abandonment of junk motor vehicle prohibited.
      (1)   (a)   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63 on private property for more than 72 hours
without the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the County
Sheriff of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
         (b)   For purposes of this division (G)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         (c)   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (G) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.

§ 76.15 PARKING PROHIBITIONS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY; PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (A)   (1)   The Sheriff or Chief of Police, upon complaint of any person
adversely affected, may order into storage any motor vehicle, other than an
abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left
on private residential or private agricultural property for at least four hours
without the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property. The Sheriff or Chief of Police, upon complaint of a repair garage or
place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, other than an
abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left at the garage or place of
storage for a longer period than that agreed upon. When ordering a motor
vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the Sheriff or Chief of Police
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (A)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the Sheriff or Chief of Police not more than two hours after the time it is
removed from the private property, unless the towing service is unable to
deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force,
natural disaster, or other event that is not within the power of the towing
service.
      (3)   Subject to division (B) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle
only in accordance with division (D) of this section.
      (4)   As used in this section, PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY means private
property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a home,
residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than three
separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. The phrase
does not include any private property on which is located one or more
structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by two or more
persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in the structure
or structures.
   (B)   (1)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been
ordered into storage pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section arrives after
the motor vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual
removal from the property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator
oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the

      (2)   (a)   A junk motor vehicle that is left uncovered in the open on
private property for more than 72 hours with the permission of the person
having the right to possession of the property is declared a nuisance and shall
be abated in accordance with the provisions of this section. A junk motor
vehicle may only be excepted from this section if the person is operating a
junk yard or scrap metal processing facility licensed under the authority of
R.C. §§ 4737.05 through 4737.12, or otherwise regulated under authority of a
political subdivision; or if the property on which the motor vehicle is left is
not subject to licensure or regulation by any governmental authority, unless

that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide commercial operation; or if the
motor vehicle is a licensed and operable collector’s vehicle.
         (b)   The municipality shall not prevent a person from storing or
keeping, or restrict him or her in the method of storing or keeping any
collector’s vehicle on private property with the permission of the person
having the right to the possession of the property, except that the

of being enclosed in a building or garage, fence, vegetation, terrain, or other

days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (B)   (1)   After a motor vehicle has been determined to be a junk motor
vehicle, as provided herein, and the same has not been removed after proper
notice, law enforcement shall cause the junk motor vehicle to be removed from

the offensive weeds or grass and shall require the owner or person in
possession or control to reimburse the city for all expenses incurred in
connection with the destruction of such weeds or grass.
      (2)   Notice to the owner or person in possession or control of such lot
or land shall be served by sending it to his or her address by certified mail
or by other mail tracking delivery service and shall be posted on the lot or

section, the Zoning Division shall forward the expenses to the Finance

the weeds, including therein the costs of inspection, record research,
notification and billing. A schedule of such costs shall be on file in the
Zoning Director’s office.

owner or person in possession or control is not known, the Finance Department
shall refer the matter to the Law Director, including a statement of all
charges for city services, the amount paid for the performance of the labor and
the fees of the officers who made the service of the notice and return.
      (2)   Upon receipt of such statement of expenses incurred, the Law
Director shall make written return to the County Auditor of the action taken
pursuant to this section, with a statement of the charges for the city’s
services, the amount paid for the performance of the labor, the fees of the
officers who made the service of the notice and return, and a proper

for the purpose of making the same a lien upon such lands, to be collected as
other taxes and returned to the city with the General Fund in accordance with
R.C. § 731.54.

§ 111.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to minimize and control the negative effects of amusement
arcades within the city in order to promote the health, safety and welfare of
the citizens of the city. It is not the purpose or intent of this chapter to
restrict or deny access to recreational and skilled-based amusement machines.
   (B)   Findings. The state currently allows certain games of skill while
games of chance are deemed illegal. Certain arcades identified as operating
games of skill, have generated various complaints by citizens involving thefts,
questionable pay practices, considerable sums of cash being transacted, food
management concerns, fire code and access, and other issues of compliance with
local and state laws.
   (C)   It is the specific finding that games of skill operated electronically
may easily be altered to illegal games of chance. Further, the city has a duty
to its citizens to require businesses open to the public to maintain safe
ingress and egress, to maintain adequate security where a considerable volume
of cash is transacted and to otherwise operate within the bounds of the law.
(Prior Code, § 830.01) (Ord. 2007-18, passed 7-10-2007)

machine’s offering or to activate the machine; provided that all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The machine involves a task, game, play, contest, competition or
tournament in which the player actively participates in the task, game, play,
contest, competition or tournament;
      (2)   The outcome of an individual’s play and participation is not

or tournament, that contest, competition or tournament has a defined starting
and ending date, and is open to participants in competition for scoring and

provided in said consent.
   (C)   Rights permitted. No consent granted under §
115.02 shall convey any right, title or interest in the public right-of-way,

§ 115.04 LOCATION, RELOCATION AND REMOVAL OF MICRO WIRELESS FACILITY.
   (A)   Excess capacity. To reduce excavation and congestion in the public

occupancy of utility poles, as well as to construct, whenever possible, excess
available space on utility poles for occupancy of future micro wireless
facilities in the public right-of-way. The service provider may charge a
reasonable market lease rate to other providers for occupancy of the additional
utility pole space as reimbursement.

related appurtenances in the public right-of-way shall, at its own expense,
remove the micro wireless facility or appurtenances from the public right-of-
way of the city. After the 30 days have expired, the city may remove the micro
wireless facility or appurtenances from the public right-of-way at the other
party’s expense. A micro wireless facility is unauthorized and subject to
removal in the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon revocation of the service provider’s consent to occupy or use
the public right-of-way;
      (2)   Upon abandonment of a micro wireless facility in the public right-
of-way of the city;
      (3)   If the micro wireless facility was constructed, reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained without the consent to do so, except
as otherwise provided by this chapter;
      (4)   If the micro wireless facility was constructed, reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any excavation of a public
right-of-way was performed, without prior issuance of a required construction
permit, except as otherwise provided by this chapter; or
      (5)   If the micro wireless facility was constructed, reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any excavation of a public
right-of-way was performed, at a location not permitted pursuant to the city’s
consent to occupy or use the public right-of-way or construction permit.
   (D)   Emergency removal or relocation of micro wireless facility. The city
retains the right and privilege to cut or move any facilities, or stop work on
any construction, reconstruction and privilege to cut or move any facilities,
or stop work on any construction, reconstruction, installation, operation or
excavation, located in the public right-of-way of the city, as the city may
determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any need to
protect the public health, safety or welfare.

city without 24 hours advance notice to the city, obtaining consent to occupy
or use the public right-of-way pursuant to §
115.02, if required.
   (B)   Routine maintenance and new service orders.
      (1)   A service provider need not obtain a construction permit or notify

orders that do not include the construction in, or excavation or lane
obstruction of, a public right-of-way or closing of a public street.

service provider to cause a lane obstruction in a public street for more than
two hours, the service provider shall provide the city with 48 hours advance
written notice prior to commencing the routine maintenance or new service
order, and shall submit a drawing showing the planned traffic maintenance and
indicating how the service provider will meet all requirements of ODOT’s Manual
of Traffic Control Devices or other applicable governmental regulations.
   (C)   Emergency work. In the event of the need for any unexpected repair or

required under the circumstances; provided that for emergency work that
requires excavation of a public right-of-way or lane obstruction or closing of
a public street, the service provider shall notify the city as promptly as
possible before commencing such emergency work, or as soon as possible
thereafter if advance notice is not practicable. When notice is required, the
service provider shall notify the Building Commissioner.

complicity in committing a violation of R.C. § 2903.01 or R.C. § 2903.02 if the
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4, 2023, and
applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.

§ 130.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
      CULPABILITY. Means purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in R.C. § 2901.22.
      INTOXICATION. Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting from
the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Means reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      POSSESSION. Means a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21) (Prior Code, § 606.07)
§ 130.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22) (Prior Code, § 606.02)
§ 130.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. The term does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23) (Prior Code, § 606.08)
§ 130.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in R.C.
§ 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if
he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24) (Prior Code, § 606.09)
 
§ 130.11 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      MOTOR VEHICLE. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.
(R.C. § 2923.02) (Prior Code, § 606.21)
Statutory reference:
   Conspiracy, see R.C. § 2923.01
   Solid and hazardous wastes, see R.C. Chapter 3734
§ 130.12 COMPLICITY.
   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of R.C. § 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(R.C. § 2923.03) (Prior Code, § 606.22)
Statutory reference:
   Conspiracy, see R.C. § 2923.01
§ 130.13 PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE; PROOF OF OFFENSE; AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.
   (A)   Every person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the burden of proof for all elements of
the offense is upon the prosecution. The burden of going forward with the
evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof by a preponderance
of the evidence, for an affirmative defense other than self-defense, defense of
another, or defense of the accused’s residence presented as described in
division (B)(1) of this section, is upon the accused.
   (B)   (1)   A person is allowed to act in self-defense, defense of another,
or defense of that person’s residence. If, at the trial of a person who is
accused of an offense that involved the person’s use of force against another,
there is evidence presented that tends to support that the accused person used
the force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person’s
residence, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused person did not use the force in self-defense, defense of another, or
defense of that person’s residence, as the case may be.
      (2)   Subject to division (B)(3) of this section, a person is presumed to
have acted in self-defense or defense of another when using defensive force
that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to another if
the person against whom the defensive force is used is in the process of
unlawfully and without privilege to do so entering, or has unlawfully and
without privilege to do so entered, the residence or vehicle occupied by the
person using the defensive force.
      (3)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section does
not apply if either of the following is true:
         (a)   The person against whom the defensive force is used has a right
to be in, or is a lawful resident of, the residence or vehicle.
         (b)   The person who uses the defensive force uses it while in a
residence or vehicle and the person is unlawfully, and without privilege to be,
in that residence or vehicle.
      (4)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section is a
rebuttable presumption and may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence,
provided that the prosecution’s burden of proof remains proof beyond a
reasonable doubt as described in divisions (A) and (B)(1) of this section.
   (C)   As part of its charge to the jury in a criminal case, the court shall
read the definitions of “reasonable doubt” and “proof beyond a reasonable
doubt”, contained in division (E) of this section.
   (D)   As used in this section:
      AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. An affirmative defense is either of the following:
         (a)   A defense expressly designated as affirmative;
         (b)   A defense involving an excuse or justification peculiarly within
the knowledge of the accused, on which the accused can fairly be required to
adduce supporting evidence.
      DWELLING. Means a building or conveyance of any kind that has a roof over
it and that is designed to be occupied by people lodging in the building or
conveyance at night, regardless of whether the building or conveyance is
temporary or permanent or is mobile or immobile. As used in this division, a
building or conveyance includes but is not limited to an attached porch, and a
building or conveyance with a roof over it includes but is not limited to a
tent.
      RESIDENCE. Means a dwelling in which a person resides either temporarily
or permanently or is visiting as a guest.
      VEHICLE. Means a conveyance of any kind, whether or not motorized, that
is designed to transport people or property.
   (E)   “Reasonable doubt” is present when the jurors, after they have
carefully considered and compared all the evidence, cannot say they are firmly
convinced of the truth of the charge. It is a doubt based on reasonable and
common sense. Reasonable doubt is not mere possible doubt, because everything
relating to human affairs or depending on moral evidence is open to some
possible or imaginary doubt. “Proof beyond a reasonable doubt” is proof of such
character that an ordinary person would be willing to rely and act upon it in
the most important of the person's own affairs.
(R.C. § 2901.05)
§ 130.14 BATTERED WOMAN SYNDROME.
   (A)   The municipality hereby declares that it recognizes both of the
following, in relation to the “battered woman syndrome”: that the syndrome
currently is a matter of commonly accepted scientific knowledge, and that the
subject matter and details of the syndrome are not within the general
understanding or experience of a person who is a member of the general populace
and are not within the field of common knowledge.
   (B)   If a person is charged with an offense involving the use of force
against another and the person, as a defense to the offense charged, raises the
affirmative defense of self defense, the person may introduce expert testimony
of the “battered woman syndrome” and expert testimony that the person suffered
from that syndrome as evidence to establish the requisite belief of an imminent
danger of death or great bodily harm that is necessary, as an element of the
affirmative defense, to justify the person’s use of force in question. The
introduction of any expert testimony under this division shall be in accordance
with the Ohio Rules of Evidence.
(R.C. § 2901.06)
§ 130.15 DELINQUENCY ADJUDICATIONS DEEMED CONVICTIONS.
   (A)   If a person is alleged to have committed an offense and if the person
previously has been adjudicated a delinquent child or juvenile traffic offender
for a violation of a law or ordinance, except as provided in division (B) of
this section, the adjudication as a delinquent child or as a juvenile traffic
offender is a conviction for a violation of the law for purposes of determining
the offense with which the person should be charged and, if the person is
convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense, the sentence to be imposed upon
the person relative to the conviction or guilty plea.
   (B)   A previous adjudication of a person as a delinquent child or juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of a law or ordinance is not a conviction for
a violation of the law or ordinance for purposes of determining any of the
following:
      (1)   Whether the person is a repeat violent offender, as defined in R.C.
§ 2929.01, or whether the person should be sentenced as a repeat violent
offender under R.C. § 2929.14(B)(2) and R.C. § 2941.149;
      (2)    Whether the person is a violent career criminal as defined in R.C.
§ 2923.132, whether the person has committed unlawful use of a weapon by a
violent career criminal in violation of R.C. § 2923.132 or should be sentenced
for that offense under that section, or whether the person should be sentenced
under R.C. § 2929.14(K) as a violent career criminal who had a firearm on or
about the person’s person or under the person’s control while committing a
violent felony offense and displayed or brandished the firearm, indicated that
the offender possessed a firearm, or used the firearm to facilitate the
offense.
(R.C. § 2901.08)
§ 130.16 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (A)   A person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this municipality,
any element of which takes place in this municipality;
      (2)   While in this municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this municipality and the
other jurisdiction, or, while in this municipality, the person conspires to
commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under
both the laws of this municipality and the other jurisdiction, and a
substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is undertaken in this
municipality by the person or another person involved in the conspiracy,
subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any case in which a
person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the commission of, or
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as described in this
division, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and for any resulting
offense that is committed or completed in the other jurisdiction;
      (3)   While out of this municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
municipality;
      (4)   While out of this municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction, or activity in this municipality;
      (5)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this municipality;
      (6)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another person and subsequently brings the other person into this
municipality;
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
municipality in violation of the law of this state or municipality.
   (B)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (A)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes
death, the death itself, or any other element that is set forth in the offense
in question. If any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this
municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this municipality.
   (C)   (1)   This municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
municipality for purposes of this section.
      (2)   The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,
Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe,
Scioto, and Washington counties have jurisdiction beyond the north or northwest
shore of the Ohio River extending to the opposite shore line, between the
extended boundary lines of any adjacent counties or adjacent state. Each of
those courts of common pleas has concurrent jurisdiction on the Ohio River with
any adjacent court of common pleas that borders on that river and with any
court of Kentucky or of West Virginia that borders on the Ohio River and that
has jurisdiction on the Ohio River under the law of Kentucky or the law of West
Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under federal law.
   (D)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
municipality for purposes of this section.
   (E)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this municipality for an offense committed or completed outside this
municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this municipality.
   (F)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (G)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this municipality.
   (H)   For purposes of division (A)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (I)   As used in this section, COMPUTER, COMPUTER SYSTEM, COMPUTER NETWORK,
INFORMATION SERVICE, TELECOMMUNICATION, TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEVICE,
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE, DATA and WRITING have the same meanings as in R.C.
§ 2913.01.

§ 130.17 DISPOSITION OF UNCLAIMED OR FORFEITED PROPERTY HELD BY POLICE
DEPARTMENT.
   (A)   Safekeeping of property in custody.
      (1)   (a)   Any property that has been lost, abandoned, stolen, seized
pursuant to a search warrant, or otherwise lawfully seized or forfeited and
that is in the custody of the Police Department shall be kept safely by the

another lawful purpose, and shall be disposed of pursuant to this section or
R.C. §§ 2981.12 and 2981.13.
         (b)   This section does not apply to the custody and disposal of any

provided in division (B)(1)(f) of this section;
            2.   Abandoned junk motor vehicles or other property of negligible

            3.   Property held by a department of rehabilitation and correction
institution that is unclaimed, that does not have an identified owner, that the
owner agrees to dispose of, or that is identified by the department as having

has received notice of a citizens’ reward program as provided in division (B)
(5) of this section and disposes of property under an ordinance shall pay 25%
of any moneys acquired from any sale or auction to the citizens’ reward
program.
      (2)   (a)   The Police Department shall adopt and comply with a written
internal control policy that does all of the following:
            1.   Provides for keeping detailed records as to the amount of
property acquired by the Police Department and the date property was acquired;
            2.   Provides for keeping detailed records of the disposition of
the property, which shall include but not be limited to both of the following:
               a.   The manner in which it was disposed, the date of

name of any person who received the property. The record shall not identify or
enable identification of the individual officer who seized any item of
property.
               b.   An itemized list of the specific expenditures made with
amounts that are gained from the sale of the property and that are retained by

that the policy shall not provide for or permit the identification of any
specific expenditure that is made in an ongoing investigation.
            3.   Complies with R.C. § 2981.13 if the Police Department has a
Law Enforcement Trust Fund or similar fund created under that section.
         (b)   The records kept under the internal control policy shall be open
to public inspection during the Police Department’s regular business hours. The
policy adopted under this section is a public record open for inspection under
R.C. § 149.43.
      (3)   The Police Department, with custody of property to be disposed of
under this section or R.C. §§ 2981.12 or 2981.13, shall make a reasonable
effort to locate persons entitled to possession of the property, to notify them
of when and where it may be claimed, and to return the property to them at the
earliest possible time. In the absence of evidence identifying persons entitled
to possession, it is sufficient notice to advertise in a newspaper of general
circulation in the county and to briefly describe the nature of the property in

with R.C. Chapter 119 to provide for the distribution to state or local law
enforcement agencies upon their request. If any tax imposed under R.C. Title 43
has not been paid in relation to the beer, intoxicating liquor, or alcohol, any
moneys acquired from the sale shall first be used to pay the tax. All other

Treasury. Any beer, intoxicating liquor, or alcohol that the Division
determines to be unfit for sale shall be destroyed.
         (e)   Money received by an inmate of a correctional institution from
an unauthorized source or in an unauthorized manner shall be returned to the
sender, if known, or deposited in the Inmates’ Industrial and Entertainment

subject to any security interest or lien on the mobile instrumentality.
            2.   Vehicles and vehicle parts forfeited under R.C. §§ 4549.61 to

      (2)   Unclaimed or forfeited property that is not described in division
(B)(1) of this section or division (A)(1)(b) of this section, with court
approval, may be used by the law enforcement agency in possession of it. If it

to the highest bidder for cash or disposed of in another manner that the court
considers proper.
      (3)   Except as provided in divisions (B)(1) and (B)(5) of this section
and after compliance with division (B)(4) of this section when applicable, any
moneys acquired from the sale of property disposed of pursuant to this section

of the municipality.
      (4)   If the property was in the possession of the Police Department in
relation to a delinquent child proceeding in a juvenile court, 10% of any
moneys acquired from the sale of property disposed of under this section shall
be applied to one or more community addiction services providers, as defined in
R.C. § 5119.01. A juvenile court shall not specify a services provider, except
as provided in this division, unless the services provider is in the same
county as the court or in a contiguous county. If no services provider is
located in any of those counties, the juvenile court may specify a services
provider anywhere in Ohio. The remaining 90% of the proceeds or cash shall be
applied as provided in division (B)(3) of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If the Board of County Commissioners recognizes a citizens’
reward program under R.C. § 9.92, the Board shall notify the Police Department
of the recognition by filing a copy of its resolution conferring that
recognition with the Police Department. When the Board recognizes a citizens’
reward program and the county includes a part, but not all, of the territory of
the municipality, the Board shall so notify the Police Department of the
recognition of the citizens’ reward program only if the county contains the
highest percentage of the municipality’s population.
         (b)   Upon being so notified, the Police Department shall pay 25% of
any forfeited proceeds or cash derived from each sale of property disposed of
pursuant to this section to the citizens’ reward program for use exclusively to
pay rewards. No part of the funds may be used to pay expenses associated with
the program. If a citizens’ reward program that operates in more than one
county or in another state in addition to this state receives funds under this
section, the funds shall be used to pay rewards only for tips and information
to law enforcement agencies concerning offenses committed in the county from
which the funds were received.
      (6)   Any property forfeited under R.C. Chapter 2981 not be used to pay
any fine imposed upon a person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an
underlying criminal offense or a different offense arising out of the same
facts and circumstances.

2907.22 or derived from the proceeds of the commission of a violation of R.C. §
2905.32, 2907.21, or 2907.22 and disposed of pursuant to this division (B)

of, used, or sold pursuant to division (B) of this section or R.C. § 2981.12.
If the property is to be sold under division (B) of this section or R.C. §
2981.12, the prosecutor shall cause notice of the proposed sale to be given in
accordance with law.

§ 130.18 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (A)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by R.C. §
1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the Ohio
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of §
130.99 or
133.99 of this code or R.C. §§ 2929.23 through 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under §
130.99(C) through (G). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (B)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         (a)   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         (b)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         (c)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         (d)   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability, or other factor
made the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of
the offense more serious;
         (e)   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B)(1)(b) and
(B)(1)(c) of this section;
         (f)   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         (g)   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (B)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
   (C)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
130.99(D), (E), (F), and (G). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
130.99(C) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (D)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. §§ 2743.51 through 2743.72.
(R.C. § 2929.22) (Prior Code, § 698.03)
§ 130.19 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, R.C. § 2929.14(C),
or R.C. § 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this municipality, this
state, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (B)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a state or federal correctional institution.
   (B)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of R.C. §
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06, 2903.08
or 4511.19 or a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving the operation of a
vehicle by the offender and that is served in a state correctional institution
when the trial court specifies that it is to be served consecutively. When
consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and prison terms are
imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies under this
division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms
imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony before
serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 2929.41) (Prior Code, § 698.05)
§ 130.20 APPREHENSION, DETENTION, OR ARREST OF PERSON ON BOND.
   (A)   No person, other than a law enforcement officer, shall apprehend,
detain, or arrest a principal on bond, wherever issued, unless that person
meets all of the following criteria:
      (1)   The person is any of the following:
         (a)   Qualified, licensed, and appointed as a surety bail bond agent
under R.C. §§ 3905.83 through 3905.95;
         (b)   Licensed as a surety bail bond agent by the state where the bond
was written;
         (c)   Licensed as a private investigator under R.C. Chapter 4749;
         (d)   Licensed as a private investigator by the state where the bond
was written;
         (e)   An off-duty peace officer, as defined in R.C. § 2921.51.
      (2)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining, or arresting the
principal, has entered into a written contract with the surety or with a
licensed surety bail bond agent appointed by the surety, which contract sets
forth the name of the principal who is to be apprehended, detained, or
arrested. For purposes of this division (A)(2), SURETY has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 3905.83.
      (3)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining, or arresting the
principal, has notified the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction
over the area in which such activities will be performed and has provided any
form or identification or other information requested by the law enforcement
agency.
   (B)   No person shall represent the person’s self to be a bail enforcement
agent or bounty hunter, or claim any similar title, in this municipality.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of illegal bail bond agent
practices.
      (1)   A violation of division (A) of this section is a misdemeanor of the
first degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of division (A) of this section, or any
substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (B) of this section is a misdemeanor of the
first degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of division (B) of this section, or any
substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
(R.C. § 2927.27)
 
§ 130.21 SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (C)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09) (Prior Code, § 606.30)
§ 130.99 PENALTY FOR TITLE XIII.
   (A)   Generally. Except where otherwise specifically classified within the
body of the section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section
shall be deemed a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more
than $500, imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.
(R.C. § 715.67)
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (B)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) through (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21)
     (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
130.18 or
133.99 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (E)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (C)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (C) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(5)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(5)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (C)(5)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (E) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (D) of
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (E) or (F) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in §§
130.18 and
133.99 of this code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   Except as provided in division (D)(4)(c) of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision
under R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (D)(4)(b) of
this section based on the violation.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E). Community residential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (E)
(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including
but not limited to hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious diseases. The
person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who
refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including but not limited to hepatitis A, B, and C, or another contagious
disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)
   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:
         (a)   A term of day reporting;
         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         (c)   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor
of the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or
fourth degree;
         (d)   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         (e)   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         (f)   A term of basic probation supervision;
         (g)   A term of monitored time;
         (h)   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         (i)   A curfew term;
         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (G) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (G), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (G) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (G) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1. and
(G)(1)(b)2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by
law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         (c)   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including but not limited to the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including but not limited to a per diem fee for room and
board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of repairing
property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (G) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s General Fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the
treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   (a)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (G)(4)(b)
and (G)(4)(c) of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         (b)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         (c)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (G)(5)(b)1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (G)(5)(b)2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (G)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (G)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (G) may designate the clerk of the court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         (a)   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 through 307.92.
         (b)    Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the board of county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
   (H)   Organizational penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this section, an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $3,000;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $2,000;
         (e)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $1,000;
         (f)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$2,000;
         (g)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than $1,000.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.

a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. When a
series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of violations of, attempts
to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations
of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an active duty service
member or spouse of an active duty service member, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. The value of
the property or services involved in the series of offenses for the purpose of
determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value
of all property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. §
2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more than one
victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant
to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a
single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed
against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active
duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the
property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value as
required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same

value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property
and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or more
offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2) or
(B)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (B)
(1) or (B)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (B)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (C)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (C)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (C)(1) or (C)(2) of this section, and the value of services, is
the fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section,
FAIR MARKET VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a
seller would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is
willing to buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed
as to all facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any
compulsion to act.
   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

§ 132.17 OPERATION OF RADIOS OR OTHER SOUND-PRODUCING DEVICES OR INSTRUMENTS IN
VEHICLES.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   No person operating or occupying a motor vehicle within the city
shall operate or amplify the sound produced by a radio, tape player or other
sound-producing device or instrument from within the motor vehicle so that the
sound is plainly audible at a distance of 100 feet or more from the motor
vehicle.
      (2)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to any law
enforcement motor vehicle equipped with any communication device necessary in
the performance of law enforcement duties or to any emergency vehicle equipped
with any communication device necessary in the performance of any emergency
procedures.
      (3)   The provisions of this section do not apply to the noise made by a
horn or other warning device required or permitted by state law.
   (B)   Plainly audible defined. As used in this section, PLAINLY AUDIBLE
means any sound produced by a radio, tape player or other mechanical or
electronic sound device, or instrument, from within the interior or exterior of
a motor vehicle, including sound produced by a portable sound-producing device
that can be clearly heard outside the vehicle by a person using his or her
normal hearing faculties, at a distance of 100 feet or more from the motor
vehicle.
   (C)   Enforcement. Any law enforcement officer who hears a sound that is
plainly audible as defined in division (B) of this section shall be entitled to
measure the sound according to the following standards:
      (1)   The primary means of detection shall be by means of the officer’s
ordinary auditory senses, so long as the officer’s hearing is not enhanced by
any mechanical device, such as a microphone or hearing aid;
      (2)   The officer must have a direct line of sight and hearing to the
motor vehicle producing the sound so that the officer can readily identify the
offending motor vehicle and the distance involved; and
      (3)   The officer need not determine the particular words or phrases
being produced or the name of any song or artist producing the sound. The
detection of a rhythmic bass reverberating type sound is sufficient to
constitute a plainly audible sound.
   (D)   Penalties. Whoever violates this section is guilty of making loud
noises from a motor vehicle, a minor misdemeanor. If the offender has been
previously convicted of making loud noises from a motor vehicle, a violation of
this section shall be a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.

§ 132.18 NOISE NUISANCE.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      AMBIENT NOISE LEVEL. The sound pressure level of the all-encompassing
noise associated with a given environment, being a composite of many sounds.
For the purpose of this chapter, it is the sound pressure level exceeding 90%
of the time, based upon a measurement period of not less than ten minutes and
excluding the alleged offensive noise.
      ANIMAL. Dogs, cats, cattle, sheep, horses, geese, ducks, turkeys,
chickens, or other fowl or any other animal, domestic or wild, maintained or
kept as a pet, for work or for a product.
      DECIBEL. A unit for measuring the intensity of sound; used with a sound
level meter; also known as dBA relating to sound perceptible to the human ear
when using an A weighting measure (experts agree 85 dBA will harm hearing over
time).
      EMERGENCY. When an authorized vehicle responds to a situation requiring
immediate police, fire or medical attention.
      NIGHT TIME. The hours from 9:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m. on weekdays, weekends
and holidays.
      NUISANCE. That which annoys or offends another or others, obstructs the
use of property, endangers the comfort or safety of others, essentially
interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life and property, and interferes
with the ambient sound level of a given property, or tends to depreciate the
value of the property of others, and/or violates the laws of decency.
      RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY. Single-family, duplex or multifamily dwellings,
nursing homes and similar facilities.
      SOUND LEVEL METER. An instrument used for the measurement of sound and
noise levels in a specified manner and conforming to the American National
Standard Institute’s specifications for sound level meters.
      SOUND PRESSURE LEVEL (SPL). The physical intensity of sound or acoustic
power that is measured by a sound level meter. SPL is influenced by numerous
noise descriptors. Some of those descriptors utilized by a sound level meter
are frequency range, pitch, flat or un-weighted measures, A-weighting measures,
C-weighting filters, and the like. A-weighting measures emphasize the middle
frequency components similar to the response of the human ear.
   (B)   Nuisance conditions prohibited.
      (1)   No person shall cause, produce or create within the city any loud
unreasonable sounds, so as to create offensive sounds or conditions which are a

or CD player, or other such device for playing music, musical instrument,
phonograph, loud speaker system, or other machine or device for the production
or reproduction of sound, or any other audible nuisance, which creates
unreasonably loud and disturbing noises of such a character, intensity, and
duration so as to disturb the peace, quiet, and comfort of any reasonable
person of normal sensitivity residing in the city;
         (b)   Any loud, unnecessary or unusual noise or noises by yelling,
singing, whistling, shouting, or otherwise, which annoys, disturbs, injures or

and duration as to disturb the peace, quiet, and good order of the city.
      (3)   No person shall operate or maintain any vehicular radio, stereo, CD
player, other device for playing music, or any noise-making device or noise-
amplifying or noise-producing instrument or device in any public or private
place, by which the peace and good order of the neighborhood is disturbed, or
by which persons owning or occupying property in the neighborhood are subject
to a noise nuisance.
      (4)   No person shall operate or maintain a home, or auto, or business
burglar alarm which upon activation shall continue to sound after a law

operating and producing sound level conditions which are deemed to be a
nuisance, by which the peace and good order of the neighborhood is disturbed,
is a violation of this code.
   (C) Maximum noise level recommendations.

analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion

prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused’s analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused’s attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis

present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis of the
alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further written
request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the
measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at
conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number of
unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

section or R.C. § 2925.51 or in any other manner on any substance that was the
basis of, or involved in, the offense to determine whether the substance
contained any amount of a controlled substance if the results of the tests
indicate that the substance tested contained any controlled substance. No court

APPENDIX A: TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR DEMOLITIONS
Demolition and Removal Procedures:
1.   The contractor shall remove the entire building, including all walls,
floors, ceiling and foundation supports of all kinds to the basement level. The
existing ground level shall be considered to be a straight line drawn between
the front highest present elevation and the rear lot line elevation.
2.   Unless otherwise specified, no building shall be removed from the premises
as a whole.
3.   In cases where basements exist, the contractor shall break up the basement
floor in such a manner as to permit the drainage of water. Basement walls, both
exterior and interior, shall be removed to the basement floor level or broken
up in pieces not larger than six inches in diameter and incorporated with

The contractor shall furnish the required amount of fill material for
completing and filling in of basements.
4.   All vault spaces shall be filled with material which shall consist of
sound durable crushed limestone, crushed slag, crushed gravel or slacker
aggregate. The material shall be such that it will compact to the satisfaction
of the city. The crushed aggregate shall be thoroughly compacted to a depth of
six inches to 100% of maximum dry density. The contractor shall not remove,
damage, or destroy vaults of private or public utilities.
5.   All metal storage tanks found underground are to be removed and disposed
of. All masonry structures underground are to be broken and filled with clean
earth. In the case of cisterns or cesspools, the contractor shall notify the
city of the existence of the same prior to the removal thereof, and upon
obtaining approval, shall break up such cisterns and/or cesspools and cause the
voids or cavities to be filled with clean earth.
6.   Where basements or excavations are located within five feet of the
straight line, as defined in Number 1, a fence shall be erected along the
street line and extended five feet beyond such basement or excavation.
7.   Demolition work shall be done in strict accordance with all applicable
laws, ordinances, and codes of the City of Green.
8.   In addition to other restrictions, the burning of any materials or rubble

facility. All trucks used for hauling must use tailgates and will be required
to use approved city truck routes. Any material dropped from the trucks must be
picked up. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to clean daily the
hauling route of all materials dropped from the haul trucks. The condition of
the haul route shall at all times meet the approval of the city. The contractor
will be required to maintain streets and clean daily from them any dirt and
debris falling from the hauling trucks or from tires. If streets are not kept
clean daily by the contractor the city will clean the same and deduct the cost
thereof from the deposit placed with the city.
10.   If any building or part thereof which is being razed or demolished
contains asbestos in quantities or under circumstances subjecting such asbestos
to federal and/or state asbestos removal regulations, the removal of such
asbestos shall be performed only by a person, firm or corporation certified by
the applicable federal and/or state approval authorities for such removal and
shall be performed in accordance with the methods and procedures required by
applicable federal and/or state statutes and regulations. If there is any
question or uncertainty regarding the existence of asbestos subject to federal
or state asbestos removal regulations, no permit shall be issued and no work
shall be commenced until a determination of the need for special asbestos
removal procedures has been determined by the County Health Department.
11.   The use of explosives to perform the work is prohibited.
12.   Prior to the demolition of any building, the contractor shall have a
licensed exterminator inspect and, if necessary, treat the building for insects
and rodents. A copy of the inspection report and treatment, if performed, must

Council Private Water Systems, Chapter 3701-28, effective January 1, 1981,
amended January 1, 1984, abandonment of a water well “means the complete
filling with grout of a well in order to seal the aquifer to prevent the
contamination of ground water. In the case of cisterns, abandonment includes
emptying the cistern and filling it with an inert solid material. In the case
of a spring or pond, abandonment means the disconnection of all piping from the
source to the point of discharge.”
   All water wells will be considered abandoned unless otherwise specified.
   All cisterns, springs or ponds will be considered abandoned.
   Water wells to be permanently abandoned shall be completely filled with
grout in order to seal the aquifer to prevent contamination of ground water.
   Cisterns to be permanently abandoned shall be emptied and completely filled
with an inert solid material.

(Prior Code, Ch. 1462, App. A)
RIPARIAN SETBACKS
§ 153.020 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The city has determined that the system of streams within the city
contributes to the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the
city. The purpose of this subchapter is to protect and preserve the water
quality within streams of the city and to protect residents of the city from
property loss and damage because of flooding and other impacts of the stream.
The city will implement this subchapter by controlling uses and developments
within a riparian setback that would impair the ability of the riparian area
to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of flood waters and regulating base flow;
      (2)   Stabilize the banks of streams to reduce bank erosion and the
downstream transport of sediments eroded from stream banks;
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in streams during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling and transforming pollutants already present in streams or
in runoff before they enter streams;
      (4)   Provide areas for natural meandering and lateral movement of stream
channels;
      (5)   Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain diverse
and connected riparian vegetation;
      (6)   Provide high quality stream habitats with shade and food to a wide
array of wildlife by maintaining diverse and connected riparian vegetation; and
      (7)   Benefit the city economically by minimizing encroachment on stream
channels and reducing the need for costly engineering solutions, such as dams
and riprap, to protect structures and reduce property damage and threats to the
safety of watershed residents, and by contributing to the scenic beauty and to
the environment of the city, the quality of life of the residents of the city,
and corresponding property values.
   (B)   This subchapter has been enacted to protect these services of riparian
areas by providing reasonable controls governing structures and uses in
riparian setbacks.
(Prior Code, § 1468.01) (Ord. 03-11, passed 10-28-2003)
§ 153.021 COMPLIANCE AND VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   No preliminary plan or zoning approvals shall be issued by the city
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations where applicable.
   (B)   Any person or organization who violates §
153.026 shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be
subject to punishment as provided in §
130.99, and shall be required to restore the riparian setback through a plan
approved by the County SWCD.
   (C)   The provisions of this subchapter may be enforced through civil or
criminal proceedings brought by the city or county prosecutor on behalf of the
city.
(Prior Code, § 1468.02) (Ord. 03-11, passed 10-28-2003)
§ 153.022 CONFLICTS WITH OTHER REGULATIONS AND SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   Where this subchapter imposes a greater restriction upon land than is
imposed or required by any other provision of law, regulation, contract or
deed, the provisions of this subchapter shall control.
   (B)   These regulations shall not limit or restrict the application of other
provisions of law, regulation, contract or deed, or the legal remedies
available thereunder, except as provided in division (A) of this section.
   (C)   If any clause, section or provision of these regulations is declared
invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, validity of
the remainder shall not be affected.

greater than one-half square mile (320 acres) and up to 20 square miles;
      (4)   A minimum of 50 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 0.05 square mile (32 acres) and up to one-half square mile (320
acres); and
      (5)    A minimum of 30 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
less than 0.05 square mile (32 acres).
   (D)   The following are exempt from the terms and protection of this
chapter: grassy swales, roadside ditches, drainage ditches created at the time
of a subdivision to convey storm water to another system, tile drainage systems
and stream culverts.
   (E)   The following shall apply to the riparian setback.
      (1)   Where the 100-year floodplain is wider than the riparian setback on
either or both sides of the stream, the riparian setback shall be extended to
the outer edge of the 100-year floodplain. The 100-year floodplain shall be
defined by FEMA and subject to review and approval per Ordinance 2002-02.
      (2)   (a)   Because the gradient of the riparian corridor significantly
influences impacts on the stream, the following adjustment for steep slopes
will be integrated into the riparian setback formulae for width determination:
 
Average Percent Slope Width of Setback
15% to 20%            Add 25 feet
21% to 25%            Add 50 feet
>25%                  Add 100 feet
 
         (b)   Average stream bank slope is to be calculated using methodology
outlined in The Ohio Supplement to Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
Technical Release Number 55 (TR-55) by USDA, NRCS.
      (3)   Where wetlands protected under federal or state law are identified
within the riparian setback, the riparian setback shall consist of the full
extent of the wetlands, plus the following additional setback widths:
         (a)   A 50-foot setback extending beyond the outer boundary of a
Category 3 wetlands;
         (b)   A 30-foot setback extending beyond the outer boundary of a
Category 2 wetlands; and
         (c)   No additional setback will be required adjacent to Category 1
wetlands.
      (4)   Wetlands shall be delineated by a qualified professional under
guidelines established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency and the delineation approved by the appropriate
agencies. All wetland delineations shall also include the latest version of the
Ohio Rapid Assessment Method for wetland evaluation approved at the time of
application of these regulations.
      (5)   The applicant shall be responsible for delineating the riparian
setback, including any expansions or modifications as required by divisions (B)
through (D) of this section, and identifying this setback on all subdivisions,
land development plans, and/or building permit applications. This delineation
shall be done at the time of application of the preliminary plans, or all plans
that are required, or at the time of submission of any permit applications.
This delineation shall be subject to review and approval by the County SWCD. As
the result of this review, the County SWCD may require further studies from the
applicant.
      (6)   Prior to any soil-disturbing activity, the riparian setback shall
be clearly delineated with construction fencing or other suitable material by
the applicant on site, and such delineation shall be maintained throughout
soil-disturbing activities. The delineated area shall be maintained in an
undisturbed state, unless otherwise permitted by these regulations. All fencing
shall be removed when a development project is completed.
      (7)   No approvals or permits shall be issued by the city prior to
delineation of the riparian setback in conformance with these regulations.
      (8)   Upon completion of an approved subdivision, the riparian setback
shall be permanently recorded on the plat records for the city.
(Prior Code, § 1468.05) (Ord. 03-11, passed 10-28-2003)
§ 153.025 USES PERMITTED.
   (A)   The following uses are permitted by right within the riparian setbacks
without prior approval.
      (1)   Open space uses. Open space uses that are passive in character
shall be permitted in the riparian setback, including, but not limited to,
those listed in divisions (A)(2) through (A)(4) of this section. No use
permitted under these regulations shall be construed as allowing trespass on
privately-held lands. Alteration of this natural area is strictly limited.
Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, the riparian setback shall
be preserved in its natural state.
      (2)   Recreational activity. Passive recreational uses, as permitted by
federal, state and local laws, such as hiking, nonmotorized bicycling, fishing,
hunting, picnicking, and similar uses and associated structures, including
boardwalks, pathways constructed of pervious material, picnic tables and
wildlife viewing areas.
      (3)   Removal of damaged or diseased trees. Damaged or diseased trees may
be removed. Because of the potential for felled logs and branches to damage
downstream properties and/or block ditches or otherwise exacerbate flooding,
logs and branches resulting from the removal of damaged or diseased trees that
are greater than six inches in diameter shall be anchored to the shore or
removed from the 100-year floodplain.
      (4)   Revegetation and/or reforestation. The revegetation and/or
reforestation of the riparian setback shall be allowed without approval of the
County SWCD. Species of shrubs and vines recommended for stabilizing flood-
prone areas along streams within the city are listed in the Appendix of this
chapter.
   (B)   The following uses are permitted by right within the riparian setbacks
with prior approval of the design.
      (1)   Stream bank stabilization/erosion control measures. Best management
practices (BMPs) for stream bank stabilization or erosion control may be
allowed if such practices are within permitted uses by the local, state and
federal government regulations, and are ecologically compatible and emphasize
the use of natural materials and native plant species where practical and
available. Such stream bank stabilization/erosion control practices shall only
be undertaken upon approval of a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP
or SWP3) by the County SWCD.
      (2)   Crossings. In reviewing plans for stream crossings, the city may
confer with the County SWCD, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division
of Natural Areas; the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, Division of Surface
Water; the County Engineer; the Department of Environmental Services of the
county; the County Health Department; or other technical experts as necessary.
         (a)   Limited crossings of designated streams through the riparian
setback by vehicles, storm sewers, sewer and/or water lines, and public utility
lines will be per the approval of local, county and state governing agencies
and as a part of the regular subdivision review process.
         (b)   One driveway crossing per stream per tax parcel will be allowed
for individual landowners.
         (c)   Roadway crossings for major and minor subdivisions, open space
subdivisions or any other nonsingle-family residential use shall be designed
and constructed per the city’s design standards and as approved by the Planning
and Zoning Commission. If more than two crossings per 1,000 linear feet of
stream center are required for these areas, the applicant must apply for a
variance.
         (d)   All roadway crossings shall be perpendicular to the stream flow
and shall minimize disturbance to the riparian setback and shall mitigate any
necessary disturbances.
      (3)   Placement of storm water retention or detention facilities may be
considered within the riparian setback if:
         (a)   Storm water quality treatment that is consistent with current
state standards is incorporated into the basin; or
         (b)   The storm water quality treatment basin is located at least 50
feet from the ordinary high water mark of the stream.
      (4)   Dredging may be permitted; provided the city or property owner
obtains all necessary permits that may be required, and notification and
presentation of the plan are provided to the Engineering Department for review
and approval.
(Prior Code, § 1468.06) (Ord. 03-11, passed 10-28-2003)

kind, except as permitted under these regulations.
   (E)   Modification of natural vegetation. Modification of the natural
vegetation shall be limited to conservation maintenance that the landowner
deems necessary to control noxious weeds; for such plantings as are consistent
with these regulations; for such disturbances as are approved under these
regulations; and for the passive enjoyment, access and maintenance of
landscaping or lawns existing at the time of passage of these regulations.
Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a landowner to plant or
undertake any other activities in the riparian setback; provided the landowner
allows for natural succession.
   (F)   Parking lots. There shall be no parking lots or other human-made
impervious cover, except as permitted under these regulations.
   (G)   New surface and/or subsurface sewage disposal or treatment area.
Riparian setbacks shall not be used for the disposal or treatment of sewage
except for:
      (1)   Undeveloped parcels that have received site evaluation approval

of passage of these regulations, that are not permitted under these regulations
may be continued, but shall not be expanded except as set forth in this
subchapter.
   (B)   If damaged or destroyed, these structures or uses may be repaired or
restored within two years from the date of damage/destruction or the adoption
of these regulations, whichever is later, at the property owners’ own risk.
   (C)   A residential structure or use within the riparian setback existing at
the time of passage of these regulations may be expanded subject to the
following provisions:
      (1)   The expansion conforms to existing zoning regulations;
      (2)   The expansion must not impact the stream channel or the 100-year
floodplain; and
      (3)   The expansion must not exceed an area of 15% of the total footprint
of existing structure or use that lies within the riparian setback. Expansions
exceeding 15% of the total footprint within the riparian setback must be
obtained through the variance process.
   (D)   Nonresidential structure or use expansions will be permitted only
through the variance process.
(Prior Code, § 1468.08) (Ord. 03-11, passed 10-28-2003)
§ 153.028 BOUNDARY INTERPRETATION AND APPEALS PROCEDURE.
   (A)   When an applicant disputes the boundary of the riparian setback or the
ordinary high water mark of a stream, the applicant shall submit evidence to
the Planning Department and the County SWCD that describes the boundary,
presents the applicant’s proposed boundary and presents all justification for
the proposed boundary change.
   (B)   The Planning Department and County SWCD shall evaluate all materials
submitted and shall make a written recommendation to the Planning and Zoning
Commission within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 60 days. A copy of

§ 153.029 VARIANCES WITHIN RIPARIAN SETBACK.
   (A)   Applications for a hearing before the Planning and Zoning Commission
for variances to the provisions of this subchapter shall be submitted to the
Planning Department.
   (B)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may consult with representatives
from the County SWCD; the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of
Natural Areas; the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, Division of Surface
Water; the County Engineer; the Department of Environmental Services of the
county; the County Health Department; or other technical experts as necessary
to provide the necessary data for the Planning and Zoning Commission to
consider variance requests.
   (C)   Expansions of residential structures or uses exceeding 15% of the
footprint area and expansions of all nonresidential structures or uses are
subject to the following:
      (1)   The expansion conforms to the existing zoning regulations;
      (2)   The expansion must not impact the stream channel or the 100-year
floodplain;
      (3)   The expansion of a nonresidential structure or use must not affect
upstream or downstream hydrologic conditions which could cause damage from
flooding or stream bank erosion to landowners in those areas. A hydrologic
study must be completed by nonresidential applicants only as a process of the
variance application; and
      (4)   The expansion of a nonresidential structure or use will not exceed
25% of the footprint area. The 25% expansion limit is per the portion of the
structure or use that lies within the riparian setback.
   (D)   Requests for variances for subdivisions will be considered for the
following:
      (1)   An additional stream crossing or crossings for a subdivision or
open space development which is necessary for the health, welfare and safety of
the residents of the subdivision; and
      (2)   A reduction of the setback width, not to exceed 10% of the
prescribed riparian setback width.
   (E)   No variances shall be granted for expansion of the following
structures or uses:
      (1)   Facilities which use, store, distribute or sell petroleum-based
products or any hazardous materials. Such facilities include, but are not
limited to, asphalt plants, dry cleaners, gasoline service stations and road
maintenance facilities; or
      (2)   Facilities which use, store, distribute or sell products which may
contribute higher than acceptable concentrations of dissolved or particulate
matter to storm water runoff around the facility. Such facilities include, but
are not limited to, landfills or transfer stations, junk yards, recycling
facilities, quarries and borrow pits, sand and gravel extraction operations,
and road salt storage barns.
   (F)   In reviewing whether to grant variances, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall consider the following:
      (1)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the functions of
the riparian area. This determination shall be based on sufficient technical
and scientific evidence as provided by the applicant and the agencies listed in
divisions (A) through (E) of this section;
      (2)   The soil type and natural vegetation of the parcel, as well as the
percentage of the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain; and
      (3)   The degree of hardship these regulations place on the applicant and
the availability of alternatives to the proposed activity.

policies exceeds $5,000 and is greater than or equal to 60% of all fire
insurance policy monetary limitations, unless there is compliance with the
following procedures.
      (1)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and
the insurance company or insurance companies equals or exceeds 60% of the
aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or
structure, the insurance company or companies, in accordance with R.C. § 715.26
(F), shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Director of Finance in
the aggregate amount of $2,000 for each $15,000 and each fraction of that
amount of a claim, or, if at the time of a proof of loss agreed to between the
named insured or insureds and the insurance company or companies, the named
insured or insureds have submitted a contractor’s signed estimate of the cost
of removing, repairing, or securing the building or other structure, shall
transfer from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate.

companies insuring the building or structure. Policy proceeds remaining after
the transfer to the city may be disbursed in accordance with the policy terms.
         (b)   The named insured or insureds may submit a contractor’s signed
estimate of the cost of removing, repairing, or securing the building or other
structure after the transfer, and the Finance Director, after notifying the
Fire Chief, shall return the amount of the fund in excess of the estimate to
the named insured or insureds; provided that the city has not commenced to
remove, repair, or secure the building or other structure.
      (2)   (a)   Upon receipt of proceeds by the city as authorized by this
section, the Finance Director shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be
used solely as security against the total cost of removing, repairing, or
securing the building or other structure incurred by the city pursuant to R.C.
§ 715.261.
         (b)   When transferring the fund as required in division (A)(1) of
this section, an insurance company shall provide the city with the name and
address of the named insured or insureds, whereupon the city shall contact the
named insured or insureds, certify that the proceeds have been received by the
city and notify them that the following procedures will be followed.
         (c)   The fund shall be returned by the Finance Director to the named
insured or insureds when the repairing, removing or securing of the building or
other structure has been completed, and the required proof is received by the
Fire Chief; provided that the city has not incurred any costs for such repair,
removal or securing. Such costs of the city shall be paid from the fund and, if
excess funds remain, the city shall transfer the remaining funds to the named
insured or insureds after such repair, rebuilding or removal has been
completed. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of
the city to recover any deficiency under R.C. § 715.261.
    (B)   Nothing in this section or R.C. § 3929.86(C) and (D), as adopted
herein, shall be construed to prohibit the city and the named insured or
insureds from entering into an agreement that permits the transfer of funds to
the named insured or insureds if some other reasonable disposition of the
damaged property has been negotiated.
    (C)   The Finance Director is hereby designated as the officer authorized
to carry out the duties of this section; provided that no funds so held under
this section shall be released without notification of such intent to the Fire
Chief.

(Ord. 2022-16, passed 11-22-2022)
§ 153.098 UNSAFE CONDITIONS; REPORTS.

within 24 hours after such discovery, report the existence of such dangerous
condition to the Zoning Division, who shall forthwith take such steps as may be
necessary to protect the public safety and welfare. No person who is an owner,

severity of risk caused by the dangerous building. In securing such structure,
the Zoning Division may call upon any department, division or bureau of the
city or whatever assistance may be necessary, or may, by private contract,
secure such structures. Such securing shall not abate the necessity to repair

FLOOD-PRONE AREAS
§ 154.01 ASSURANCE TO FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY.
   The city assures the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) that it will
enact as necessary, and maintain in force in those areas having flood hazards,
adequate land use and control measures with effective enforcement provisions
consistent with the criteria set forth in §
60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, being 44 C.F.R. §
60.3.
(Prior Code, § 1464.01) (Res. 94-R38, passed 5-24-1994)
§ 154.02 AUTHORITY OF DIRECTOR OF PLANNING.
   Council hereby vests the Director of Planning with the responsibility,
authority and means to:
   (A)   Assist the Administrator, at his or her request, in his or her
delineation of the limits of the area having special flood hazards;
   (B)   Provide such information as the Administrator may request concerning
present uses and occupancy of the flood plain areas;
   (C)   Cooperate with federal, state and local agencies and private firms
which undertake to study, survey, map and identify floodplain areas, and
cooperate with neighboring communities with respect to the management of
adjoining floodplain areas in order to prevent aggravation of existing hazards;
   (D)   Submit, on the anniversary date of the community’s initial
eligibility, an annual report to the Administrator on the progress made during
the past year within the community in the development and implementation of
floodplain management measures; and
   (E)   Upon occurrence, notify the Administrator in writing whenever the
boundaries of the community have been modified by annexation or whenever the
community has otherwise assumed or no longer has, the authority to adopt and
enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. So that all
flood hazard boundary maps and flood insurance rate maps will accurately
represent the community’s boundaries, the Director of Planning shall include,
within such notification, a copy of a map of the community suitable for
reproduction, clearly delineating the new corporate limits or the new area for
which the community has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.
(Prior Code, § 1464.02) (Res. 94-R38, passed 5-24-1994)
§ 154.03 CERTIFICATES OF FLOODPROOFING AND INFORMATION ON LOWEST FLOOR

(Prior Code, § 1464.04) (Res. 94-R38, passed 5-24-1994)
FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
§ 154.15 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, § 3 of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the legal
authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the health,
safety and general welfare of its citizens.
(Prior Code, § 1466.01) (Ord. 2009-8, passed 5-26-2009)
§ 154.16 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The city has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and government services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures exist in the city that are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the
flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the
purposes set forth in this subchapter, these regulations are adopted.
(Prior Code, § 1466.02) (Ord. 2009-8, passed 5-26-2009)
§ 154.17 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood-prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Me et community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Prior Code, § 1466.03) (Ord. 2009-8, passed 5-26-2009)
§ 154.18 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Prior Code, § 1466.04) (Ord. 2009-8, passed 5-26-2009)
§ 154.19 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the city as identified in §

§ 154.20 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (A)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Summit County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Summit County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective July 20, 2009;
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard;
and
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the state which has been approved by the
city as required by §
154.37(C).
   (B)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the city administrative offices.
(Prior Code, § 1466.06) (Ord. 2009-8, passed 5-26-2009)
§ 154.21 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Prior Code, § 1466.07) (Ord. 2009-8, passed 5-26-2009)
§ 154.22 INTERPRETATION.

      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (B)   Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with a state
or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over these
regulations.
(Prior Code, § 1466.08) (Ord. 2009-8, passed 5-26-2009)
§ 154.23 WARNING, DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY AND SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and
engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Flood heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. These
regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or
uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage.
These regulations shall not create liability on the part of the city, any
officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for
any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (B)   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by
the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect
the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the
part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

flood or 100-year flood.
   BASE (100-YEAR) FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The water surface elevation of the
base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and

FLOOD ELEVATION is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from one
to three feet).
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of
equipment or materials.
   ENCLOSURE BELOW THE LOWEST FLOOR. See LOWEST FLOOR. 
   EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988 (FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT). Issued by President Carter in
1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in
or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless
there is no practicable alternative.
   FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA). The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   FILL. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RISK ZONES. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   ZONE A. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   ZONES A1-30 and ZONE AE. Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   ZONE AO. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   ZONE A99. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   ZONE B and ZONE X (SHADED). Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   ZONE C and ZONE X (UNSHADED). Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on flood boundary and floodway maps) and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. The flood protection elevation, or FPE, is the
base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
FLOODWAY is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.
The FLOODWAY is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. FREEBOARD tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:

maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office; or
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by city’s historic preservation program, which program is certified by the Ohio
Historic Preservation Office.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the state, in accordance with standard
engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood elevations
and/or floodway boundaries.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective Flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories.
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to human-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
national flood insurance program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, or flood insurance studies.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The LOWEST FLOOR of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an ENCLOSURE BELOW THE
LOWEST FLOOR which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area; provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the LOWEST FLOOR.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. MANUFACTURED
HOME does not include a recreational vehicle. For the purposes of these
regulations, a MANUFACTURED HOME includes manufactured homes and mobile homes
as defined in R.C. Ch. 3781.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK. As specified in the O.A.C. 4781-12-01(K), any tract
of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are
parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any
roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as
part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the
individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the
purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked
thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). A federal program enabling property
owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection against
losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide an insurance
alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing
damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods. Participation in the
NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities and the federal
government that states if a community will adopt and enforce floodplain
management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all development in
special flood hazard areas; the federal government will make flood insurance
available within the community as a financial protection against flood loss.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the start of construction commenced
on or after the initial effective date of the city flood insurance rate map,
April 15, 1981, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   PERSON. Any individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership,
association or any other entity, including state and local governments and
agencies. An agency is further defined in R.C. § 111.15 as any governmental
entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any board, department,
division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution, state college or
university, community college district, technical college district, or state
community college. Agency does not include the general assembly, the
controlling board, the adjutant general’s department or any court.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT. A person registered to engage in the
practice of architecture under the provisions of R.C. §§ 4703.01 to 4703.19.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER. A person registered as a professional
engineer under R.C. Ch. 4733.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR. A person registered as a professional
surveyor under R.C. Ch. 4733.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA or AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The land in the
floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS are designated by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood insurance studies, flood boundary
and floodway maps, and flood hazard boundary maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30
and A99. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS may also refer to areas that are flood-
prone and designated from other federal state or local sources of data,
including, but not limited to, historical flood information reflecting high
water marks, previous flood inundation areas and flood-prone soils associated
with a watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued; provided the
actual START OF CONSTRUCTION, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations; or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally aboveground.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred substantial
damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered new construction;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a historic structure; provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.

§ 154.34 MAP MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.
   To meet national flood insurance program minimum requirements to have flood
data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to ensure that the city’s flood maps,
studies and other data identified in §
154.20 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified.
   (A)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
      (1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         (a)   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         (b)   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
         (c)   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
         (d)   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with §
154.37.
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with division (A) of this section, prepared in a format
required for a conditional letter of map revision or letter of map revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a conditional letter of
map revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
         (a)   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
         (b)   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by
more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but
no floodway.
      (4)   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map
revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to division (A)(1) of
this section.
   (B)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator may
request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does
not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such
as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the city and may be
submitted at any time.
   (C)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain Administrator
shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the city have been
modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an area, or
no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations
for a particular area. In order that the city’s flood insurance rate map
accurately represent the city boundaries, include within such notification a
copy of a map of the city suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the city has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
(Prior Code, § 1466.20) (Ord. 2009-8, passed 5-26-2009)
§ 154.35 DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard.
   (A)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state or other source.
   (B)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas that are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   When preliminary flood insurance rate maps and/or flood insurance
study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations; or
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist, or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (D)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in §§
154.38 through
154.43.
   (E)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks and the like) shall prevail.
(Prior Code, § 1466.21) (Ord. 2009-8, passed 5-26-2009)
§ 154.36 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (A)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire and the like. After such a damage event,
the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation or reconstruction.
   (B)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

         (c)   Have a minimum of two openings on different walls having a total
net area not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
and the bottom of all such openings being no higher than one foot above grade.
The openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or
devices; provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood
waters.
      (6)   Manufactured homes shall be affixed to a permanent foundation and
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of
over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
      (7)   Repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure, shall
be exempt from the development standards of this division (D).
       (8)   In AO Zones, new construction and substantial improvement shall
have adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide flood waters
around and away from the structure.

this division.
      (3)   In Zone AO areas with no elevations specified, the structure shall
have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least two feet above the
highest adjacent natural grade.
   (F)   Accessory structures. Relief to the elevation or dry floodproofing
standards may be granted for accessory structures containing no more than 600
square feet. Such structures must meet the following standards:
      (1)   They shall not be used for human habitation;
      (2)   They shall be constructed of flood resistant materials;
      (3)   They shall be constructed and placed on the lot to offer the
minimum resistance to the flow of flood waters;
      (4)   They shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation;
      (5)   Service facilities, such as electrical and heating equipment shall
be elevated or floodproofed to or above the level of the flood protection
elevation; and
      (6)   They shall meet the opening requirements of division (D)(5)(c) of
this section.
   (G)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles must meet at least one of
the following standards:
      (1)   They shall not be located on sites in special flood hazard areas
for more than 180 days;
      (2)   They must be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or

   (I)   Assurance of flood-carrying capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood-
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         (a)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         (b)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base
flood elevation may be permitted; provided all of the following are completed
by the applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in §
154.35(A);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor and the Chief Executive Officer of
any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         (a)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
         (b)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted; provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible; and
            2.   Division (I)(1)(b)1. and (I)(1)(b)3. through (I)(1)(b)5. of
this section.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the bankfull stage.
The field determination of bankfull stage shall be based on methods presented
in Ch. 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-245, Stream
Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or other
applicable publication available from a federal, state or other authoritative
source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse, the following
standards apply.
         (a)   The bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         (b)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
          (c)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
city specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         (d)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in §
154.35(A)(1)(c) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

(Prior Code, § 1466.26) (Ord. 2009-8, passed 5-26-2009)
§ 154.41 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (A)   Application for a variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application, at a minimum, shall contain the following
information: name, address and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
   (B)   Public hearing. At such hearing, the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
       (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (C)   Variances. Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant;
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws;
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages;
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and
      (6)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (D)   Other conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in division (B)(1) to (B)(11) of
this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-
half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Prior Code, § 1466.27) (Ord. 2009-8, passed 5-26-2009)
§ 154.42 PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.

intended for more than 12 consecutive months, the property owner is responsible
for repairing or totally removing all parts of the system no later than 90 days
after the end of the 12-month period.
         (b)   A wind turbine that is out-of-service for a continuous 12-month
period will be deemed to have been abandoned. The Zoning Division may issue a
notice of abandonment to the owner of a wind turbine that is deemed to have
been abandoned. The owner shall have the right to respond to the notice of
abandonment within 30 days from notice receipt date. The Zoning Division shall
withdraw the notice of abandonment and notify the owner that the notice has
been withdrawn if the owner provides information that demonstrates the wind
turbine has not been abandoned.
         (c)   If the wind turbine is determined to be abandoned, the owner of
a wind turbine shall remove the tower and all components completely at the
owner’s sole expense within three months of receipt of notice of abandonment.

      (2)   Solar panels must be installed in accordance with the
manufacturer’s design and operation standards, as well as all local, county,
state and federal guidelines.
      (3)   Freestanding solar panels are considered to be accessory uses,
subject to accessory use code and zoning and building permit requirements in
each zoning district, however they shall not be counted as contributing to the
total square footage of accessory uses/structures. Transmission and power lines
shall be placed underground.
   (C)   Outdoor furnaces.
      (1)   Not to be confused with wood-burning stoves and fireplaces, outdoor
furnaces are generally installed outside, sometimes within a small insulated
shed, some distance from the home for the primary purpose of the combustion of
solid fuel (wood or corn) to heat interior space or water.
      (2)   Outdoor furnaces are permitted accessory to residential uses in RR
and R-1 Zoning Districts, and must also comply with county, state or federal
agency guidelines. The city recommends installation by a qualified professional
and strict adherence to manufacturer’s instructions.
      (3)   Outdoor furnaces shall be located on minimum one acre lots to be
used during the established burning season, in compliance with the following.
         (a)   Outdoor furnaces installed after January 1, 2010 must be EPA
Phase II Program Qualified Models or better.
         (b)   Outdoor furnaces may be located only in the rear yard.
         (c)   Minimum setback to all property lines shall be 25 feet.
         (d)   If located within 100 feet of any residence not served by the
furnace, the stack height must be adjusted to minimize smoke encroaching onto
neighboring properties at human-occupied levels.
         (e)   Only natural wood or the manufacturer’s listed fuels may be
burned in any outdoor furnace. Burning of any and all other materials is
prohibited, including, but not limited to, plastics, naphtha, leaves, trash,
rubbish, garbage, construction materials, treated wood, yard waste, green wood,
pallets and the like.
         (f)   The maximum height for the furnace and/or enclosure shall not
exceed 15 feet, measured from the average grade at the base of the furnace to
the top, not including the stack.
         (g)   The property owner is required to obtain all required permits,
including a zoning permit for an accessory use and applicable permits through
County Department of Building Standards. (Note: the square footage of the
furnace shall not be calculated into the total square footage allowed for
accessory uses.)
         (h)   Operation of outdoor furnaces is permitted during the
established burning season, from September 15 through April 30.
(Prior Code, § 1479.04) (Ord. 2009-20, passed 8-25-2009)
§ 156.05 REMEDIES.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any property owner to fail to comply with the
terms of this chapter or create a nuisance condition for neighboring property
owners.
   (B)   If city zoning determines that a violation of the code or permit has
occurred, the property owner shall be notified of the violations in writing.
   (C)   If the alleged violation does not pose an immediate threat to the
public health or safety, the parties shall engage in good faith negotiations to
resolve the issues at hand. Such negotiations shall be conducted within 30 days
of the notice of violation.
   (D)   If the conditions pose an immediate threat to the public health or
safety, the city shall require the offending alternative energy system to be
discontinued until, through negotiations with all parties involved, a solution
or system-modification can be achieved to resolve the problem.
   (E)   If city zoning determines that the parties have not resolved the
alleged violation, the city may revoke the conditional use permit, as
applicable, and/or institute enforcement proceedings or other remedy at law to
ensure compliance with this chapter.

body fails to take action on an application within the time required, such
inaction shall be deemed a denial of the application, unless the decision-
making body agrees to an extension of the time frame that is mutually agreed
upon between the applicant and the decision-making body.

public land is to be dedicated to the public. The deed shall be considered part
of the final plat for approval and recording purposes.
            e.)   The final plat submission shall include the submission of
improvement plans for the corresponding phase of development.
         2.)   Submission of the improvement plans.
            a.)   The applicant’s engineer shall prepare improvement plans,
which shall conform to the approved preliminary plan, and include all work to
be performed. In cases where the applicant proposes to develop the subdivision
in phases, improvement plans shall be submitted for each individual phase.
            b.)   The applicant shall supply the improvement plans to the
Planning Department in a form and number established by the Department.
            c.)   If the applicant finds, in the process of preparing
improvement plans, that the approved preliminary plan is not workable and
changes in layout are required, the applicant shall inform the Planning
Department. The Planning Department may require that a revised preliminary plan
be submitted for reapproval.
      (G)   Step 7 - Planning Department review and staff report on the final
plat. Prior to the PZC meeting where the final plat is scheduled for review,
the Planning Department shall review the final plat and prepare a staff report.
      (H)   Step 8 - staff review and decision on the improvement plans.
         1.)   The Planning Department shall distribute copies of the
improvement plans to the City Engineer and, where applicable, the applicant
shall submit the improvement plans to the agencies having jurisdiction for
sanitary sewer or water, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, and any
other applicable agencies.
         2.)   The review agencies shall provide comments and recommendations
on the improvement plans to the Planning Department.
         3.)   A copy of the improvement plans shall be marked and returned to
the applicant’s engineer for corrections, if necessary. If found to be
satisfactory, the original tracing shall be submitted for approval signature by
the Planning Director, City Engineer and the agencies having jurisdiction over
sanitary sewer or water (where applicable).
         4.)   Improvements shall not be constructed until such time as the
city has accepted the final plat and performance bond, and the city and other
applicable agencies have approved the improvement plans. The applicant is
required to participate in a preconstruction meeting and file all bond
documents with the Planning Department prior to commencing construction of
improvements.
      (I)   Step 9 - review and decision on the final plat by the PZC.
         1.)   The PZC shall hold a public meeting to review and make a
recommendation on the final plat. The PZC shall take one of the following
actions:
            a.)   The PZC shall give a favorable recommendation on the final
plat before any required improvements are installed pursuant to the improvement
plans, authorizing its chairperson or any other officer of the PZC, to indicate
such approval and the date on the tracing of the final plat;
            b.)   Notwithstanding the provisions of §
157.130(13), where it appears that the requirements of §
157.130(13) will be met prior to the PZC’s next scheduled meeting, the PZC may,
with the consent of the applicant, give final approval effective upon the City
Engineer’s future approval of the improvement plans and signing of the plat.
Such final approval shall take effect as of the date of the City Engineer’s
signature;
            c.)   If the requirements of §
157.130(13) have not been met by the time of the PZC’s next scheduled meeting,
the final plat may be placed on the agenda for the next PZC meeting, at which
the PZC may reaffirm, modify or change its previous action; or
            d.)   Should the PZC deny the final plat, written notice of such
action, including reference to the regulation or regulations not complied with
by the plat, shall be mailed to the applicant and the applicant’s engineer and/
or surveyor. The action shall also be entered on the official records of the
PZC.
         2.)   The chairperson of the PZC shall certify the final plat by
signing and dating the final plat upon approval from the PZC.
         3.)   Upon making a favorable or unfavorable recommendation, with or
without conditions, the PZC shall communicate its action to City Council.
      (J)   Step 10 - review and decision on the final plat by the City
Council.
         1.)   After full compliance with this section, the Planning Department
shall request the Law Director to prepare the necessary legislation for Council
for introduction no later than the 60 days of the PZC’s recommendation.
         2.)   Council shall review and judge the final plat with access to the
files of the PZC and shall accept bonds for the guarantee of performance of
public improvements pursuant to division (9) of this section, and acceptance of
the plat.
         3.)   If approval is given, the plat and any appropriate documents
shall be signed by the President and Clerk of Council upon passage of the
acceptance resolution duly signed by the Mayor. All drawings shall be returned
to the Planning Department for distribution and filing.
   (5)   Approval criteria. In order to approve a major subdivision, the PZC
and City Council, as appropriate, shall determine the following:
      (A)   That the major subdivision complies with all applicable provisions
of this Code;
      (B)   That the major subdivision does not conflict with other
regulations, plans or policies of the city;
      (C)   That applicable review agencies have no objections that cannot be
resolved by the applicant; and
      (D)   That the major subdivision is not otherwise contrary to the
interest of the city.
   (6)   No construction until bond is accepted.
      (A)   No construction shall take place until a bond, as required by this
Code, is received and approved by the Planning and Law Departments, and
authorization to proceed is granted by the city at the time the final plat is
approved and accepted.
      (B)   A land disturbance permit may be issued if all criteria for its
issuance are approved.
      (C)   No public infrastructure may be installed.
   (7)   Effect of approvals.
      (A)   Effect of preliminary plan approval.
         1.)   An approved preliminary plan is to be used as a guide for the
preparation of improvement plans and the final plat for final approval and
recording upon fulfillment of all conditions of the preliminary plan approval
and all provisions of this Code.
         2.)   Approval of a preliminary plan shall be valid for a period of
one year at which point the PZC shall review the preliminary plan for renewal.
If the PZC does not authorize renewal, the preliminary plan shall expire.
         3.)   Upon expiration of a preliminary plan approval, no approval of a
final plat shall be given until the preliminary plan has been resubmitted and
approved pursuant to division (4) above.
   (B)   Effect of final plat approval.
         1.)   Approval of a final plat by the PZC shall not be an acceptance
by the public of the offer of dedication of any street, highway, or other
public way or open space upon the plat, until such acceptance is also endorsed
by the City Council upon the tracing of the final plat.
         2.)   The PZC’s approval shall automatically expire if the final plat
is not presented to the City Council for approval within one year of the PZC’s
preliminary plan approval.
   (8)   Estimated cost. Upon approval of the construction drawings by the City
Engineer and Planning Director, and before starting any construction work, the
developer’s engineer shall prepare and submit to the Planning Department and/or
the agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water (where
applicable), an independent estimate of costs, by item, for construction
surveying; construction of roads, storm and sanitary sewers, sanitary treatment
plants, pumping stations and water supply systems; drainage structures; erosion
control, storm water management basins, restoration of land and site clean-up;
and other related items. The total estimated cost, including labor, shall be
prepared and signed by the developer’s engineer. The City Engineer and/or the
agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water (where applicable),
may add to the developer’s estimate an amount to cover contingencies, including
inspection costs, to arrive at the total estimated cost. The approved total of
estimated costs shall be the basis for the establishment of the performance
bond amount.
   (9)   Bonding requirements.
      (A)   Performance bonds.
         1.)   Before the recording of any plat of any subdivision, the
developer shall furnish performance bonds to the Planning Director in an amount
equal to 100% of the approved total estimated cost of the improvements. The
improvements shall be covered by separate bonds according to the department
which shall guarantee completion of the required improvements, as follows.
            a.)   City of Green.
               i.)   Paving;
               ii.)   Storm sewer; and
               iii.)   Miscellaneous (i.e., monuments, street signs,
restoration of land, site clean-up and the like).
            b.)   Agencies having jurisdiction.
               i.)   Water; and
               ii.)   Sanitary sewer.
         2.)   The performance bond will remain in effect until released by the
Mayor through executive order. In lieu of a surety bond, the developer may
deposit a fund equal to 100% of the performance bond in an escrow account with
a bank and approved by the city. The developer and the bank shall inform the
city, in writing, that said money is secured and deposited in the bank for the
improvements and shall be in a form dictated by the city. Performance bonds
shall not be released without approval of the city.
         3.)   The developer’s engineer shall verify all invoices and
statements of expenditures and submit them to the Planning Director and/or the
agencies having jurisdiction for sanitary sewer or water (where applicable),
for review and approval.
         4.)   The withdrawal of funds from the escrow account shall not exceed
90% of the total estimated costs until the performance bond is released and the
maintenance bond is in effect. The Mayor may, upon recommendation of the City
Engineer and Planning Director, elect to release a portion of the performance
bond based on the amount of construction work performed. Upon full release of
the performance bond, the city may accept the maintenance bond prior to the
completion of the project; provided the public improvements are 90% complete
and the maintenance bond includes work to be performed at a value of 100% of
the cost of items yet to be completed.
         5.)   If the developer fails to proceed with the project within 18
months of the date the performance bonds are filed, and the Planning Director
and/or agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water (where
applicable), deems it necessary to notify the Mayor that the developer has
failed in his or her duty to complete the project, the Mayor or his or her
designee shall notify the developer and the bank, in writing, of such failure
and of their intention to vacate the subdivision or complete the project, using
proceeds from the bond.
      (B)   Maintenance bond or bonds. Before the City Engineer and/or the
agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water (where applicable),
will recommend the acceptance of the subdivision roads or release any
performance bond, the developer shall provide a maintenance bond or cash to the
Planning Director, which shall be divided and administered as follows:
         1.)   Bonds as required by the agency having jurisdiction for water or
sanitary sewer; and
         2.)   Ten percent of the total estimated cost of all other
improvements divided into separate bonds as follows.
            a.)   City of Green.
               i.)   Paving;
               ii.)   Storm sewer; and
               iii.)   Miscellaneous (i.e., monuments, street signs,
restoration of land and site clean-up and the like).
            b.)   Agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water.
               i.)   Water; and
               ii.)   Sanitary sewer.
         3.)   The Planning Director after consultation with the City Engineer
and/or the agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water, as
applicable, may increase the required maintenance bond above the specified
amounts if, in his or her opinion, unusual topographic, subsoil or other
construction limitations warrant such action. However, in such situations, the
City Engineer or the agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water,
as applicable, shall furnish written explanations of their action to the Mayor
and City Council. No action shall be taken by the city regarding bonding with
the agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water. These
maintenance bonds shall guarantee that the developer will maintain the road and
related improvements for a minimum of two years and that the developer will
restore the road and related improvements, if determined to be necessary by the
City Engineer and/or the agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or
water (where applicable). If the developer fails to perform the maintenance and
restoration items, the Mayor will authorize the City Engineer and/or the County
Executive to authorize the agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or
water (where applicable), to have the work performed. The cost of this work
shall be deducted from the money on deposit as the maintenance bond for that
work. The developer shall be held liable for any expenditures over and above
the maintenance bonds. After all maintenance and restoration work has been
completed to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, Service Director, Planning
Director and/or the agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water
(where applicable), the city’s and the county’s Chief Executive shall release
the maintenance bonds or those portions remaining to the developer,
respectively. It is the responsibility of the developer to request inspection
for bond release. The bonds shall remain in effect until formally released by
the Mayor through an executive order, as applicable.
         4.)   Upon release of the performance bond and acceptance of the
maintenance bond, the city shall provide for the removal of snow and ice
provided all roadway improvements are complete.
   (10)   Land disturbance permit required. A land disturbance permit, issued
in accordance with §
157.053, shall be required prior to commencement of clearing and grading
activities on the site. Clearing and grading activities shall not begin until
the applicant has held a preconstruction meeting with either the city, or, if
required, the County Soil and Water Conservation District, and a plan for
clearing and grading is approved. Such permit shall be based on a clearing and
grading plan prepared and approved as part of the major subdivision process.
   (11)   Recording.
      (A)   After all required approvals are secured, the final plat shall be
submitted by the Planning Department for final recording with the County Fiscal
Office.
      (B)   No plat of any subdivision shall be recorded in the office of the
County Fiscal Officer, or have any validity, until it has been approved and
processed in the manner prescribed in this section.
      (C)   In the event that any such unapproved plat is recorded, it shall be
considered invalid.
      (D)   All costs for recording of the plat shall be borne by the owner
and/or developer.
   (12)   Requirements for the start of construction of public improvements.
The applicant must comply with the following requirements in order to begin
construction on the public improvements pursuant to the approved improvement
plan.
      (A)   The following items must have been approved prior to the
commencement of construction:
         1.)   The improvement plans for the subdivision;
         2.)   The construction schedule, showing the starting and completion
dates for each phase of the construction work, and a date for the completion of
the entire subdivision; and
         3.)   Any bonds required for the project must be filed with the
Planning Department.
      (B)   The contractor must have all necessary permits required for the
project prior to the start of construction.
      (C)   A preconstruction meeting will be held, at which time the owner,
the developer and/or his or her representative, the design engineer, the
contractor, the City Engineer, the Planning Director, any other interested city
officials and other agencies, as required, will attend prior to the
commencement of any project. At this time, the project will be discussed in
regard to the procedure, construction methods, plans, materials, inspections,
storm water management, erosion control and the like.
   (13)   Amendments.
      (A)   No changes, erasures, modifications or revisions shall be made to
any improvement plans of a subdivision after approval has been given by the
city and an endorsement is made in writing thereon, unless the improvement plan
is first resubmitted and the changes approved by the city and/or the agencies
having jurisdiction over wastewater or water (where applicable).
      (B)   No changes, erasures, modifications or revisions shall be made to
any final plat of a subdivision after approval has been given by the PZC and
City Council, and an endorsement is made in writing on a final plat, unless the
final plat is first resubmitted and the changes approved by the PZC and City
Council.
      (C)   If it becomes necessary to modify the improvements as approved due
to unforeseen circumstances, the developer shall inform the Planning Director
who shall consult with the City Engineer and the agencies having jurisdiction
over wastewater or water (where applicable), in writing, of the conditions
requiring the modifications. Written authorization from the appropriate review
agency to make the required modification must be received before proceeding
with the construction of the improvement.
   (14)   Plan checking and field inspection fees. The applicant shall pay or
reimburse the city and/or the agencies having jurisdiction over wastewater or
water (where applicable), the total cost of plan review and field inspection of
the improvements.
      (A)   The review and inspection fee shall be determined by the city and
the agencies having jurisdiction over wastewater or water (where applicable).
      (B)   The inspector’s salary shall be paid at the rate discussed at the
preconstruction meeting.
      (C)   The rate per hour will be the inspector’s regular rate per hour as
paid by the city and/or the agencies having jurisdiction over wastewater or
water (where applicable), plus appropriate fringe benefits and an overhead
percentage.
      (D)   The applicant is held responsible for all city plan review and
inspection fees which will be payable upon invoice.
      (E)   Failure to pay fees shall result in the city not issuing permits
until all fees are paid in full.
      (F)   The performance bond posted by the applicant guarantees the payment
of all inspection fees and no bonds will be released until all inspection fees
have been paid in full.
   (15)   Final drawings. At the completion of the construction, and before
acceptance, the developer’s engineer shall update the original tracings as
directed by the City Engineer and the agencies having jurisdiction over
wastewater or water (where applicable), showing the locations, sizes and
elevations of all improvements as constructed. A legible Mylar reproduction
shall be furnished to the agencies having jurisdiction over wastewater or water
(where applicable). The original tracings shall remain with the Planning
Department. An electronic version shall be provided in a program compatible
with the city’s computer system.
   (16)   Variance of land development standards.
      (A)   The PZC may consider and grant variances from the standards
identified in §§
157.130 through
157.133, as they relate to subdivisions, where unusual or exceptional factors
or conditions require such modification; provided that the PZC shall:
         1.)   Determine that the size, shape, location or surroundings of the
property are unusual and that unusual topographical or physical conditions or
other conditions inherent in the land exist;
         2.)   Determine that a strict compliance with the provision would
create an extraordinary and unnecessary hardship in the face of the exceptional
conditions;
         3.)   Permit any variance of a provision only to the extent necessary
to equitably remove the hardship so that substantial justice is done;
         4.)   Determine that any modification granted will not be detrimental
to the public interest nor in conflict with the spirit, intent and purpose of
these regulations;
         5.)   Require such other conditions to be met by the proposed plat as
the PZC may find necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Code, when
modified; and
         6.)   Determine that a strict compliance with the provision would
deprive the property of privileges enjoyed by similar properties in the
vicinity.
      (B)   In making its determinations, the PZC may also consider:
         1.)   Whether the property will yield a reasonable return or whether
there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
         2.)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood will be
altered or whether adjoining properties would be adversely affected as a result
of the variance; and
         3.)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services.
      (C)   Cul-de-sacs shall be discouraged if future roadway connections can
be made. The PZC shall have the right to deny cul-de-sacs based on development
design versus service-related functions. Where a subdivision includes a cul-de-
sac that requires a variance because the cul-de-sac is in excess of the maximum
permitted length, the PZC may also consider the number and size of sublot
served by the cul-de-sac, and the availability of central water service, to
determine if the variance will permit appropriate development of the land
without unduly affecting the public safety. The PZC may also consider the
opinions of local city officials.
      (D)   If the proposed variance involves the creation of a sublot whose
depth exceeds four and one-half times its width, the PZC may also consider the
pattern of existing platting for similarly zoned land adjacent to the property
and within 500 feet of the proposed site.
      (E)   The City Council may support variances affecting required
improvements upon approval by the PZC. Such recommendations shall be based on
the findings listed in this section.
   (17)   Appeals. Whenever an applicant presenting a preliminary plan for a
major subdivision to the PZC has been rendered a decision from the PZC which is
adverse to the request of the applicant, the aggrieved applicant may make an
appeal to Council.
      (A)   The appeal shall be submitted to Council within 30 days following
the PZC decision and a copy of said appeal shall be filed with the PZC and the
Planning Department.
      (B)   The appeal shall state, in full, the reasons it is being filed and
the facts surrounding the same. Any facts and/or information not previously
available to the PZC, the inclusion of which at the time of the appeal would
operate to substantially alter the facts and information submitted to the PZC
prior to its original decision concerning the matter, shall be cause for
resubmission of such matter to the PZC, together with new facts and
information, for its reconsideration.
      (C)   Council shall, upon receipt of an appeal, request a statement from
the PZC setting out the reasons for the decision being appealed, so as to
properly advise Council as to the considerations and regulations upon which the
original decision was based.
      (D)   The Clerk of Council shall notify the PZC, applicant, owner of the
subject property, and contiguous property owners of the time and place of
Council’s consideration of any such appeal. All parties shall be heard and
final judgment rendered by a two-thirds vote of Council. Such decision shall be
in writing, with the original being sent to the appellant and a copy to the
PZC.
(Prior Code, § 1224.06) (Ord. 2009-21, passed 10-27-2009; Ord. 2018-13, passed
8-28-2018)
§ 157.051 SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a process for the
review and approval of site plans and building designs by the DRB, PZC and city
officials. These regulations are established in the interest of encouraging
quality development, establishing compatibility of designs, establishing a
sense of place and identity for the community, and for the special design
districts within the community, to ensure proper design of sites for the
effective use of land, and to promote high standards in the layout, design,
landscaping and construction of development. Site plan review is intended to
control site and building design only to the extent necessary to promote these
objectives, while allowing flexibility and creativity in the design of
individual sites.
   (2)   Applicability. No use or construction for which a site plan review is
required shall be established or commenced and no permit or certificate shall
be issued until a site plan application has been approved by the PZC.
      (A)   In all residential districts and planned development districts that
allow residential uses, any new construction, substantial renovation, or
expansion of a building or site improvements, or establishment of a new use
for:
         1.)   Two-family dwellings;
         2.)   Multi-family dwellings;
         3.)   Conditional uses;
         4.)   Agricultural building, roadside stand, private stable or
building for housing domestic animals;
         5.)   Commercial uses, as permitted in planned developments; and
         6.)   Recreational facilities, as permitted in planned developments.
      (B)   In all commercial or industrial districts, any new construction,
substantial renovation or expansion of a building or site improvements, or
establishment of a new use as defined in division (2)(C) below.
      (C)   As used in this section, “new construction, substantial renovation,
expansion of a building or site improvements, or establishment of a new use”
shall include the following:
         1.)   New construction, expansion in floor area, change in location on
a lot, or significant reconstruction or alteration of an exterior wall, roof,
or other exterior part of a main structure or of an accessory structure, not
including repair or replacement of a structure or part of a structure in a
manner conforming to an approved site development plan;
         2.)   New construction, alteration, or expansion of any freestanding
sign or any attached sign which is greater than 20 square feet, and replacement
of sign panels in an existing nonconforming sign;
         3.)   Construction of a new curb cut, parking area, drive, loading
area or related improvement;
         4.)   Alterations to site improvements (including, but not limited to,
fences, walls, and landscaping enclosing loading and storage areas) which are
designed to buffer or protect abutting properties from impacts, except that, if
no other changes to the site require site plan review by the Planning and
Zoning Commission, the Planning Director may approve the design of such
improvements without site plan review by the Commission or may require that
such improvements be reviewed by the Commission; and
         5.)   A change in the use of an existing building or lot, where:
            a.)   A dwelling is replaced by any other use or where a dwelling
use replaces any other use;
            b.)   The number of dwelling units is increased in a multi-family
dwelling or on a lot having multi-family use;
            c.)   A commercial use is replaced by an industrial or
institutional use;
            d.)   An industrial use is replaced by a commercial or
institutional use;
            e.)   An institutional use is replaced by a commercial or
industrial use;
            f.)   A use other than a dwelling is expanded into existing,
unfinished floor area; and
            g.)   The Planning Director determines that a proposed new use will
create new impact on abutting properties, will generate additional traffic,
will require additional parking or altered curb cuts and drives, or will have
other effects which justify review of the suitability of the site and
improvements to support the proposed new use.
   (3)   Initiation. Pursuant to §
157.047(1), any person having authority to file applications may initiate an
application for a site plan review.
   (4)   Procedure. The review procedure for a site plan review shall be as
follows.

plan. The DRB shall communicate its action to the PZC.
      (E)   Step 5 - Planning Department review and staff report.
         1.)   The Planning Department shall distribute the final site plan to
appropriate administrative departments for review and comment. Such departments
shall return written comments to the Planning Department a minimum of seven
days prior to the PZC meeting at which the site plan will be reviewed.
         2.)   The Planning Department shall review the final site plan and
make a recommendation to the PZC to approve, approve with conditions or deny
the final site plan. The Planning Department may also recommend the continuance
of the matter to allow for further review.
      (F)   Step 6 - PZC review and decision.
         1.)   The PZC shall hold a public meeting within 30 days of the filing
of the final site plan where a recommendation from the DRB is not required or
45 days of the filing of the final site plan when a recommendation from the DRB
is required.
         2.)   Within 60 days of the public meeting, the PZC shall either
approve, approve with conditions, deny the approval or table the review of the
final site plan.
         3.)   If the site plan is denied, the PZC shall make a finding, in
writing, justifying the denial of the plan and provide a copy of the findings
to the applicant.
         4.)   The PZC may attach conditions to the approval of a site plan as

provide a copy of the findings to the applicant.
         4.)   In granting approval, the PZC may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformance with the intent and purposes of this
Code for the protection of nearby property and the public health, safety and
general welfare. The PZC shall authorize the Planning Department to issue the
conditional use permit with notation of conditions thereon or attached thereto.
   (4)   Approval criteria. In order to approve a conditional use, the PZC
shall use the following review criteria:
      (A)   The use is in fact a conditional use as allowed in the applicable
zoning district;
      (B)   A conditional use, except as specifically otherwise provided in
this chapter or in the applicable zoning district regulations, shall conform to
such district regulations and to other substantive requirements of this Code,
and shall also satisfy the conditions, standards and requirements of this
chapter;
      (C)   The use will be harmonious with, and in accordance with, the
purpose of this Code and the goals of the land use plan;
      (D)   The use will conform to the general character of the neighborhood

including any use specific provisions established in §§
157.085 through
157.089;
      (F)   If the use is permitted, the public health, safety and general
welfare of the neighborhood in which it will be located, will be secure;
      (G)   The use will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so
as to be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity, and will not change the essential character
of the same area;
      (H)   The use will be served adequately by essential public facilities
and services, such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal, water and sewers, and schools, or the persons or
agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed use will be able to
provide adequately any such service;
      (I)   The use will not create excessive additional requirements, at
public cost, for public facilities and services, and will not be detrimental to
the economic welfare of the community;
      (J)   The use will not be detrimental to property in the immediate
vicinity or to the community as a whole;
      (K)   The use will have vehicular approaches to the property designed so
as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
thoroughfares; and
      (L)   The use will not result in the destruction, loss or damage of a
natural or scenic feature of importance or a locally or nationally designated
historic landmark.
   (5)   Effect of a conditional use permit.
      (A)   Approvals granted under a conditional use permit shall run with the
land and shall not be affected by a change in ownership.
      (B)   The breach by the applicant of any condition, safeguard, or
requirement expressed or referred to on the conditional use permit shall render
the permit void and shall constitute a violation of this Code.
   (6)   Subsequent development. Development authorized by a conditional use
permit shall not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other
approvals required by this Code or any other applicable provisions of the city.
The approval of a conditional use permit shall not ensure that the development
approved as a conditional use shall receive subsequent approval for other
applications for development approval, unless the relevant and applicable
portions of this Code or other applicable provisions are met.
   (7)   Time limit.
      (A)   A conditional use permit shall be valid for a period of 90 days
from the date of approval. The conditional use permit shall become invalid
after the 90-day time limit, unless the applicant receives approval of a zoning
permit or is granted an extension within such time period.
      (B)   Upon written request, one extension of 30 days may be granted by
the Planning Director if the applicant can show good cause.
   (8)   Amendment. A conditional use permit may be amended, extended or
modified only in accordance with the procedures and standards established for
its original approval. A request for a change in the conditions of approval of
a conditional use permit shall be considered an amendment and subject to the
full review procedure set forth in this section.

report based upon his or her determination that the conditions of the soils are
unknown or unclear to the extent that additional information is required to
protect against erosion. This report shall contain all the information listed
below:
         1.)   Data regarding the nature and erodibility of existing soils;
         2.)   If applicable, data regarding the nature and erodibility of the
soil to be placed on the site;
         3.)   Conclusions and recommendations for grading procedures; and
         4.)   Conclusions and recommended designs for interim soil
stabilization devices and measures for permanent soil stabilization after
construction is completed.
   (7)   Compliance with local, state and federal regulations. All submittals
are required to show proof of compliance with all state and federal
regulations. Approvals issued in accordance with this chapter do not relieve
the applicant of responsibility for obtaining all other necessary permits and/
or approvals from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other
federal, state, and/or county agencies. If requirements vary, the most
restrictive requirement shall prevail. These permits may include, but are not
limited to, those listed below.
      (A)   Ohio EPA NPDES permits authorizing storm water discharges
associated with construction activity or the most current version thereof.
Proof of compliance with these requirements shall be the applicant’s notice of

copy of the Planning Department approval letter and/or zoning permit. Riparian
setbacks must be shown on the SWP3.
   (8)   Performance standards.
      (A)   The SWP3 must contain a description and location of all appropriate
BMPs for each construction operation. Prior to the start of grading and within
seven days from the start of grubbing, the applicant must implement such
controls. The SWP3 must clearly describe for each major construction activity
the appropriate control measures; the general sequence during the construction
process under which the measures will be implemented; and the person(s)
responsible for implementation. The SWP3 shall be consistent with the current
Ohio EPA NPDES construction permit. No project subject to this chapter shall
commence without a SWP3 approved by the County SWCD. No project subject to this
chapter shall commence without a preconstruction meeting being held with the
city and/or the County SWCD. It will be the applicant’s responsibility to
contact the city and/or the County SWCD.
      (B)   The applicant shall inform all contractors and subcontractors not
otherwise defined as OPERATORS as defined in the Ohio EPA’s NPDES permit, who
will be involved in the implementation of the SWP3 of the terms and conditions
of the SWP3. The applicant shall maintain a written document containing the
signatures of all contractors and subcontractors involved in the implementation
of the SWP3 as proof acknowledging that they have reviewed and understand the
conditions and responsibilities of the SWP3. The written document shall be
created and signatures shall be obtained prior to commencement of work on the
construction site. A copy shall be provided to the city and the County SWCD
prior to commencing with the project.
      (C)   A SWP3 must include BMPs to minimize erosion and off-site
sedimentation. The controls shall include the following minimum components.
         1.)   During active construction.
            a.)   Nonstructural preservation measures. The applicant must make
use of practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas,
preserving existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at
any one time, and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective
clearing or grubbing practices. The requirements of §
157.142 shall be followed for stream and wetland protection in addition to
state and federal regulations.
            b.)   Erosion control practices. The applicant must make use of
erosion controls that are capable of providing cover over 70% of disturbed
soils. A description of control practices designed to restabilize disturbed
areas after grading or construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3
must provide specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the
site and provide guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed
for any time of the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding,
permanent seeding, mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer
strips, phasing of construction operations, the use of construction entrances
and the use of alternative ground cover.
            c.)   Runoff control practices. The applicant must make use of
measures that control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent
erosion. Such practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains,
diversions to direct flow away from exposed soils and protective grading
practices. These practices shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and
steep slopes where practicable.
            d.)   Sediment control practices. The applicant must install
structural practices that shall store runoff, allowing sediments to settle and/
or divert flows away from exposed soils or otherwise limit runoff from exposed
areas. Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap sediment
from a site remaining disturbed for more than seven days. Such practices may
include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet
protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to a
sediment settling pond. All sediment control practices must be capable of
ponding or filtering runoff in order to be considered functional. Earth
diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a sediment control
practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling pond.
            e.)   Nonsediment pollutant controls. No solid or liquid waste,
including building materials and concrete wash out water shall be discharged in
storm water runoff. The applicant must implement site best management practices
to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials or other debris from entering
water resources or wetlands.
            f.)   Compliance with other requirements. The SWP3 shall be
consistent with applicable state and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer or
septic system regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by
open burning, and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils
located within the development area.
            g.)   Trench and ground water control. There shall be no sediment-
laden or turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from
dewatering activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must
pass through a sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment
control device, prior to being discharged from the construction site.
Alternatively, sediment may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering
into a sump pit, filter bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering
which does not contain sediment or other pollutants is not required to be
treated prior to discharge. However, care must be taken when discharging ground
water to ensure that it does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over
disturbed soils or other pollutant sources.
            h.)   Applicant inspections. An initial inspection of all erosion
and sediment control practices shall be conducted by a qualified individual to
certify that the installations comply with the approved SWP3. All controls on
the site shall be inspected by the applicant’s agent at least once every seven
calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half
inch of rain per 24-hour period. The applicant shall assign a qualified
individual to conduct these inspections to ensure that the control practices
are functional and to evaluate whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether
additional control measures are required. Internal inspections and
documentation of corrective actions taken must be made available upon request.
            i.)   Maintenance. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize
maintenance requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and
repaired as needed to ensure continued performance of their intended function
until final stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in
a functional condition until all upslope areas they control reach final
stabilization. The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by the city and/or the County SWCD.
            j.)   Final stabilization. All soil disturbing activities are
complete and a uniform perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70%
coverage for the area has been established on all unpaved areas and areas not
covered by permanent structures. In addition, all temporary erosion and
sediment control practices have been removed and disposed of in an acceptable
manner.
         2.)   Post construction water quality practices.
            a.)   Nonstructural water quality practices. Nonstructural post
construction best management practices include preservation, planning or
procedures that direct development away from water resources or limit creation
of impervious surfaces. Practices, such as conservation easements, riparian and
wetland setbacks, and conservation subdivision design are all nonstructural
controls.
               i.)   All nonstructural water quality practices must be
protected from disturbance through the construction phase of the project.
               ii.)   All nonstructural water quality practices must be
protected in perpetuity through the use of appropriate legal tools. All
easement or conservation areas must appear on the final plat and be disclosed
to potential buyers.
            b.)   Structural water quality practices. Structural post
construction best management practices are permanent features constructed to
provide treatment of storm water runoff either through storage, filtration or
infiltration.
               i.)   All structural water quality practices must be established
prior to the completion of the project. Structural water quality practices
should be made functional once the disturbed areas on site are stabilized. If
detention/retention facilities were used for sediment control during
development, sediments must be removed prior to the basin being used for post
construction storm water quality.
               ii.)   All structural water quality practices must be designed
to treat water quality volume using the design criteria found in the ODNR
Rainwater & Land Development Manual or as otherwise approved by the City
Engineer.
               iii.)   The post construction water quality practice must be
maintained in perpetuity by those parties identified in the SWP3 or the storm
water management maintenance agreement.
   (9)   Abbreviated Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan.
      (A)   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources and
wetland, the applicant shall submit an Abbreviated SWP3 in accordance with the
requirements of this regulation.
      (B)   The Abbreviated SWP3 shall include a minimum of the following BMPs.
The city may require other BMPs as site conditions warrant.
         1.)   Construction entrances. Construction entrances shall be built
and shall serve as the only permitted points of ingress and egress to the
development area. These entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of
aggregate stone or recycled concrete or cement sized greater than two inches in
diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and constructed in conformance with
specifications in the most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development
Manual.
         2.)   Sediment control. Silt fences shall be installed along the
perimeter of the lot’s down slope side(s) to trap sediment. Silt socks may be
used where appropriate.
         3.)   Concrete truck wash out. The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin or other public facility or natural resource is prohibited.
A designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
         4.)   Street sweeping. Streets directly adjacent to construction
entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned
daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on
these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall be cleaned weekly.
         5.)   Stabilization. Any disturbed area that will be dormant for more
than 21 days, erosion controls shall be applied within seven days of the most
recent disturbance. Any disturbed area that will be idle over winter, erosion
controls shall be applied prior to November 1.
         6.)   Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such
as boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. Straw or hay bales are not acceptable
forms of inlet protection.

      (B)   When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement or
installation of erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures
shall be followed.
         1.)   When practices require repair or maintenance. If an inspection
reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten days of the inspection.
         2.)   When practices fail to provide their intended function. If an
inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its intended
function as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control
practice is required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice
must be installed within ten days of the inspection.
         3.)   When practices depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an
inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection reveals
that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a
statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
      (C)   The Planning Department shall issue violation notices, if
necessary, as determined through the inspection process. Violations shall be

(Prior Code, § 1224.09) (Ord. 2009-21, passed 10-27-2009; Ord. 2011-07, passed
8-23-2011; Ord. 2012-24, passed 11-13-2012)
§ 157.054 VARIANCE.
   (1)   Purpose. A variance from the requirements of this Code may be granted
by the BZA, or in limited cases by the PZC, where the applicable board
determines that such a variance will not be contrary to the public intent and
where due to special conditions and practical difficulties with strict
application of this Code may exist.
   (2)   Initiation. Pursuant to §
157.047(1), any person having authority to file applications may initiate an
application for a variance.
   (3)   Procedure.
      (A)   Step 1 - application for a variance. An application for a variance
shall comply with the provisions of §
157.047.
      (B)   Step 2 - variance application review.
         1.)   The Zoning Division shall process the variance request upon its
denial of a zoning permit.
         2.)   The Planning Department (variances requested during the
subdivision process or as part of a floodplain permit) shall review the
variance request and make a recommendation to the PZC to approve, approve with
conditions or deny the request. The Planning Department may also recommend the
continuance of the matter to allow for further review.
      (C)   Step 3 - BZA or PZC hearing and decision on a variance.
         1.)   The BZA or the PZC shall hold a public hearing within 45 days of
the filing of the variance application; provided adequate notification is
provided pursuant to §
157.047(7).
         2.)   Within 45 days of the public hearing, the BZA or PZC shall
either approve, approve with conditions or deny the request for a variance.
         3.)   The BZA or PZC shall further make a finding, in writing, that
the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting or denial of the
variance.
         4.)   The BZA or PZC may amend the variance application, with approval
from the applicant, as part of the motion. However, such amendment shall not
create a larger nonconformity or larger variance published as part of the
notification requirements.
         5.)   In approving a variance, the BZA or PZC may further prescribe
any conditions and safeguards that it deems necessary to ensure that the
objectives of the provisions to which the variance applies will be met and
completed. Any violation of such conditions and safeguards, when they have been
made a part of the terms under which the variance has been granted, shall be
deemed a punishable violation under this Code.
   (4)   Basis for granting a variance. In order to grant a variance, the BZA
or PZC shall use the following review criteria:
      (A)   1.)   The BZA or PZC shall not grant a variance, as authorized in
this Code, unless it can determine that there are circumstances, conditions and
practical difficulties encountered by the applicant in complying with the
provisions of this Code. This evaluation shall include, but is not limited to,
the following criteria:
            a.)   Whether the property will yield a reasonable return without
the variance or whether there can beneficial use of the property;
            b.)   Whether the variance is substantial;
            c.)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
            d.)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services;
            e.)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with
knowledge of the zoning restrictions;
            f.)   Whether the problem can feasibly be addressed through some
method other than variance (e.g., zone change); and
            g.)   Whether the variance preserves the spirit and the intent
behind the purpose of this Code and whether substantial justice would be done
by granting the variance.
         2.)   No single factor listed above shall control, and not all factors
shall be applicable in each case. Each case shall be determined on its own
facts.
      (B)   To obtain a variance, the applicant must show practical difficulty,
by demonstrating:
         1.)   Whether strict compliance with area, setbacks, frontage, height,
bulk or density would unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property
for a permitted purpose, or would render conformity unnecessarily burdensome;
         2.)   Whether a variance would do substantial justice to the
applicant, as well as to other property owners in the district, or whether a
lesser relaxation would give substantial relief and be more consistent with
justice to others;
         3.)   Whether the plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances
of the property; and
         4.)   Whether the problem is self-created.
      (C)   Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of convenience or
profit.
      (D)   The BZA shall not consider or grant a use variance when the use is
otherwise prohibited in the zoning district in which the property is located.
In such cases, the applicant may submit a request for a zoning map amendment
pursuant to §
157.048 in order to accommodate the proposed use.
      (E)   The fact that a structure, use or lot does not conform to this Code
prior to the consideration of a variance application may not be used as a basis
for the granting of a variance.
   (5)   Effect of a variance.
      (A)   The issuance of a variance shall authorize only the particular
variation that is approved in the variance.
      (B)   A variance, including any conditions, shall run with the land and
shall not be affected by a change in ownership.
   (6)   Subsequent development. Development authorized by the variance shall
not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other approvals required
by this Code or any other applicable provisions of the city. A variance shall
not ensure that the development with an approved variance shall receive
subsequent approval for other applications for development approval, unless the
relevant and applicable portions of this Code or other applicable provisions
are met.
   (7)   Time limit. No variance shall be valid for a period longer than 12
months of the date of variance approval, unless the applicant receives approval
of a zoning permit.
   (8)   Amendment of a variance after a decision. When an amendment is
requested that would increase the extent or severity of the variance, the
variance shall be amended, extended or modified only in accordance with the
procedures and standards established for its original approval. An amendment
that reduces the extent or severity of the approved variance may be approved by
the Planning Director (for example, if the original variance grants a ten-foot
variance on a 20-foot setback, the Planning Director may approve an amendment
if the applicant only needs a five-foot variance).
   (9)   Appeals of BZA decisions. Those aggrieved by the decision of the BZA
or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the County Court of Common Pleas,
as provided in R.C. Ch. 2506.

affected by any order, decision, determination or interpretation made by the
authority having jurisdiction who is charged with the administration or
enforcement of this Code.
   (3)   Procedure.
      (A)   Step 1 - submission of appeal (application).

Division shall transmit the written appeal with all papers, documents and other
materials related to the appealed decision or determination to the BZA. This
material shall constitute the record of the appeal.
      (C)   Step 3 - BZA review and decision on appeal.
         1.)   The BZA shall hold a public hearing within 45 days of the filing
of the appeal provided adequate notification is provided pursuant to §
157.047(7).
         2.)   Any person affected by the appeal may appear at the public
hearing and testify in person or by attorney.
         3.)   The Board shall render a decision on the appeal without
unreasonable delay. The Zoning Division shall notify the appellant in writing
of the decision of the Board.
   (4)   Review criteria. A decision or determination shall not be reversed or
modified, unless there is competent, material and substantial evidence in the
record that the decision or determination fails to comply with either the
procedural or substantive requirements of this Code.
   (5)   Stay. A properly submitted appeal shall stay all administrative
proceedings by the city in furtherance of the action appealed, unless the
Zoning Division certifies to the BZA that a stay would cause imminent peril to
life or property, in which case the administrative proceedings shall not be
stayed unless a restraining order is granted by the BZA for good cause shown.
   (6)   Appeals of BZA decisions. Those aggrieved by the decision of the BZA
or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the County Court of Common Pleas,
as provided in R.C. Ch. 2506.

   (3)   Interpretation of district boundaries. The following rules shall be
used to interpret the precise location of any zoning district boundary
illustrated on the zoning map.
      (A)   All zoning district boundaries proposed after the effective date of
this Code shall follow lot lines or street centerlines to the maximum extent
feasible.
      (B)   For zoning district boundaries that existed prior to the effective
date of this Code, the following rules shall apply.
         1.)   Where district boundaries are so indicated as approximately
following the centerlines of thoroughfares or highways, street lines or highway
right-of-way lines, such centerlines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
         2.)   Whenever any street or public way is vacated by official action
of Council, the zoning districts adjoining each side of the street or public
way shall be automatically extended to the center of such vacations, and all
areas included in the vacation shall thereafter be subject to all regulations
of the extended districts.
         3.)   Where a zoning line does not follow a street, alley or lot line,
the district boundary lines shall be determined by the use of the scale
appearing on the zoning map or by dimensions.
   (4)   Existing planned developments. Any planned development approved prior
to the effective date of this Code shall continue in accordance with the
approved general plan(s) and final site plan(s). Modifications, amendments and
expansion of existing planned developments shall be in accordance with §
157.048(6).
   (5)   Relationship of overlay zoning districts. Where land is classified
into an overlay district, as well as a base zoning district, the regulations
governing development in the overlay district shall apply in addition to the
regulations governing the underlying base district. In the event of an express
conflict between the standards of the overlay zoning district and the base
zoning district, the standards governing the overlay district shall control.
(Prior Code, § 1225.02) (Ord. 2009-21, passed 10-27-2009)
§ 157.072 ZONING DISTRICTS.

uses and personal service uses designed to serve nearby residential
neighborhoods. Business in the B-3 District shall accommodate such service and
retail uses by maintaining the characteristics of the surrounding residential
uses and providing appropriate buffers to minimize or eliminate impacts on the
residential uses. This District may be appropriate for areas designated as
transitional areas in the Long Range Land Use Plan.
   (7)   B-4 - Highway Business District. The B-4 Highway Business District is
designed to accommodate commercial activities that draw business primarily from
a regional market area and provide services primarily to motorists. The B-
4 District is designed to accommodate land that is typically associated with
interstate travel. The regulations contained in this chapter are established to
protect the health, safety and welfare of the properties within and adjacent to
the District and to ensure the availability of suitable areas for the permitted
uses by prohibiting unrelated uses in such areas.
   (8)   B-5 - Airport Commerce District. The B-5 Airport Commerce District is
designed to accommodate business activities that can provide services related
to airport users including, but not limited to, hotels, car rental facilities
and restaurants. The B-5 District is also designed to accommodate offices,
public facilities, industrial uses and uses not related to the airport that
will not create an impact on the airport operations and are deemed a compatible
use.
   (9)   I-1 - General Industrial District. The I-1 General Industrial District
is established to provide for industrial uses which are generally major
operations and extensive in character for the purpose of repairing, storing,
manufacturing, processing or distributing goods. Such uses require large sites,
open storage and service areas, extensive services and facilities, and ready
access to regional transportation, and normally generate some nuisances, such
as smoke, noise, vibration, dust, glare, air pollution, and water pollution,
but not beyond the District boundary. Such operations shall be in locations
remote from existing or proposed residential areas.
   (10)   PD - Planned Development District. The PD Planned Development
District is established to accommodate, in a unified development, creative and
imaginative planned community design and to permit those innovations in the
technology of land development that are in the best interests of the city. It
is the purpose of this District to:
      (A)   Provide maximum opportunity for orderly, large-scale developments
which benefit the community as a whole by offering a greater choice of living
environments and commercial activities through both residential and commercial
uses;
      (B)   Provide greater flexibility in the spacing of lots and buildings in
order to encourage the following:
         1.)   Provide for pedestrian and vehicular circulation in a safe
manner;
         2.)   Provision of readily accessible recreation areas and green
spaces;
         3.)   Conservation of the natural amenities of the landscape; and
         4.)   Creation of functional and interesting residential, business,
and mixed-use areas.
      (C)   Permit suitable associated commercial development consistent with
the demand created by planned residential development and compatible with the
existing and proposed use of lands adjacent to the planned development;
      (D)   Encourage sound planning principles in the arrangement of
buildings, the preservation of open space, the utilization of topography and
other site features; and
      (E)   Allow for creative development that conforms to the goals and
objectives set forth in the Long Range Land Use Plan.

         1.)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at any one
time during development, construction, extraction or other use;
         2.)   When land is exposed during development, use, extraction and the
like, the exposure should be kept to the shortest practical period of time;
         3.)   Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect
critical areas exposed during development, use and the like;
         4.)   Sediment basins (debris basins, desilting basins or silt traps)
shall be installed and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from
land undergoing development, use and the like;
         5.)   Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the
increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after
development, use and the like;
         6.)   The permanent final vegetation and structures shall be installed
as soon as practical in the development, use, restoration, rehabilitation and
the like;
         7.)   The development, extraction or use plan shall be fitted to the
topography and soils so as to create the least erosion potential;
         8.)   Wherever feasible, natural vegetation should be retained and
protected; and
         9.)   All excavations shall be made to either a water producing depth,
such depth to be not less than five feet below the low water mark, or shall be
graded or backfilled with non-noxious, nonflammable and noncombustible solids,
to secure that:
            a.)   The excavated area shall not collect and permit to remain
therein stagnant water; or
            b.)   The surface of such area which is not permanently submerged
is graded or backfilled as necessary to reduce the peaks and depressions
thereof so as to produce a gently running surface that will minimize erosion
due to rainfall and which will be in substantial conformity to the adjoining
land area. The banks of all excavations shall be sloped to the water line at a
slope which shall not be greater than three feet horizontal to one foot
vertical, and said bank shall be needed.
      (O)   A conditional use permit issued for mineral extraction purposes
shall be issued for a period of no more than 12 consecutive months, subject to
renewal for no more than an additional 12-month period; provided that the Mayor
and/or City Council is satisfied that the holder of the conditional use
certificate is complying with this Code, and with all conditions set forth in
the conditional use permit.
      (P)   Regarding all conditional use permits issued pursuant to §
157.052, if either the Mayor or City Council determines that the holder of the
conditional use permit is violating the Zoning Code or any of the conditions
set forth in the conditional use permit, the Mayor or City Council may
authorize the Law Director to immediately notify the certificate holder of the
violation(s) and demand the permit holder to remedy the violation(s) within ten
calendar days of the date of the notice. The Mayor and City Council shall also
have the authority to request the Law Director immediately institute legal
action for a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction against
the permit holder to cease operations until such time that the permit holder
proves that they are conducting operations in compliance with this Code and any
conditions set forth in the conditional use permit.
      (Q)   In addition to the right to seek injunctive relief, the city may
also assess a fine in the amount of $100 for each day a violation of the
conditional use permit exists and/or continues up to a maximum fine of $10,000.
      (R)   A bond or other financial provision acceptable to City Council
guaranteeing performance according to plan and the removal from the site, after
termination of operations, of any abandoned equipment and accessories, shall be
submitted to Council, in an amount per acre, or fraction thereof, of not less
than $2,500, and in a total amount of not less than $25,000. The amount of the
bond or guarantee shall be sufficient to ensure rehabilitation for the number
of acres planned for operations during at least the ensuing 12 consecutive
months. Such bond shall be of the type recognized in the state.
      (S)   The conditions and limitations provided in this division (9), as
well as others deemed necessary by the PZC, shall be specified as conditions
for the issuance of a conditional use permit and shall be so specified on the

locations. The contacted providers shall be requested to respond in writing to
the inquiry within 60 days. The applicant shall present proof of mailing, as
well as responses to the PZC as a means of demonstrating the need for a new
tower. If a contacted wireless service provider fails to respond to a written
request for co-location from the applicant within 60 days, the PZC may accept
the nonresponse as proof that co-location on an existing tower is not feasible.
         8.)   No advertising is permitted anywhere on the facility, with the
exception of identification signage.
         9.)   No trespassing signs shall be posted around the facility, with a
telephone number of who to contact in the event of an emergency.

conform to all applicable existing zoning regulations, all development
standards contained herein and the following supplementary regulations.
         1.)   In applying for site plan review to construct a wireless
telecommunications tower/facility in any residential district, the applicant
must present substantial evidence as to why it is not technically feasible to
locate in a more appropriate nonresidential zone. Once those efforts to locate
in a nonresidential zone have been exhausted, a wireless telecommunications
facility may be located in a residential district.
         2.)   When the telecommunications facility is located on property with
another principal use, the applicant shall present documentation that the owner
of the property has granted an easement or entered into a lease for the
proposed facility and that vehicular access is provided to the facility.
      (D)   Placement of antennas and equipment. The placing of wireless

no approved plan; and
            d.)   Will have a minimum adverse impact to the surrounding areas.
         3.)   If, due to the nature of the proposed fence, the Planning
Department through the Zoning Division does not make such a determination, the
request shall be referred to the BZA and considered by the Board according to
the appeals procedures set forth in §
157.055.

offices, or a trucking business where drivers or employees gather at the home
before being dispatched from the home for the purposes of the home occupation.
         5.)   The occupation shall not generate a significantly greater volume
of traffic than would normally be expected in a residential area and all
parking shall be accommodated in the resident’s driveway.
         6.)   There shall be no change in the outside appearance of the
dwelling or other visible evidence of the conduct of such home occupation.

yard; and
         3.)   The satellite dish shall not exceed ten feet in diameter.

(Prior Code, § 1226.04) (Ord. 2009-21, passed 10-27-2009)
§ 157.089 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (1)   Purpose. In the provisions established by this Code, there exist uses
of land, structures, lots of record, towers and signs that were lawfully
established before this Code was adopted or amended, that now do not conform to
its terms and requirements. The purpose and intent of this section is to
regulate the continued existence of those uses, structures and lots of record
that do not conform to the provisions of this Code, or any amendments thereto.
   (2)   General provisions.
      (A)   Authority to continue. The lawful use of any dwelling or structure
and of any land or premises existing and lawful at the time of the enactment of
this Code, or any amendment thereto, may continue, although such use does not
conform to the provisions of this Code or amendment thereto. Nevertheless,
while it is the intent of this Code that such nonconformities be allowed to
continue until removed, they should not be encouraged to survive. Therefore, no
nonconformity may be moved, extended, altered, expanded or used as grounds for
any other use or structure prohibited elsewhere in the district without the
approval of the BZA, except as otherwise specifically provided for in this
Code.
      (B)   Conditional uses. Any use which is permitted as a conditional use
in a district under the terms of this Code shall not be deemed a nonconforming
use in such district, but shall without further action be considered a
conforming use; provided the use meets all approval criteria and conditions
established by the PZC for the conditional use.
      (C)   Accessory uses. A nonconforming use that is accessory to a
principal use shall not make the principal use nonconforming.
      (D)   Determination of nonconformity status. The burden of establishing
that a nonconformity lawfully exists shall be on the owner of the land on which
the purported nonconformity is located.
      (E)   Exception due to variance. The requirements of this section shall
not apply to a development standard or feature that is the subject of an
approved variance. Where a variance has been granted for a development standard
or feature that does not otherwise conform to the requirements of this Code,
that development standard or feature shall be deemed conforming.
      (F)   Minor repairs and normal maintenance. Minor repairs and normal
maintenance that are required to keep nonconforming uses, structures and lots
of record in a safe condition are permitted; provided the minor repair or
maintenance does not extend, expand or enlarge the nonconforming use, structure
or lot of record. For the purposes of this section, MINOR REPAIR or NORMAL
MAINTENANCE shall mean the following.
         1.)   Maintenance of safe condition. Repairs necessary to maintain a
nonconforming use, structure and lot of record in a safe condition.
         2.)   Correction of damage or deterioration. Repairs necessary to
correct any damage or deterioration to the structural soundness or interior
appearance of a structure without altering the structure.
         3.)   Maintenance of land for safety. Maintenance of land areas to
protect against health hazards and to promote the safety of surrounding uses.
      (G)   Change of tenancy or ownership. Changes of tenancy or ownership of
an existing nonconformity are permitted but shall continue to be subject to the
requirements of this section.
   (3)   Substitution of nonconforming uses. If no structural alterations are
made, a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming
use of the same or a more restricted classification, as determined by the BZA.
Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a more restricted use or to a
conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted
use.
   (4)   Continuation of nonconforming uses. Where, at the time of adoption of
this Code, lawful uses of land exist which would not be permitted by the
regulations imposed by this Code, the uses may be continued so long as they
remain otherwise lawful, provided the following.
      (A)   Any structure existing on or before the effective date of this Code
which does not conform to the provisions of this Code for the district in which
it is located, and which has been or may hereafter be damaged by fire or other
causes to the extent of less than 60% of its replacement value at the time of
destruction or damage, may be restored or reconstructed; provided that such
structure, when completed, will not differ in location or size from the
previously existing structure. However, when the damage or destruction to said
structure is to the extent of 60% or more of its replacement value at the time
of destruction or damage, it shall not be restored except in conformity with
the regulations of the district in which the structure is situated.
      (B)   In the event that a nonconforming use of any dwelling, building or
structure, or of any land or premises, is voluntarily discontinued for a period
of six months or more, any future use of said dwelling, building, structure,
land or premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Code.
      (C)   Any partially completed building, the actual construction of which
has commenced on or before the effective date of this Code, which building or
its intended use, when completed, would not conform to the provisions of this
Code for the district in which it is located, may be completed and used as a
nonconforming use only for the purpose for which it was originally designed;
provided that the building is completed and/or put to use within two years
after the adoption of this Code.
      (D)   Any dwelling existing in a residential district at the time such
district becomes a business or industrial district, shall have the same right
that it had before the zone change without having to apply to the BZA, until it
ceases to be used as a dwelling.
   (5)   Continuation of nonconforming sexually oriented business uses. Any
sexually oriented business lawfully operating on the effective date of this
Code that is in violation of this Code shall be deemed a nonconforming use. A
sexually oriented business lawfully operating as a conforming use is not
rendered a nonconforming use by the subsequent location of a church, public or
private elementary or secondary school, public park, or library within 1,000
feet, or a residential district within 500 feet, of the sexually oriented
business. When a nonconforming sexually oriented business use of a structure or
premises is voluntarily discontinued or abandoned for more than six months, the
structure, building or premises shall not thereafter be used, except in
conformity with the requirements of the zoning district in which it is located.
   (6)   Nonconformity due to site conditions. Where a dwelling is
nonconforming only because the front yard setback does not meet the
requirements of this Code, the Zoning Division shall issue a zoning permit for
the extension, enlargement or alteration of said dwelling without requiring an
appeal to the BZA; provided that no other requirement of this Code is violated
and that the extent of the nonconformity is not increased.
   (7)   Variance of the provisions of this chapter.
      (A)   Any dwelling, building or other structure, or any land or premises,
the use of which does not conform to the provisions of this Code or any
amendment thereto, for the district in which it is located, may not be
extended, enlarged or altered for the purpose of any nonconforming use as
carried on in such structure or on such land.
      (B)   The property owner or applicant may apply for a variance with the
BZA to allow for the extension, enlargement or alteration of a nonconforming
use if, in the BZA’s opinion, such variance will not be contrary to the public
interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this
Code will result in unnecessary hardship and so that the spirit of this Code
shall be observed and substantial justice done.
   (8)   Modifications for lots of record. Any lot of record or lot for which a
land contract has been issued, or any parcel within an unrecorded allotment of
which at least one-half of the lots are of record or have been sold on land
contract before the effective date of this Code, shall be subject to all of the
requirements of this Code, except that:
      (A)   For any lot having a width less than the minimum dimension
specified in §§
157.100 through
157.104 , each side yard may be 10% of the width of the lot at the building
line, but no less than ten feet wide; and
      (B)   For any lot having an area less than the minimum dimension
specified in §§
157.100 through
157.104 , the rear yard shall be at least 20% of the average depth of the lot,
but no less than 40 feet deep.

SITE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
§ 157.100 MEASUREMENTS, COMPUTATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
   (1)   Distance measurements. Unless otherwise expressly stated, distances
specified in this Code are to be measured as the length of an imaginary
straight line joining those points.
   (2)   Lot area measurements.
      (A)   Lot area measurements. The area of a lot includes the total area
within the lot lines of a lot, excluding any street right-of-way or other legal
public dedication. For nonconforming lots, see §
157.089.
      (B)   Reductions in lot area prohibited. No lot shall be reduced in area
so that lot area per dwelling unit, lot width, yards, building area or other
requirements of this Code are not maintained.
   (3)   Lot width measurements. Lot width is the horizontal distance between
the side lot lines measured at the required front setback or at the building
line for any irregularly shaped lot.
   (4)   Setbacks and yards.
      (A)   Measurements. Setbacks refer to the unobstructed, unoccupied open
area between the foundation of the structure to the nearest lot line on which
the structure is located. Any projection of the structure that extends more
than two feet from the foundation shall meet the minimum setback requirements.
      (B)   Yards required for buildings. A yard or other open space required
about a building shall not be included as part of a yard or other open space
for another building.
      (C)   Front yard setback.
         1.)   Measurement. The front yard setback shall extend the full width
of the lot and shall be measured from the street right-of-way line to the
structure.
         2.)   Double frontage lot. A double frontage lot shall provide a front
yard setback on both streets. The remaining yards shall meet the side yard
setback requirements.
         3.)   Corner lot. A corner lot shall provide a front yard setback on
all streets. The remaining yards shall meet the side yard setback requirements.
         4.)   Cul-de-sac or curved street lot. For a cul-de-sac lot or a lot
abutting a curved street, the front yard setback shall follow the curve of the
front property line.
      (D)   Architectural projections. Open structures, such as porches,
canopies, balconies, platforms, carports, covered patios and similar
architectural projections, shall be considered parts of the building to which
such open structures are attached and shall not project into the required
minimum front, side or rear yards.
   (5)   Height measurements and requirements.
      (A)   Height measurement.
         1.)   Building height shall be measured at the finished grade at front
of building for any elevation fronting on a public street, including attics,
half-stories, mezzanines and at-grade structured parking, but excluding
features that are completely below grade, such as basements, cellars, crawl
spaces, subbasements and underground parking structures.
         2.)   Where specified in feet, building height shall be measured as
follows:
            a.)   To the tallest point of the roof for flat roofs;
            b.)   To the deck line of mansard roofs; and
            c.)   To one-half the distance between the eaves and ridge for
gable, hip, and gambrel roofs.
      (B)   Height limit exceptions. Height limits shall not apply to belfries,
chimneys, church roof structures not intended for human occupancy, church
spires, clock towers, cupolas, domes, flagpoles, monuments, water towers, or
similar structures or appurtenances; provided, however, the following:
         1.)   The appurtenance does not interfere with Federal Aviation
Regulations, being 14 C.F.R. Part 77, Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace;
         2.)   The appurtenance does not extend more than 15 feet above the
maximum permitted building height, except as allowed in this Code;
         3.)   The appurtenance is not constructed for the purpose of providing
additional floor area in the building;
         4.)   The appurtenance complies with the screening requirements for
mechanical equipment and appurtenances in §§
157.136,
157.137 and
157.139; and
         5.)   Alternative energy systems; provided they meet requirements of
the applicable code regulating their use.
      (C)   Additional height allowance for appurtenances. All appurtenances,
as referenced in division (5)(B) of this section that exceed 15 feet above the
maximum permitted building height shall be permitted only upon approval by the
PZC.

visible from any public right-of-way or visible from parking areas with more
than five parking spaces shall be uniform and compatible with the architectural
style, color, and building materials of the principal building and its
surroundings and as approved by the DRB and the PZC.
   (6)   Vehicular and pedestrian circulation.
      (A)   Cul-de-sacs shall be discouraged, unless there is unique topography
or other hardships. The use of cul-de-sacs shall require approval by the PZC
and in no case shall more than 20% of the lots have frontage on a cul-de-sac.
      (B)   Sidewalks shall be provided on each side of every street and shall
be creatively developed to interconnect different land use areas and open
spaces.
      (C)   Pedestrian connections shall be provided between sidewalks and
buildings.
      (D)   Sidewalks in residential areas shall be a minimum of five feet in
width.
      (E)   Sidewalks in nonresidential or mixed use areas shall be of a
minimum to allow for six feet of clearance around any outdoor dining areas or
streetscaping elements, such as benches, trees and the like.
   (7)   Building design.
      (A)   All elevations of a building shall be subject to review. A front
facade shall be architecturally emphasized although all sides of a building
shall be architecturally consistent with the front facade.
      (B)   Buildings shall be architecturally oriented to the street or a
public right-of-way and the main entrance shall be located on the street facade
or facing the public right-of-way. In cases where there is an anti-access
easement or access is not permitted from a particular road or public right-of-
way, the building shall not be required to face the subject road or right-of-
way.
      (C)   Buildings shall be comprised of materials that provide for minimal
maintenance, provide a high quality of craftsmanship and aesthetics, and are
compatible with adjacent properties. Primary materials shall consist of brick,
stone and other decorative masonry products (i.e., no standard concrete masonry
units). The following shall be utilized by the DRB and PZC when reviewing
building materials as they apply discretion to the design of the building,
taking into account the scale and use of the building and design of the facades
(i.e., windows, doors and other design features) to achieve aesthetically-
complete principal and nonprincipal facades:
         1.)   Single-story multi-family buildings shall average a minimum of
60% primary materials on all principal facades and a minimum of 50% on all
nonprincipal facades, exclusive of glass, windows and doors;
         2.)   Multiple story multi-family buildings shall average a minimum of
65% primary materials on all principal facades and a minimum of 50% on all
nonprincipal facades, exclusive of glass, windows and doors;
         3.)   Commercial buildings shall average a minimum of 70% primary
materials on all principal and a minimum of 60% nonprincipal facades, exclusive
of glass, windows and doors;
         4.)   Industrial buildings shall average a minimum of 60% primary
materials on all principal and nonprincipal facades, exclusive of glass,
windows and doors;
         5.)   Mixed-use buildings shall average a minimum of 70% primary
materials on all principal facades and a minimum of 60% on all nonprincipal
facades, exclusive of glass, windows and doors;
         6.)   Nonmasonry materials, such as stucco, Exterior Insulation and
Finish System (EIFS), decorative wood/vinyl sidings and architectural metals,
may be permitted but shall be secondary, exclusive of gable areas;
         7.)   The DRB and PZC may allow other alternative material(s) as a
primary material if it is the basis of an acceptable facade and/or qualifies as
a material that meets the intent of this section; and
         8.)   The DRB shall review and make a recommendation to the PZC. The
PZC shall consider the DRB’s recommendation but retain discretion to determine
the final use of primary and secondary materials as they apply to the various
uses. The PZC shall also take into account the exposure to adjacent developed
properties and/or land for future development. The DRB and PZC may apply
discretion to the percentages noted by either requiring a greater percentage or
permitting a lesser percentage of primary materials.
      (D)   Flat rooflines are permitted with the use of cornices, parapets or
some form of architectural emphasis along the roofline.
      (E)   Colors.
         1.)   The use of neon lights or bright colors, as determined by the
PZC, for building materials shall be restricted to a maximum of 10% of each
building facade. The total area of neon or bright colors cannot be aggregated
onto one facade.
         2.)   All vents, gutters, downspouts, flashing, electrical conduits
and the like shall match the color of the adjacent surface, unless approved by
the DRB and PZC to be used expressly as a trim or accent element.
         3.)   The chosen color scheme should help tie all of the parts of the
building together. Typically, the color that is used in a storefront area
should be repeated in the upper story windows or cornice area.

development of the city though the establishment of general subdivision design
standards applicable to all subdivisions.
   (2)   Applicability. Unless otherwise noted, the standards of this section
shall apply to all subdivisions in the city.
   (3)   General layout and design provisions.
      (A)   Name of the subdivision. The name of the subdivision shall not
duplicate the name of an existing subdivision in the city.
      (B)   Compliance with other provisions of this Code. All subdivisions
shall comply with all other applicable regulations of this Code, including, but
not limited to:
         1.)   The requirements of the zoning district in which the property is
located;
         2.)   The requirements relative to specific uses and dimensional
standards; and
         3.)   Generally applicable development standards.
      (C)   Homeowner’s association. Where there are common areas proposed as
part of a subdivision that are to be deeded to a homeowner’s association, a
homeowner’s association shall be required and all documents related to the
association shall be on file prior to final plat approval and subsequently
recorded.
      (D)   Natural features. Subdivisions should be planned to take advantage
of the topography of the land, to economize in the construction of drainage
facilities, to reduce the amount of grading and to minimize destruction of
trees and topsoil.
      (E)   Flood hazards. If any portion of the land within the subdivision is
subject to flooding or other hazards, due consideration shall be given to such
problems in the design of the subdivision. Land subject to flooding and land
otherwise uninhabitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy, nor for
such other uses that may increase danger to health, life or property, or
aggravate the flood hazard as delineated on the FEMA floodplain maps or
detailed engineering studies.
   (4)   Construction specifications. All construction of streets, sidewalks
and infrastructure shall conform to the latest edition of the Ohio Department
of Transportation Construction and Material Specifications and any amendments
thereto. The City Engineer and/or the agencies having jurisdiction over
sanitary sewer or water (where applicable), may also require adjustments in
design to conform to special conditions inherent within a particular
subdivision including, but not limited to, swamps, quicksand, springs and
landslides.
   (5)   Infrastructure requirements.
      (A)   All subdivision of lands into parcels less than 32,670 square feet
and/or less than 100 feet in width at the building line shall have a
centralized sanitary sewer.
      (B)   All subdivision of lands into parcels, all of which are 32,670
square feet or more and/or 100 feet or more in width at the building line, may
be required to have centralized sanitary sewer and/or water facilities if they
are reasonably available as determined by the PZC.
      (C)   All sanitary sewage systems that will be dedicated to and operated
by the county, as approved by the County Council and the County Executive
through the agency having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer, shall conform to
the design standards, specifications and procedures of the agency having
jurisdiction over sanitary sewer as adopted by County Council and as approved
by the County Executive pursuant to § 3.04 of the Summit County Charter.
      (D)   All public roadways shall meet the typical specifications on record
with the Planning Department and Engineering Department. Any deviation from the
typical specifications requires approval by the PZC.
   (6)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be provided for all roadway sections,
unless waived by the PZC. All sidewalks shall be five feet in width and shown
on the subdivision improvement plans. Sidewalks shall meet the typical
specification on record with the City’s Planning Department and Engineering
Department. In cases where a proposed sidewalk will connect with an existing
sidewalk of narrower dimensions, the new sidewalk shall transition to the
existing sidewalk via taper.
   (7)   Street lighting district. Street lighting fixtures shall be installed
by the developer on all streets within major subdivisions where sidewalks are
required, the number and location of which shall be determined by engineering
studies performed by the authority having jurisdiction over electric power, and
shall conform to the specifications established by such authority and the City
Engineer. The developer shall submit, at the time of the PZC approval, a
petition to create a street lighting district so that legislation creating said
district will be approved simultaneously with the plat and performance bond.
   (8)   Street trees. Street trees shall be required along all streets where
sidewalks are required. The developer shall provide, on the subdivision
improvement plans, the locations of new trees to be planted in the street
right-of-way in conjunction with the requirements of sidewalk installations and
in accordance with the proposed street lighting district layout. Tree variety
shall be from a list of approved trees available from the Planning Department
or as approved by a consultant to the city.

      (B)   Utility lines. All utility lines shall be located underground.
   (10)   Soil studies. The City Engineer reserves the right to require a soil
study where, in their opinion, the existing soil conditions are below average
and may also require adjustments in design to compensate for the existing
conditions.
   (11)   Erosion and sedimentation control.
      (A)   When the developer intends to remove or disturb the natural
topsoil, trees and other vegetation, or where the developer intends to change
the surface contour of a proposed subdivision, he or she shall prepare an
erosion control plan (ECP) and have such plan approved by the County Soil and
Water Conservation District and the city. The ECP shall be included in the
improvement drawings. Additionally, a land disturbance permit shall be
required.
      (B)   In general, erosion and sedimentation control work shall consist
of, but not be limited to, grading, soil preparation, fertilizing, seeding and
mulching as necessary to establish a sufficient growth of grass or other ground
cover that minimizes damage to subdivision areas and to adjoining properties.
The City Engineer and the County Soil and Water Conservation District will have
the work inspected to the extent that they determine is necessary to ensure
that the developer has complied with the approved plans.
   (12)   Oversize and/or off-site improvements.

by the agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water, if necessary,
prior to approval of the final plat by the City Engineer.
   (14)   Construction and inspection of improvements.
      (A)   Cooperation of developer and/or contractor. The developer and/or
contractor shall have available on the project site at all times one approved
copy of all required plans and specifications. He or she shall cooperate with
the City Engineer’s inspector and/or the inspectors for agencies having
jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water (where applicable), and with other
contractors in every way possible. The developer and/or contractor shall, at
all times, have a competent representative acting as his or her agent on the
project. The representative shall be capable of reading and thoroughly
understanding the plans and specifications and promptly supplying such
materials, tools, plat equipment and labor as may be required. A representative
shall be furnished regardless of the amount of work sublet.
      (B)   Inspections.
         1.)   The City Engineer shall be responsible for the inspection of all
street, structure and drainage improvements. The developer, his or her
engineer, or his or her contractor shall give notice to the City Engineer at
least 24 hours in advance of any construction of physical public improvements.
The agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water shall be
responsible for inspection of all sanitary (sewage) and water supply system
improvements. The following operations will be inspected by the City Engineer’s
office:
            a.)   Preliminary grading;
            b.)   Backfilling of all trenches and excavations in the right-of-
way;
            c.)   Preparation of the subgrade;

            l.)   Any construction of structures within the right-of-way.
         2.)   Any of the above listed construction operations that are
performed without advance notice to the City Engineer’s office may result in
coring of the pavement, subgrade boring and nonacceptance of the improvement if
it does not meet the specifications of the City Engineer. Costs to provide
sufficient proof that any work performed is acceptable shall be the
responsibility of the contractor.
      (C)   Inspection fees. The fees shall cover the actual wage, salary or
contract cost of the inspection service, plus overhead, as determined by the
City Engineer and/or the agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or
water (where applicable), to cover such items as employee benefits, engineering
service and transportation. The developer shall be held responsible for all
inspection fees, which will be payable monthly. The performance bond posted by
the developer guarantees the payment of all inspection fees and no bonds will
be released until all current inspection fees have been paid in full.
      (D)   Roadway construction. All work shall be done in conformance with
the approved improvement plans and the Ohio Department of Transportation
Construction and Material Specifications, as supplied by the City Engineer’s
notes. This information shall be available upon request from the City
Engineer’s office.
      (E)   Construction staking. The setting and marking of all line, profile
and grade stakes necessary for the layout of the work in accordance with the
construction plans will be performed under the supervision of a registered
professional surveyor. Should any misunderstanding arise as to the intent or
meaning of the construction plans, or any discrepancy appear in the same, or in
the proper methods of setting and marking of the construction stakes, the
decision of the City Engineer in such cases shall be final. Pavement and pipe
grade stakes shall be set at 25-foot intervals on horizontal and vertical
curves and for all grades less than 1%. Tangent pavement grades and pipe grades
over 1% may be set at a maximum interval of 50 feet. The City Engineer’s
inspector may ask for additional grade stakes if it is deemed necessary. A
laser control method as approved by the City Engineer may be substituted for
the above.
      (F)   Testing. All material supplied shall be plant inspected as directed
by the City Engineer. Compaction tests shall be made in fill areas in the
right-of-way and on the subgrade prior to paving, as directed by the City
Engineer. Pavement tests shall be conducted on site as directed by the City
Engineer. The City Engineer reserves the right to order pavement cores made if
conditions warrant. The testing mentioned above shall be done by a private
testing laboratory acceptable to the City Engineer and shall be done at no cost
to the city.
      (G)   Field changes. Approval of final plans shall not prevent the City
Engineer or his or her agent from ordering needed changes he or she deems
necessary in the field as work progresses. This extra work shall be at the
developer’s expense. If it becomes necessary to modify the improvements as
approved due to unforeseen circumstances, the developer shall inform the City
Engineer, in writing, of the conditions requiring modification. Written
authorization from the City Engineer to make the required modification must be
received by the developer and/or the developer’s engineer before proceeding
with the construction of the improvement.
      (H)   Street name signs, stop signs and other required regulatory
signage. The developer shall be responsible for the cost of the signs and
installation of street name signs, stop signs and other required regulatory
signs as agreed upon and authorized at the preconstruction meeting with the
city prior to the start of construction. The materials, construction, methods
and location shall be approved so as to meet city standards and regulations.
Installation shall be complete at such time as the hard surface is open to
construction vehicles servicing individual sites within the subdivision. No
zoning permits shall be issued for structures within the subdivision prior to
the installation of street name signs.
   (15)   Final acceptance of improvements in major subdivisions.
      (A)   Monuments. Monuments shall be set where shown on the approved
subdivision plat. Before final acceptance of the improvement, the developer
shall have his or her registered professional surveyor certify to the City
Engineer, in writing, that all required monuments and iron pins are in place
and that any monuments or pins that were removed during construction have been
replaced.
      (B)   As built drawings. At the completion of the construction and before
acceptance, the developer’s engineer shall update for the City Engineer and the
agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water (where applicable),
the set of linen or Mylar tracings for permanent record, showing the locations,
sizes and elevations of all improvements as constructed. An electronic media
version shall also be submitted in a program compatible with the city’s
computer systems.
      (C)   Final inspection. Upon completion of all improvements, including
roads, grading, culverts, seeding, mulching, monumentation, street name signs
and other items, the developer shall notify the City Engineer and/or the
agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer or water (where applicable),
by letter, that all of the improvements have been completed. The Planning
Department will then schedule an inspection of the completed improvements with
the City Engineer and Service Director. The developer, his or her engineer and
a city representative may accompany the City Engineer or his or her
representative on the inspection. Any discrepancies shall be recorded and the
developer and the contractor will be furnished a copy of this report, and shall
be expected to proceed as soon as possible with any corrections. Another final
inspection will be made for acceptance.
      (D)   Recommendation for acceptance. If the construction is found to be
satisfactory and all inspection monies are paid, the City Engineer, Service
Director, Planning Director and/or the agencies having jurisdiction over
sanitary sewer or water (where applicable), will make a recommendation to the
Mayor for final acceptance of the improvements and release of the performance
bond and acceptance of the maintenance bond.
   (16)   Maintenance bond period.
      (A)   Maintenance of improvements.
         1.)   The developer shall be responsible for the maintenance of the
improvements during the construction period and for a minimum period of two
years after release of the performance bond and acceptance of the maintenance
bond. The developer is responsible to request that the city inspect the
improvements. Upon inspection by the city, the developer shall be notified of
the need for any corrections to be made to the improvements. Should the
developer fail to perform such necessary improvements within the time
specified, the city may perform said improvements, at which time the developer
will forfeit a portion of the cash maintenance bond to pay for said
improvements.
         2.)   The maintenance of sanitary sewer and water supply systems shall
be the responsibility of the agencies having jurisdiction over sanitary sewer
or water or the owner of said service line, upon acceptance by either the city
or the respective representative of the owner, subject to call on any bonds if
repair work is necessary within a one-year period after acceptance.
      (B)   Repair of damage. Any damage done to the improvements by
construction traffic, local traffic or any other means shall be repaired, or
the damaged materials replaced, before the next phase of construction is begun.
      (C)   Snow and ice removal. Prior to the release of the performance bond,
the developer shall perform all work necessary to keep the road passable for
automobile traffic to service all families living in the subdivision. The roads
shall be open for emergency equipment at all times for all occupied dwellings.
Should the developer fail to provide a passable roadway, the city may request
all costs and expenses incurred in maintaining said roadway from the bonding
company. Upon the release of the performance bond, the city shall accept
responsibility for the snow and ice removal on accepted roads, even though they
may be covered by a maintenance bond.
      (D)   Mud removal. The developer and his or her contractor shall be
responsible for the removal of mud or other debris that may become located on
the pavement surface. Should the developer fail to perform the said removal, he
or she shall be liable for all costs and expenses incurred in the removal of

(Prior Code, § 1229.01) (Ord. 2009-21, passed 10-27-2009; Ord. 2018-13, passed
8-28-2018)
§ 157.131 TRANSPORTATION AND ACCESS.
   (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to support the creation of a
highly connected transportation system within the city in order to:
      (A)   Provide choices for drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians;
      (B)   Increase the effectiveness of municipal service delivery;
      (C)   Promote walking and bicycling as an alternative mode of
transportation;
      (D)   Connect neighborhoods to each other and to local destinations;
      (E)   Reduce vehicle miles of travel and travel time;
      (F)   Reduce emergency response time; and
      (G)   Mitigate traffic impacts of new development.
   (2)   Applicability. The standards of this section shall apply to all
development in the city.
   (3)   Traffic impact study required. To promote efficient access management,
the Planning Director may request a traffic impact study be conducted by the
developer for any project he or she feels warrants the study at the time of
submission of the preliminary plan, general plan or site plan. The Planning
Director may base his or her decision on one or more of the following:
      (A)   The proposed development generates 100 or more added new peak hour
trips to and/or from the site during the adjacent roadway’s peak hours or
during the development’s peak hour, and the proposed development generates more
than 1,000 trips daily;
      (B)   The development is within 500 feet of a high-accident (five or more
per year) intersection or section of roadway;
      (C)   One or more of the proposed access drives to the development is
within 500 feet of a public roadway intersection or within 250 feet of a drive
that is a high traffic volume generator as determined by the City Engineer;
      (D)   The traffic generated by the proposed development will increase the
ADT by 25% or more on roadways in adjacent neighborhoods, as determined by the
City Engineer;
      (E)   Traffic volumes of 10,000 ADT or higher exist on roadways adjacent
to the proposed development; or
      (F)   The City Engineer determines that other conditions exist in the
vicinity of the proposed development that may be negatively impacted by the
development.
   (4)   General provisions.
      (A)   General circulation.
         1.)   Site limitations and site layout. Uses, buildings, parking
areas, drives and other site features shall be designed to be suitable for the
site location and conditions, and shall not create on-site or off-site traffic
impacts which exceed those normally expected to be caused by uses in the
district.
         2.)   Public street access. Curb cuts and drives providing access
between a site and a public or private street shall be designed to:
            a.)   Minimize unnecessary impacts on the street, including, but
not limited to, poor visibility, steep grades, slowing or obstruction of
traffic, causing unusual, confusing or sudden traffic movements, or unnecessary
points of conflict with vehicles on the street and with vehicles in nearby
access drives;
            b.)   Minimize negative impacts on pedestrians by providing good
visibility between pedestrians and vehicles, and by providing safe pedestrian
walking and standing areas;
            c.)   Create points of access appropriate for the configuration of
the property and the proposed use, but in no greater number than necessary to
provide reasonable access to the site;
            d.)   Provide sufficient distance between the street and potential
points of vehicular or pedestrian conflict within the site (including, but not
limited to, cars backing into travel lanes, driveway or parking aisle
intersections, pedestrian crossings, or loading areas) to prevent obstruction
of drives and traffic backups in the street;
            e.)   Provide a landscaped median where a curb cut is designed to
accommodate more than three lanes of traffic; provided that priority shall be
given to proper alignment and sight lines coordinated with other drives in the
area. The width of any such median shall not be calculated into the total width
of the driveway; and
            f.)   Reconstruct or eliminate existing nonconforming access, such
as oversized curb cuts or parking lots which cause obstruction of street
traffic, to comply with the provisions of this Code.
         3.)   Cross access with abutting sites. Where physically feasible and
appropriate for reducing points of conflict in the street, property owners
requesting approval for more than one access drive on a public street frontage
shall, as directed by the PZC or the Planning Department, make a written
request for joint access drives to the owners of the abutting properties having
frontage on the same street. The applicant shall provide to the city a copy of
the request and any response. Such provision shall not apply to single-family
and two-family dwellings.
      (B)   Guardrails. A guardrail shall be installed as required by the City
Engineer. The guardrail shall be in accordance with state standards. The
subdivider shall submit details to the City Engineer for approval.
      (C)   Drives and driveway culverts. For drives and driveways along a city
highway, where a road opening permit is required from the Department of Public
Service, a bond may be required and the City Engineer’s specifications must be
complied with.
      (D)   Bridges. Bridges, being, by definition, a structure of greater than
a ten-foot span, shall be designed in accordance with the latest design
regulations as practiced in the Bureau of Bridges and approved by the City
Engineer. A copy of all bridge plans shall also be forwarded to the County
Engineer for review and comment. Reference shall also be made to current
standard bridge drawings. Design flood elevations shall be indicated on plan
profile sheets and on structure site plans.
   (5)   Street design standards.
      (A)   Arrangement.
         1.)   The arrangement, character, extent, width and location of all
streets shall conform to the Long Range Land Use Plan. Proposed streets and
public access to adjacent unplatted lands shall be designed so that the entire
area can be served with a coordinated public street system.
         2.)   The width of any right-of-way should be provided so that all
underground utilities can be located outside of pavement areas.
         3.)   All underground utilities should be placed within a utility
easement in accordance with §
157.130(9).
      (B)   Dedication. Unless otherwise approved as a private street, all
street rights-of-way shall be dedicated to the public in fee simple.
      (C)   Private streets.
         1.)   Private streets shall comply with the design standards and
bonding requirements of this chapter. All references in this section to the
public right-of-way shall apply to private street lots.
         2.)   The private street access shall provide perpetual access for
authorized emergency vehicles, public and private utility maintenance and
service personnel, solid waste collection services, the U.S. Postal Services,
and government employees in pursuit of their official duties.
         3.)   Gates on private streets shall only be permitted with approval
from the PZC and the Fire Division.
         4.)   The city may, but is not obligated to, accept private streets
for public access and maintenance. The procedure for requesting the city to
accept private streets shall be as follows:
            a.)   A petition shall be submitted to City Council, signed by all
property owners with access to the subject private street;
            b.)   All of the streets and roadways shall be in a condition that
is acceptable to the city at the time the petition is submitted;
            c.)   All access control structures, signage and other structures
not consistent with a public street shall be removed;
            d.)   If any maintenance or repair of the private streets is
required in order for acceptance, the city may use any outstanding balance of
funds established through a homeowner’s association or the city may assess each
individual property owner on a fair and equitable basis as determined by the
City Engineer; and
            e.)   Each lot owner shall execute an instrument of dedication for
filing of record, the form of which shall be approved by the Law Director.
      (D)   Classification.
         1.)   Major arterial thoroughfares shall be planned for continuation
of movement of traffic between points of heavy traffic generation and from one
section of the community to another. Said thoroughfare shall contain as few
intersections with minor streets as possible.
         2.)   Local streets shall provide direct and full access to each lot
and shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
The street system shall be so designed that all proposed streets shall be in
general conformity to a plan for the most advantageous development of the
entire neighborhood. The streets shall be extended to the boundaries of the
tract to be recorded, unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions, or unless, in the opinion of the PZC, such extension is not
necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision
with the development of adjacent tracts.
         3.)   Parallel streets may be required along an existing or proposed
major arterial thoroughfare to provide access to lots along such major arterial
thoroughfares.
      (E)   Street design. Streets shall be designed in accordance with the
city’s typical street standards as available in the City Engineer’s office.
      (F)   Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited, except where there
is an existing half street adjacent to the subdivision, in which case the
remaining half of the street shall be platted.
      (G)   Cul-de-sac and dead-end streets.
         1.)   Dead-end streets or cul-de-sacs will be approved only when
necessitated by topography or other physical conditions or where they are
appropriate for the type of development contemplated.
         2.)   A street designed to be a permanent cul-de-sac, which contains
central water service and fire hydrants for its full length, may serve up to 25
lots; otherwise a permanent cul-de-sac shall not be longer than 1,000 feet.
Permanent cul-de-sacs shall be provided at the closed end with a paved turn-
around having an outside pavement radius of at least 37.5 feet and a street
right-of-way line radius of at least 50 feet or such greater dimension agreed
upon by the developer and the City Engineer.
         3.)   If a cul-de-sac is of a temporary nature and a future extension
into adjacent land is anticipated, then said turning circle beyond the normal
street width shall be in the nature of an easement. Such easements shall be
automatically vacated to abutting property owners when said dead-end street is
legally extended into adjacent land. If such dead-end street extends only the
depth of the corner lot past a street intersection, no turn-around will be
required. Subdividers shall be required to provide a two-foot reservation strip
in the name of the city at the end of all dead-end streets. This strip will
become public highway only upon extension of the dedicated street. The
developer extending the street will be responsible for removing the temporary
portions of the cul-de-sac, regrading, seeding and the like.
      (H)   Corner radii. Property lines at street intersections shall be
rounded with a radius of not less than 25 feet or as required by the City
Engineer.
      (I)   Vertical alignment. Simple parabolic vertical curves shall be used
to effect a gradual change between tangent grades where the algebraic
difference of grades in percent is greater than 0.50.
      (J)   Horizontal alignment. Angles in the alignment of street centerlines
shall be connected by a curve with a radius of not less than 300 feet for local
streets, 800 feet for collector and industrial streets, and 1,200 feet for
major arterial thoroughfares. Between reverse curves, there shall be a tangent
distance of 100 feet.
      (K)   Intersections.
         1.)   No more than four road legs will be permitted at any
intersection, unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer.
         2.)   Road intersection shall be at 90 degrees where practical, but in
no case less than 70 degrees.
         3.)   Each intersecting road shall have a tangent distance of at least
150 feet for local roads or a curve with a minimum 1,400 feet radius.
         4.)   Those roads intersecting each other from opposite sides shall be
directly opposite where possible. Street jogs with centerline off-sets shall be
prohibited, unless specifically approved by the PZC and the City Engineer.
         5.)   The minimum radius of right-of-way lines at intersection corners
shall be 25 feet.
         6.)   The intersection of subdivision roads shall have a minimum
horizontal sight distance of 400 feet.
         7.)   Back slopes shall be cut back to aid the sight distance as
required by the City Engineer.
         8.)   There shall be a minimum separation of 300 feet between
intersections.
      (L)   Boulevards and roadway islands. Boulevards and roadway islands
shall be permitted only when approved by the City Engineer and City Council.
      (M)   Curbs and gutters. Concrete curbs and gutters shall conform to
typical drawings as approved by the City Engineer. In addition, a ramp with a
nonslip surface shall be built into the curb at each pedestrian crosswalk so
that the sidewalk and street blend to a common level. Such ramps shall be
constructed in accordance with state standards insofar as feasible.
   (6)   Sidewalks and pedestrian facilities. All site elements shall be
located and designed in a manner which promotes safe and efficient movement of
pedestrians to, from and within the site. Pedestrian facilities and site
elements which affect pedestrian movement shall comply with the following
guidelines.
      (A)   Where physically possible and appropriate to the nature of the
abutting uses, on-site sidewalks shall be aligned to connect with similar
sidewalks on abutting sites.
      (B)   City Council may require the construction and dedication of
walkways and connecting sidewalks where it finds that such walkways are
necessary for pedestrian circulation between a proposed subdivision and
commercial uses, schools, parks and other public facilities. A minimum easement
width dedication shall be 20 feet and said sidewalk or walkway shall be a
minimum of five feet in width.
      (C)   Pedestrian facilities and parking lots and other areas which will
be utilized by pedestrians, shall be designed to facilitate pedestrian use,
with special attention given to use by persons with mobility limitations and by
persons transporting children or packages between vehicles and buildings. Where
main pedestrian routes are designed with steps or steep grades, alternative
routes shall be provided to comply with handicapped accessibility standards.
      (D)   Signs, pavement markings and/or special surface materials shall be
installed in any location on a site where necessary to promote pedestrian
safety at crossings of vehicular drives. Pedestrian crossings of major drives
shall be located and marked in a manner to encourage safe crossing.
      (E)   Bike storage racks and other bike-friendly facilities shall be
required where a site abuts or is in proximity to a bike route.
(Prior Code, § 1229.02) (Ord. 2009-21, passed 10-27-2009)
§ 157.132 DRAINAGE STANDARDS.
   (1)   Applicability. The standards of this section shall apply to all
development in the city.
   (2)   Drainage design.
      (A)   No development will be approved unless there is an outlet for all
storm water. Provisions shall be made to accommodate effectively the increased
runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after
development. It may be necessary to direct surface water to a drainage ditch,
stream or existing storm system which has the capacity to carry the flow. No
natural drainage course shall be altered and no fill, buildings or structures
shall be placed in, on or over it, unless provision is made for the flow of
water in a manner satisfactory to the City Engineer. An easement shall be
provided on both sides of an existing surface drainage course for the purpose
of maintaining, protecting, widening, deepening, enclosing or otherwise
improving such stream for drainage purposes.
      (B)   If the same is across private property, a right-of-way or easement
must be obtained by the subdivider or developer in the name of the city, as
reviewed and approved by the Planning Department and the City Engineer. These
rights-of-way or easements should be shown on the plat, site plan or
construction plans, as applicable. A copy of the recorded easement shall be
furnished to the Planning Department.
      (C)   Storm sewer laterals will be provided as directed by the City
Engineer for each (house) lot on a street having a curb and gutter.
      (D)   The design criteria for the drainage system shall be based on the
Ohio Department of Transportation design policy and the criteria established by
the City Engineer’s office. This criteria shall apply to development along
existing roads, as well as those requiring new roads to be constructed. This
criteria shall be available upon request from the City Engineer’s office.
         1.)   Road drainage system. The road storm drainage system shall serve
as the local drainage system. It shall be designed to carry roadway, adjacent
land and residential or commercial development storm water drainage, as
applicable. To prevent excessive pipe sizes, storm sewers shall drain into
natural waterways as soon as possible.
         2.)   Off-road drainage system. The design of the off-road drainage
system shall include the watershed affecting the development and shall be
extended to a watercourse or ditch adequate to receive the storm drainage.
      (E)   Storm water management requirements.
         1.)   The design and construction of storm water management facilities
shall require the review and approval of the City Engineer in accordance with
the technical criteria described in the County Storm Water Management Program
Guidelines as referred to by the city.
         2.)   Allowable types of storm water management facilities include,
but are not limited to:
            a.)    Retention ponds;
            b.)   Detention basins;
            c.)   Underground storage tanks;
            d.)   Rooftop storage areas;
            e.)   Parking lot storage areas;
            f.)   Infiltration/recharge ditches; and
            g.)   Swales/screening areas.
         3.)   All project sites or development areas required to implement
storm water management practices and facilities shall, at a minimum, limit the
peak rate of discharge from the project site or development area to the
downstream receiving watercourse as follows:
            a.)   Storm water management measures shall be required to maintain
the post development peak discharge at a level equal to or less than the
predevelopment peak discharge rate for a 24-hour duration, two-year frequency
storm event;
            b.)   Storm water management facilities shall be designed to
control the volume, timing and rate of flows; and
            c.)   Velocity reduction devices must be placed at all outlet
points, where necessary, to provide a nonerosive flow velocity to the receiving
watercourse. The City Engineer may waive these requirements if the
characteristics of the receiving watercourse, project site or development area
are such that this type of control would be contrary to accepted engineering
practice or detrimental to the environment.
      (F)   Wetlands. Wetlands will be identified on the improvement drawings.
If they are going to be changed in any manner, the developer must contact the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The County Soil and Water Conservation District
has a copy of the wetland resource maps for the county and the city. The County
Soil and Water Conservation District will point out such wetlands in its review
of the preliminary plan. If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit is required,
the permit number shall be shown on the final plat.
   (3)   Drainage system design and protection.
      (A)   Flood hazard. If any portion of the land within a subdivision is
subject to flooding (floodplains from the federal floodplain map), sewer
overflow, elevations or other hazards, due consideration shall be given to such
problems in the design of the subdivision, and the floodplain must be shown on
the improvement plans and plat.
      (B)   Dams or basins (embankments). Copies of detailed drawings of
proposed dams or basins and all calculations shall be submitted to the City
Engineer for approval. The developer or his or her engineer shall apply for a
permit from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, if
applicable, and any other applicable agencies.
      (C)   Protection of drainage systems.
         1.)   The subdivider shall adequately protect all ditches (roadways
and watercourses) to the satisfaction of the City Engineer as shown by
calculations made in accordance with the policy of the Ohio Department of
Transportation and the subdivision drainage criteria of the City Engineer.
         2.)   In all cases, any drainage facilities within a subdivision shall
be in a stable condition, free from either erosion or sedimentation, and/or
other debris. Any damage resulting from erosion, scour, silting of drainageways
or blockage of storm drainage systems on and off the development, caused by the
construction, shall be corrected at the developer’s expense.
      (D)   Drainage outlets. Where the City Engineer finds it necessary to
clean, alter or reconstruct a natural drainage course or storm sewer system
outside the development boundary to provide a storm water outlet, or to prevent
damage to other properties due to an increased or accelerated flow, the outlet
shall be provided and constructed at the expense of the developer and in
accordance with plans and specifications approved by the City Engineer.
      (E)   Drainage drawings. The developer’s engineer shall make a complete
study of the drainage area contributing to the development and submit copies of
all data and calculation sheets to the City Engineer for review and approval.
   (4)   Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a drainageway,
a storm sewer or drainage easement conforming substantially to the lines of
such drainageway shall be provided. The easement shall be a minimum of 20 feet,
or as the City Engineer and the PZC may require.
(Prior Code, § 1229.03) (Ord. 2009-21, passed 10-27-2009)
§ 157.133 LOT LAYOUT AND GENERAL SITE REGULATIONS.
   (1)   Blocks.
      (A)   Residential block lengths. The long dimension of a residential
block shall not exceed 1,500 feet.
      (B)   Commercial or industrial blocks. Blocks intended to be used for
commercial or industrial purposes shall be designed specifically for such uses
with adequate space set aside for off-street parking and loading facilities.
      (C)   Pedestrian walkways (crosswalks).
         1.)   Pedestrian walkways not less than ten feet wide, or of such
greater width as is deemed necessary by the Planning Department, shall be
required across streets where the Planning Department or the City Engineer
determines that pedestrian access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers,
transportation and other community facilities is necessary.
         2.)   Paving, fencing and other improvements may be required by the
PZC.
   (2)   Lots.
      (A)   Conformity to dimensional standards. The lot size, width and depth,
and the minimum building setback lines, shall, as a minimum, conform to this
Code.
      (B)   Access to public streets. The subdivision of land, whether as a
major or minor subdivision, shall provide each lot with 85 feet of continuous
frontage on a dedicated street. This standard may be reduced to 50 feet by the
PZC for lots fronting on a permanent cul-de-sac or other curved street
frontages (e.g., knuckles).
      (C)   Double frontage lots.
         1.)   Lots shall be laid out so that there are no double frontages,
except:
            a.)   Where extreme conditions in elevation prevent access to the
lot from one of the streets; or
            b.)   Where it is necessary to separate residential lots from major
arterial thoroughfares.
         2.)   Where double frontage lots are created adjacent to major
arterial thoroughfares, a reserve strip along the major arterial thoroughfares
shall be deeded to the City Council, as approved by the Mayor, by resolution or
ordinance pursuant to the City Charter. The plat shall state that there shall
be no right of access across such reserve strip. The Planning Department may
require that a decorative six-foot high solid board fence or masonry fence be
constructed or that a ten-foot wide planting screen be provided.
      (D)   Construction on two or more lots. When a building is proposed to be
constructed on two or more adjacent recorded lots or tracts of land, such lots
shall be combined and the new legal description or replat document depicting
one lot shall be recorded.
      (E)   Access to public thoroughfares. No building shall be erected on a
lot which does not abut on at least one public thoroughfare, or at least one
private road built in accordance with public thoroughfare standards and
specifications, except upon presentation to Council of evidence of the
existence of a cash bond sufficient to ensure construction of said thoroughfare
or private road.
      (F)   Visual obstructions. On a corner lot, no visual obstruction of
living or nonliving material in excess of two feet in height is permitted
within a 30-foot radius from the intersection of the road rights-of-way.
   (3)   Lot lines. Lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial
to street lines. Lot lines should follow municipal, township and county
boundary lines rather than cross them.
   (4)   Lot depth. No lot depth shall exceed four and one-half times the lot
width or be less than one and one-half times the lot width at the minimum
building setback line, unless otherwise exempted. The lot width shall be
measured at the minimum building setback line.
   (5)   Public facilities and open space.
      (A)   Public facilities. The design of subdivisions should provide for
parks, playgrounds or other sites for public use as required by the PZC. There
shall be a time period of not more than six months during which the developer
and public agency can agree upon compensation to the developer and the quantity
of property needed for a public facility. If an agreement is not reached within
this six-month period, the property will be returned to its original design. If
there is an adopted land use and thoroughfare or comprehensive plan for the
area, such public facilities shall conform to such plan.
      (B)   Natural features. The developer is encouraged to give consideration
to preserving outstanding natural features, such as scenic spots, water bodies
or exceptionally fine groves of trees.
   (6)   Easements. Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines
shall be provided for utilities where necessary and shall be of such widths as
may be reasonably necessary for the utilities using the easement. It shall be
the subdivider or developer’s responsibility to determine appropriate easement
widths as required by the utility company.
(Prior Code, § 1229.04) (Ord. 2009-21, passed 10-27-2009)
§ 157.134 PARKING, LOADING AND STACKING REGULATIONS.
   (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to prevent and alleviate the
congestion of public streets, to minimize the detrimental effects of vehicular
use areas on adjacent properties, and to promote the safety and welfare of the
public by establishing minimum requirements for parking and loading areas.
   (2)   Applicability. Off-street parking, loading and stacking facilities
shall be provided in conformity with this section as a condition precedent to
occupancy of a residential, business, industrial or recreational use, and at
any time a building, structure or use of land is enlarged, expanded or
increased in capacity or use.
   (3)   Rules for computations. The following rules shall apply when computing
parking, loading or stacking spaces.
      (A)   On-street parking. On-street parking spaces shall not be counted
toward off-street parking space requirements.
      (B)   Multiple uses. Unless otherwise noted or approved as part of a
shared parking agreement, off-street parking areas serving more than one use
shall provide parking in an amount equal to the combined total of the
requirements for each use.
      (C)   Fractions. When a measurement of the number of required spaces
results in a fractional number, any fraction of one-half or less shall be
rounded down to the next lower whole number and any fraction of more than one-
half shall be rounded up to the next higher whole number.
      (D)   Area measurements.
         1.)   Unless otherwise specifically noted, all square footage-based
standards shall be computed based on gross floor area of all floors in a
nonresidential building.
         2.)   Up to 20% of the total gross floor area may be excluded from the
calculation if the floor area is used for storage, packaging of merchandise or
maintenance.
      (E)   Occupancy or capacity based standards.
         1.)   For the purpose of computing requirements based on employees,
students, residents, or occupants, calculations shall be based on the largest
number of persons working on a single shift, the maximum enrollment, or the
maximum fire-rated capacity, whichever is applicable, and whichever results in
a greater number of spaces.
         2.)   In hospitals, bassinets shall not be counted as beds.
         3.)   In the case of benches, pews and similar seating accommodations,
each 18 inches thereof shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of
determining applicable requirements.
      (F)   Unlisted uses.
         1.)   Upon receiving an application for a use not specifically listed
in the schedules below, the Planning Department shall apply the standard
specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use in
regards to use, size and intensity of use.
         2.)   If the Planning Department determines that there is no listed
use similar to the proposed use, intensity or size, they may refer to the
estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of
Traffic Engineers (ITE).
   (4)   Parking space requirements.
      (A)   
Table 157.134-1  defines the number of parking spaces required for each use
within the city.
      (B)   A minimum of five spaces is required for any use other than a
single-family dwelling or two-family dwelling, unless approved as a conditional
use pursuant to §
157.052.
      (C)    Whenever the parking requirements of
Table 157.134-1 can be shown by the applicant to result in an excessive number
of parking spaces and that a lesser number of spaces is appropriate and
consistent with this Code, the PZC may approve a reduction in required spaces.

      (C)   Design and layout.
         1.)   Drive-up facilities shall be located on that part of a site
which is most distant from or most screened from existing or planned abutting
sensitive uses (such as residences or offices) on abutting properties, except
where existing uses are nonconforming. Where site conditions necessitate
locating a drive-up facility near to a sensitive use, the area between the uses
shall be heavily screened as directed by the PZC.
         2.)   Drive-up facilities, their stacking areas and routes of access
shall be located so as to not interfere with vehicles or pedestrian movement on
the public street or within the site. Stacking areas for drive-up facilities
shall not be the sole or primary site egress route. Stacking areas shall not
utilize parking or aisles required for access to parking.
         3.)   Drive-up facilities which utilize microphones or other audible
signals shall be designed to minimize sound impacts upon abutting uses. Hours
of operation shall be as approved by the PZC.
         4.)   Stacking spaces shall be a minimum of ten feet by 20 feet in
size.
         5.)   Stacking spaces may not impede on- or off-site traffic movements
or movements in or out of off-street parking spaces.
         6.)   Stacking spaces shall be separated from other internal driveways
by surface markings. Raised medians may be required where deemed necessary by
the PZC for the purpose of traffic movement and safety.

      (C)   General design standards. Every loading space shall be designed,
constructed and maintained in accordance with the standards and requirements
set forth below.
         1.)   Loading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the building
or structure to which they are accessory. No loading space shall be located in
any required front yard, nor shall it permit any vehicle to extend into any
front yard or across any lot lines of a more restrictive district while the
vehicle is being loaded or unloaded.
         2.)   Loading facilities for receipt or shipping of equipment,
material or waste shall be located on rear or side facades of a building which
are not visible from a public street or from an existing or planned residential
area.
         3.)   No required loading space shall be less than 12 feet in width or
40 feet in length or have a vertical clearance of less than 14 feet.
         4.)   Loading spaces shall be designed and arranged to provide access
to a street or alley in a manner that will create the least possible
interference with traffic movement and parking lot circulation. The Zoning
Division shall approve access to and from loading spaces.
         5.)   Loading areas shall not create additional curb cuts, unless
approved by the PZC.
         6.)   All loading areas shall be clearly marked and distinguishable
from parking spaces.
         7.)   No part of any truck or van that is being loaded or unloaded may
extend into the right-of-way of a public thoroughfare.
         8.)   Loading spaces shall be designed with sufficient apron area to
accommodate truck-turning movements and to prevent backing of trucks onto any
street right-of-way.
   (7)   Design of vehicular use areas. All vehicular use areas, including off-
street parking, loading and stacking areas, shall meet the following
provisions, unless otherwise provided for in this Code.
      (A)   General guidelines for vehicular use areas.
         1.)   Parking facilities shall be designed for storage of customer and
employee vehicles in a manner suited to the nature of the use and its vehicular
impacts, including the number and frequency of visits, length of visits and
vehicle types.
         2.)   Parking facilities shall be designed with adequate locations for
storage of plowed snow.
         3.)   Parking facilities shall be designed to facilitate cleaning of
pavement and to minimize locations where litter and other waste collects.
         4.)   Parking facilities shall be designed to comply with all specific
standards and guidelines of this Code, but applicants shall seek to minimize
the amount of pavement required to comply, and no provision of this Code shall
be interpreted to require the construction of paved areas not deemed necessary
by the PZC for the functioning of the use and its parking facility.
         5.)   Parking facilities shall be equipped with waste containers
sufficient in location, type and volume for customer use.
         6.)   Parking and loading areas shall be lighted to allow for safe
movement of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
         7.)   Where parking is not provided near the main entrance of a
building, space(s) shall be provided for drop-off/pick-up of a person with
mobility limitations. Special attention to this need shall be given where
frequent drop-offs/pick-ups are likely, such as medical facilities and
restaurants. Such drop-off/pick-up sites may be located in drives; provided
that they do not unduly interfere with movement into or out of the site from
the street.
         8.)   Buildings and uses which involve frequent loading of bulky
merchandise by customers (for example, grocery stores or building supply
stores), shall provide adequate drive-up loading spaces and corrals for the
collection of any shopping carts. The location and design of cart corrals shall
be as approved by the PZC.
         9.)   Site elements shall be designed to provide safe and speedy
access for police, fire and emergency medical service.
      (B)   Location and setback requirements.
         1.)   Vehicular use areas shall be located on the same lot as the
principal use they serve, unless the spaces meet the requirements of division
(8)(C) below.
         2.)   Vehicular use areas shall be located, to the maximum extent
feasible, in the rear or on the side of buildings.
         3.)   Location of off-street residential parking spaces.
            a.)   For any residential use or parcel, off-street parking shall
be prohibited in the front yard with the exception of driveways providing
access from the street to the parking area.
            b.)   Within ten feet of the right-of-way, the maximum width of the
driveway for a single-family or two-family use shall be 24 feet.
         4.)   No part of a vehicular use area designed for five vehicles or
more shall be closer than five feet from the side and rear lot line of any lot
in a nonresidential district, unless it is adjacent to a residential district
where it shall be set back 50 feet from the property line adjacent to the
residential district. All setback areas shall be landscaped with grass and
planting areas and shall be well maintained.
         5.)   Vehicular use areas shall be set back from the edge of buildings
to provide for sidewalk and landscape treatments in front of the building.
         6.)   There shall be a minimum ten-foot front yard buffer area
beginning at the right-of-way line of any street. The area within such buffer
yard shall be landscaped in accordance with §
157.136(6), and maintained in good condition.
         7.)   All vehicular use areas for five vehicles or more shall be
screened on any side that adjoins or faces a property in any residential
district. Such screening shall consist of a solid masonry wall or solid fence
of not less than four and not more than six feet in height. A tight screen of
hardy evergreen shrubbery of not less than four feet in height may be used as
an alternative to the solid masonry wall or solid fence. For uses or properties
subject to §
157.136, the more restrictive landscaping, screening or buffering shall apply.
         8.)   No entrance to or exit from a vehicular use area designed for
five vehicles or more shall be closer than 50 feet to the right-of-way line of
intersecting public streets or signalized intersection.  See Figure 157.134-2 .

   Figure 157.134-2 : Illustration of vehicular use access.
      (C)   Access.
         1.)   Adequate access to a public street, easement or shared access to
an adjacent property shall be provided for each parking space with a driveway
width of at least 24 feet, but no wider than 40 feet, at the property line for
all multi-family dwellings and nonresidential uses. See
Figure
157.134-2 .
         2.)   All parking spaces shall be entered and exited along parking
aisles arranged perpendicular to access drives or aisles to the maximum extent
feasible. Parking spaces shall not be located along entry drives within 30 feet
of the right-of-way (see
Figure 157.134-3 ). This distance may be reduced to ten feet for access from a
secondary street when the lot is a corner lot with access to two public
streets.

   Figure 157.134-3 : Ingress and egress into parking areas.
         3.)   Driveways shall be located so loading and unloading activities
will not hinder vehicular ingress and egress.
         4.)   To the maximum extent feasible, all uses shall provide paved,
concrete or paved pedestrian linkages to existing trail systems, parks,
schools, adjacent developments and mass transit stations or stops. Such
pedestrian linkages shall be a minimum of five feet in width.
         5.)   To the maximum extent feasible, provisions for primary access
along secondary streets shall be provided to minimize traffic congestion on
primary arterial streets.
         6.)   Lots having 250 feet or less of public street frontage shall be
permitted one, two-way access drive or a pair of one-way drives.
         7.)   Lots having more than 250 feet of public street frontage shall
be permitted two, two-way access drives or a pair of one-way drives. The
minimum spacing shall be determined by the layout of the project, subject to
site plan review.
         8.)   Shared access may be provided and is encouraged; provided that a
legal shared access agreement is submitted and approved by the Law Director
that provides for the rights of the respective parties to use the shared access
drives. This agreement shall include provisions, evidence of deed restrictions
or other recorded covenants that ensure that the access will be properly
maintained during the life of the development.
      (D)   Design standards.
         1.)   Minimum size. The minimum size of a parking space may be altered
based on aisle width and angle of parking. Parking stalls shall conform to the
minimum standards set forth in
Table 157.134-4 and
Figure 157.134-4.
         2.)   Alternative design. Parking stalls may be designed at 10' in
width x 18' in length. Use of this alternative design shall be for the purpose
of conserving hard surface area, not to maximize the number of parking stalls
on a site and is permitted with the following conditions.
            a.)   Green space, in addition to the minimum site requirement,
shall be provided on the site in the amount of 20 square feet per 10' x 18'
parking stall proposed. This additional amount of green space is the difference
in area between 10' x 20' and 10' x 18' parking stalls. The number of 10' x 18'
stalls proposed shall not exceed the maximum number of 10' x 20' stalls that
would meet the impervious surface area ratio of the site.
            b.)   Requests for variances shall not be permitted for impervious
surface area ratio if 10' x 18' parking stalls are proposed.
            c.)     The 10' x 18' stall size shall apply to all parking
configurations shown in
Table 157.134-4, with the exception of parallel parking and shall meet all
applicable provisions of this code.
            d.)   Requests for the use of any parking stall that is less than
ten feet in width shall require a variance and the provision of additional on-
site green space. The required amount of such green space shall be determined
by taking the difference in land area of the proposed stall and a standard 10'
x 20' (200 square feet) stall. No variances shall be permitted for impervious
surface area ratio when any stall less than ten feet in width is proposed.

         3.)   Maneuverability areas. The following provisions shall be
followed to maintain efficient maneuverability.
            a.)   Turn around area. Where more than three parking spaces are
served by a single driveway, a turnaround area shall be provided, or other
provisions made, to permit cars to exit the parking lot without backing onto
any street or sidewalk. See maneuvering aisle widths in
Table 157.134-4 and
Figure 157.134-4.
            b.)   Back-up area. Each parking space shall be provided with a
sufficient back-up area so as to permit egress in one maneuver, consisting of
one backward and forward movement. See maneuvering aisle widths in
Table 157.134-4 and
Figure 157.134-4.
         4.)   Surface.
            a.)   All vehicular use areas shall be constructed of hard surfaced
bituminous concrete or asphalt, free from dust and so drained that surface
waters therefrom are not permitted to discharge over or onto public sidewalks,
roadways or other premises.

               ii.)   Pavers that allow for grass to grow through them may be
permitted as part of a permitted landbanked parking area as described in
division (8)(A) of this section.
         5.)   Continuous curbs.
            a.)    Continuous curbs shall be made of asphalt, concrete, stone
or other similar material and shall have a minimum height of six inches and a
minimum width of six inches. They shall form a noninterrupted edge around all
landscaped areas adjacent to parking and maneuverability areas that are not
protected by wheel stops. Exceptions may be made where a curb cut provides for
drainage or storm water management. See
Figure 157.134-5.
            b.)   Continuous curbs shall be required along all parking areas
facing a street right-of-way.
            c.)   Continuous curbs shall be required to surround parking areas
in all business districts for parking lots with 20 or more parking spaces.
            d.)   Wheel stops shall not be used when a continuous curb is
provided.

   See Figure 157.134-6: Wheel stop placement.
         7.)   Placement. Wheel stops and/or continuous curbs shall be located
a minimum of four feet from any structures, buildings, walls or plant material
to prevent a vehicle from driving onto the landscaped area or hitting any
structure or plant material at the edge of a parking area with the exception of
where the area is an open grass area with no landscaping. See See
Figure 157.134-5.
         8.)   Striping.
            a.)   The individual parking spaces (stalls) shall be striped
according to the approved layout of the parking area.
            b.)   Striping shall be maintained in a clearly visible condition.
      (E)   Parking requirements for physically disabled. Applicants shall
provide parking spaces for the physically disabled as required by the Ohio
Basic Building Code and shall include all necessary markings, striping, and
signage.
      (F)   Walkway connections to public sidewalks.
         1.)   Where a sidewalk exists in a public right-of-way adjacent to the
site, or is required to be constructed as part of the development approval, a
pedestrian connection shall be constructed from the building to the sidewalk.
         2.)   The pedestrian connections shall be constructed of asphalt,
concrete or of hard surface pavers.
         3.)   The pedestrian connection may be created as part of a driveway;
provided that it is delineated with a minimum of a painted line and the portion
utilized for vehicular traffic is not reduced from the minimum width
requirements.
         4.)   The pedestrian connection shall have a minimum width of three
feet.
      (G)   Fire Code. All parking and loading plans shall conform to all
requirements set forth in the Fire Code as adopted by the city and as approved
by the Fire Division.
      (H)   Maintenance of vehicular use areas. All vehicular use areas shall
be provided with satisfactory access to a street, easement, shared access road
or alley by means of a solid and dust free driveway that meets the requirements
of this section. All vehicular use areas shall be developed and maintained in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (8)   Alternative parking. The following are permitted methods of
accommodating parking as an alternative to constructing the required number of
parking spaces on an individual lot.
      (A)   Landbanked parking. A portion of the required parking spaces may
remain landscaped and unpaved or paved with pervious pavers; provided that the
parking and unpaved areas complies with the following standards and is
authorized by the PZC. See
Figure 157.134-7.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/516804923e8f843b473c8b55c5248022de9076cd/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4528.png]
 
   Figure 157.134-7: Example of landbanked parking.
         1.)   The site plan shall denote the location and layout of that
portion of the parking area that currently is deemed unrequired. The plan shall
indicate that the landbanked parking spaces will be constructed according to
this Code in the event that the Planning Department determines at any time that
all or any portion of this parking is necessary.
         2.)   At no time shall any portion of the required parking area that
is so designated for future construction be used for the construction of any
structure or paved surface with the exception that pervious pavers may be used
to provide temporary parking; provided that the pavers allow for grass and
other vegetation to grow through the material.
         3.)   At no time shall any portion of the required parking or loading
that is so designated for future construction as provided herein be counted as
open space or other nonpaved areas required by other provisions of this Code.
         4.)   The owner shall initiate construction of the approved future
parking area(s), as identified on the approved site plan, within three months
of the receipt of a certified letter or a letter through normal postal service
(in the event that the certified letter is not accepted) sent to the owner of
record from the Planning Department identifying that such parking is determined
to be necessary.
      (B)   Shared parking. A portion of the required parking spaces may be
located on an adjacent property if the parking area complies with the following
standards and is authorized by the PZC.
         1.)   Shared parking is encouraged and permitted if the multiple uses
that the shared parking will benefit can cooperatively establish and operate
the facilities.
         2.)   Shared parking shall not account for more than 25% of the
required parking spaces as established in
Table 157.134-1 .
         3.)   The applicant shall have the burden of proof for reduction of
the total number of parking spaces and shall document and submit information
substantiating their request. Shared parking may be approved if:
            a.)   A sufficient number of spaces are provided to meet the
highest demand of the participating uses;
            b.)   The uses are located adjacent to each other;
            c.)   Evidence has been submitted by the parties operating the
shared parking facility, to the satisfaction of the Zoning Division,
documenting the nature of uses and the times when the individual uses will
operate so as to demonstrate the lack of potential conflict between them;
            d.)   The shared parking spaces will not be located in excess of
200 feet from the uses they are intended to serve;
            e.)   A legal shared parking agreement is submitted and approved by
the Law Director which provides for the rights of the respective parties to use
the shared parking areas in a manner adequate to accommodate multiple users or
that parking spaces will be shared at specific times of the day (i.e., one
activity uses the spaces during day time hours and another activity uses the
spaces during evening hours). This agreement shall include provisions, evidence
of deed restrictions or other recorded covenants that ensure that the spaces
will be properly maintained during the life of the development.
            f.)   The approved shared parking agreement shall be filed with the
application for a zoning permit and shall be filed with the County Fiscal
Officer and recorded in a manner as to encumber all properties involved in the
shared parking agreement; and
            g.)   No zoning permit will be issued until proof of recordation of
the agreement is provided to the Zoning Division.
      (C)   Off-site parking. Off-site parking is not encouraged, however, a
portion of the required parking spaces may be located on a separate lot from
the lot on which the principal use is located if the off-site parking complies
with the following standards and is authorized by the PZC.
         1.)   Off-site parking shall be reviewed as a conditional use by the
PZC.
         2.)   Off-site parking shall not be used to satisfy the off-street
parking standards for residential uses, hospitals, bars (if not incidental to a
restaurant) or convenience stores and other convenience-oriented uses. Required
parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities shall not be located in
an off-site parking facility.
         3.)   No off-site parking space shall be located more than 500 feet
from the primary entrance of the use served, measured along the shortest legal,
practical walking route. This route may include crossing a right-of-way;
provided it uses a legal crosswalk.
         4.)   Off-site parking shall not be permitted on a vacant lot in a
residential zoning district unless permitted by the PZC.
         5.)   The off-site parking that is proposed to be used shall exist
prior to the agreement and shall be associated with an existing use.
         6.)   Off-site parking areas shall adhere to the regulations of the
same or a more intensive zoning classification than that required for the use
served.
         7.)   In the event that an off-site parking area is not under the same
ownership as the principal use served, a written off-site parking agreement
shall be required.
         8.)   An off-site parking agreement shall be submitted and approved as
to form by the Law Director. This agreement shall include provisions, evidence
of deed restrictions or other recorded covenants that ensure that the spaces
will be properly maintained during the life of the development.
         9.)   The off-site parking agreement approved by the Law Director
shall be filed with the application for a zoning permit and shall be recorded
as a deed restriction or covenant in a manner as to encumber all properties
involved in the off-site parking agreement.
         10.)   Final inspection to authorize occupancy shall not be granted
until proof of recordation of the agreement is provided to the Zoning Division.
         11.)   Off-site parking shall be used and maintained solely for
parking as long as the use, as recorded and approved, exists. The off-site
parking agreement may be terminated when the additional site is no longer
necessary, there is a change of use or the approved conditions are no longer
applicable.
   (9)   Storage of trailers, recreational vehicles, campers and boats. The
following shall be applicable in all zoning districts, unless approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission as an approved use for outdoor storage under §
157.086(11) and
Table 157.087-1.
      (A)   Trailers (not to include utility trailers, which may be stored in
the driveway of a residence), recreational vehicles, campers and boats may be
stored on private property; provided that such vehicle is located in the rear
and/or side yard no less than ten feet from the property line on a stable
surface (stable defined as concrete, asphalt, permeable or nonpermeable pavers,
or a minimum of three inches of gravel). Vehicles shall not be connected to any
electrical (except during periods of loading and unloading as permitted in
division (9)(F) of this section), water, gas (or fuel source) or sanitary
sewer, and shall not be resided within.
      (B)   Storage/parking of utility trailers, recreational vehicles, campers
and boats on corner lots or double frontage lots shall comply with the minimum
building setback from all property lines. Corner or double frontage lots are
considered to have two front building setback lines.
      (C)   Trailers, recreational vehicles, campers and boats shall not be
used as a dwelling, office or other business, or for storage of any material,
except as may be permitted per code as a temporary construction trailer.
      (D)   In a residential district, no more than one utility trailer,
recreational vehicle, camper or boat exceeding 20 feet in length shall be
stored outdoors on a lot.
      (E)   The trailer, utility trailer, recreational vehicle, camper or boat
must be in a condition such that it can be used for its intended purpose, and
shall be currently licensed and registered with the state and shall be
registered in the name of the property owner and/or tenant of the parcel on
which the vehicle is parked/stored.
      (F)   One trailer, recreational vehicle, camper or boat may be parked in
a driveway area for the purpose of loading/unloading for a period of not more
than 72 consecutive hours in any consecutive 30-day period.
   (10)   Commercial vehicles in residential districts. No commercial vehicle
shall be permitted on a lot in any residential district, except that an
occupant shall be permitted to park one truck not exceeding three-fourths of a
ton capacity that is used in connection with said occupant’s livelihood;
provided that such truck is wholly enclosed within a garage.
(Prior Code, § 1229.05) (Ord. 2009-21, passed 10-27-2009; Ord. 2013-02, passed
2-26-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-22-2021; Ord. 2022-02, passed 3-8-2022; Ord.

§ 157.135 SIGNS.
   (1)   Purpose.
      (A)   The purpose of this section is to promote the general health,
safety and welfare of the residents of the city, and maintain high property
values by:
         1.)   Providing reasonable, yet appropriate, conditions for
identifying businesses or services rendered in nonresidential zoning districts;
         2.)   Controlling the size, location and design of permanent signs so
that the appearance of such signs will be aesthetically harmonious with their
surroundings;
         3.)   Eliminating any conflict that would be hazardous between
business or identification signs and traffic-control signs and devices;
         4.)   Ensuring that signs are located and designed to maintain a safe
and orderly pedestrian and vehicular environment; and
         5.)   Reducing sign clutter.
      (B)   In establishing the objectives in division (1)(A) of this section,
the city has determined that, without adequate regulation and design standards,
signs are a nuisance. The number of signs in the city is excessive and unduly
distracting to motorists and pedestrians, creates a traffic hazard and, in some
places, reduces the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public. As the
appearance of the city is marred by the excessive number, oversized and poorly
designed signs, both business and residential property values are adversely
affected. Therefore, the number of such distracting signs ought to be reduced
and signs permitted shall conform to the standards of this Code in order to
reduce these effects. All signs not conforming with the provisions of this
section are declared a nuisance. It is further declared that the regulations
contained in this section are the minimum regulations necessary to abate the
nuisance(s) and to achieve the purposes of this Code.
   (2)   Applicability. A zoning permit is required to erect any sign (except
as otherwise provided in this division (2)), and no permit shall be issued
until such signs have been reviewed according to the following.
      (A)   The PZC shall have the responsibility to review and make decisions
on freestanding signs.
      (B)   The Zoning Division shall have the responsibility to review and
make decisions on attached signs, directional signs and temporary signs.
      (C)   The Zoning Division shall authorize the issuance of a permit for
such sign when the Zoning Division determines that the sign complies with all
provisions of this section. The Zoning Division may refer the decision on any
of the above signs to the PZC for consideration if the Zoning Division
determines that the sign, as proposed, is more appropriately the responsibility
of the PZC.
      (D)   For multi-tenant buildings in business or industrial districts, and
for individual buildings located in business and industrial parks, the PZC may
approve with the development plans for new buildings, or at the time a specific
sign request is made for a tenant identification sign in an existing building,
basic sign parameters as to the location, size and style of each tenant sign,
and authorize the Zoning Division to specifically approve the subsequent
individual tenant signs upon specific application when such proposed signs
comply with the parameters established by this Code.
   (3)   Calculating sign area and height.
      (A)   Sign area.
         1.)   For a sign that is framed, outlined, painted and otherwise
prepared and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area
dimensions shall include the entire portion within such background or frame.
         2.)   For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures or elements
on a wall or similar surface, or an irregularly shaped freestanding sign, the
area of the sign shall encompass a regular geometric shape, or a combination of
regular geometric shapes, which forms or approximates the perimeter of all the
elements in the display. When separate elements are organized to form a single
sign, but the elements are separated by open space, the area shall be
calculated by determining the geometric form, or combination of forms, which
comprises all the display area, including the space between the elements.
         3.)   The sign area shall include the frame, but shall not include the
pole or other structural support, unless such pole or structural support is
illuminated or otherwise so designated to constitute a display surface or
device.
      (B)   Clearance from electrical lines. Signs shall maintain a minimum
horizontal clearance of eight feet in addition to the fall radius and a
vertical clearance of at least eight feet from electrical lines and in
accordance with the provisions of the National Electrical Code, as revised.

ten feet in height from the average grade, it has identical display surfaces in
terms of size, color and copy, and its display surfaces do not exceed a 90-
degree angle to each other.
      (D)   Height for freestanding signs. The height of a sign shall be
measured from the average grade under the sign to the top of the highest
element of the sign or support structure.
      (E)   Determination of building and tenant frontage. The length of the
building or unit of the building which faces the principal street, or the
length of the wall of the building or unit which contains the main entrance to
the uses therein, shall be considered the building frontage. In the case of an
irregular wall surface, a straight line extended along such wall surface shall
be used to measure the length. Only one exterior wall of any business shall be
considered its frontage. The portion of a building which is owned or leased by
a single tenant shall be considered a building unit. The length of a unit is
that portion of the building so occupied by a single activity and calculated
proportionally in the same manner as the building frontage.
   (4)   General sign standards. In addition to ensuring compliance with the
numerical standards of this section, the PZC, when approving signs, shall
consider the proposed general design, arrangement, texture, material, colors,
lighting, placement and appropriateness of the proposed sign in relationship to
other signs and other structures, both on the premises and in the surrounding
area, and approve only signs which are consistent with the intent, purposes,
standards and criteria of this section. Specific standards for determining the

      (F)   Signs in the right-of-way; obstructing vision or traffic.
         1.)   No signs shall be placed in any public right-of-way, except
publicly-owned signs, such as traffic-control signs, city identification signs
and directional signage as permitted in this section.
         2.)   No sign or other advertising structure as regulated by this
section shall be erected:

color, it may interfere with traffic, obstruct the view of traffic or be
confused with the use of words, such as stop, danger or any other word, phrase,
symbol or character in such a manner as to interfere with, mislead or confuse
traffic.
      (G)   Illumination. The light from any illuminated sign or from any light

material shall not be allowed when used to satisfy the screening requirements
of this section.
            b.)   Walls and fences shall be designed to orient the best, or
most aesthetic side, away from the subject lot so the best side faces the
adjacent lots.
         2.)   Plants. Plant materials used in conformance with these
provisions shall conform to the American Association of Nurserymen and shall
have passed any inspection required under state regulations. Trees shall be
balled and burlapped or in containers. Shrubs, vines and ground covers can be
plants as bare root, as well as balled and burlapped or from containers.
            a.)   Deciduous trees. Deciduous trees shall have a minimum caliper
of at least two and one- half inches DBH conforming to acceptable nursery
industry procedures at the time of planting. If deciduous trees are to be used
for screening purposes, additional materials listed in this section shall be
used to create a dense screen.
            b.)   Evergreen trees. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of six
feet in height at the time of planting. When used for screening, evergreen
plantings shall be planted at a maximum distance of 15 feet on center to
provide an effective screen.
            c.)   Ornamental trees. Ornamental trees shall have a minimum
height of five feet or a minimum caliper of at least two and one-half inches
DBH conforming to acceptable nursery industry procedures at the time of
planting.
            d.)   Shrubs and hedges. Shrubs and hedges shall be at least 36
inches in height at the time of planting. All shrubs and hedges shall be

foot on center to provide 75% complete coverage after two growing seasons.
               ii.)   Once the minimum landscape requirements have been met,
any size plant may be installed on a lot to supplement the minimum
requirements.
            f.)   Earth mounds. Earth mounds may be used as a screening
requirement, however, differences in natural elevation between areas requiring
a screen does not constitute an earth mound. Earth mounds shall be constructed
of earthen materials and shall conform to the following:
               i.)   Earth mound shall conform with the grading requirements of
the City Engineer;
               ii.)   The maximum side slope shall be three horizontal to one
vertical (3:1) and the design shall be reviewed by the Zoning Division to
ensure that proper erosion control and prevention practices are utilized;
               iii.)   Berms and earth forms shall be designed with physical
variations in height and alignment throughout its length;
               iv.)   Landscaping plant materials may be installed on berms and
earth mounds and shall be arranged in an irregular pattern to accentuate the
physical variation and achieve a natural appearance;
               v.)   Berms and earth mounds shall be located and designed to
minimize the disturbance of existing trees located on the site or adjacent
thereto;
               vi.)   Adequate ground cover shall be used and maintained to
prevent erosion of the earth mound; and
                   vii.)   No mound wastewater treatment system or other
similar on-site wastewater treatment system shall count toward the screening
requirement.
      (F)   Easements. Nothing shall be planted or installed within any
underground or overhead utility, drainage or gas easement without the consent
of the owner of the easement.
   (4)   Screening between districts.
      (A)   Screening types. The following screening types are hereby
established.
         1.)   Type A screen. Type A screens are intended to provide visual
screening. A Type A screen is a solid fence or wall with a minimum height of
six feet. A fence or wall may be used to create the opaque screen; provided
that at least 50% of the length of the fence or wall along each property line
is landscaped on the outside of the fence or wall, or evergreens are used in
lieu of 50% of the fence or wall. The spacing of the landscaping must comply
with division (4)(C) of this section. All fencing and walls shall be set back
15 feet from the lot line separating the less restrictive zoning district to
allow for maintenance of the applicable yard.
         2.)   Type B screen. Type B screens are intended to provide partial
visual screening and to provide aesthetically pleasing delineation of
boundaries between zoning districts. A Type B screen is a densely planted
screen which need not be opaque for its entire length. At least 50% of the
length of the screen along each property line must be opaque. The remaining 50%
of the length of the screen along each property line may contain any
combination of small shrubs or larger plants that comply with division (4)(C)
of this section. A mound built in accordance with division (3)(E) of this
section may be used instead of shrubs.
         3.)   Type C screen. A Type C screen is intended to separate
functions, such as streets, sidewalks and parking; to provide pleasing visual
effects; and to provide areas to serve environmental functions. A Type C screen
is a less dense planting than Type A or Type B and may include deciduous
plants. At least 50% of the length of the screen must be planted with large or
medium trees and the remaining 50% of the screen length may be any combination
of shrubs, excluding dwarf shrubs, that will comply with division (4)(C) of
this section. A mound built in accordance with division (3)(E) of this section
may be used instead of shrubs.
      (B)   Screening requirements. Screening between zoning districts is
required in accordance with
Table 157.136-1. When more than one zoning abuts the property to be landscaped,
the more restrictive of the screen types shall apply.

      (C)   Screening standards.
         1.)   When fences or walls are used to fulfill requirements for Type
A, B or C screens, the maximum length of each continuous fence or wall segment
without landscaping shall be 50 feet. Longer segments must be provided with
landscaping in accordance with this section along the outside of a wall or
fence, or planting meeting the screen type requirements in lieu of a fence or
wall segment.
         2.)   Dwarf shrubs and ground cover may be planted on the outside of a
fence or wall, but these will not count toward the screening requirement.
         3.)   If evergreens are used to fulfill the requirements for an opaque
screen, total opacity and a minimum height of six feet shall be required within
three years after issuance of a use and occupancy permit. If the planting does
not meet these requirements within three years, additional plantings or a fence
or wall meeting these requirements shall be constructed and landscaped as
required under this section.
         4.)   Each 50 linear-foot segment of screening, including plantings on
the outside of a wall or fence as described in this section, shall contain
landscaping equivalent to two large trees. For purposes of this section, the
following are considered equivalent and may be used in any combination which
achieves at least the minimum amount required:
            a.)   Two large trees with a maturity height of 40 feet or taller;
            b.)   Three medium or small trees with a maturity height of less
than 40 feet;
            c.)   Ten large shrubs with a maturity height of one foot or
larger; or
            d.)   Fifteen medium or small shrubs with a maturity height of less
than one foot.
         5.)   Berms or mounds may be used to fulfill screening requirements;
provided they meet the requirements of division (3)(E) of this section.
         6.)   No proposed building addition, structure, merchandise display,
parking area or any similar feature shall be located in front of or within a
required screen. Notwithstanding the above, a driveway entrance may cross a
required screen.
         7.)   Required screens must be installed on the subject property,
within the required setback. The minimum width of the screened area is ten
feet. The soil in each screen area must be covered by trees, shrubs, grass,
ground cover, landscape gravel or mulch.
         8.)   All screening shall be free of advertising or other signs,
except for directional signs and other signs for the efficient flow of
vehicles.
         9.)   Whenever, because of unusual size, topography, shape of the
property, location of the property or other unusual conditions, the strict
application of the requirements of this division would result in significant
degradation of the site or adjacent properties, the requirement may be varied
or waived by the PZC; provided that such variance or waiver shall not be
detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, or to the orderly
development of the area.
   (5)   Landscaping of vehicular use areas. All development subject to site
plan review shall include the following required landscaping for parking lots.
      (A)   Minimum interior landscaping requirements. For parking areas
designed to accommodate 20 or more vehicles, a minimum of 5% of the land area
within the parking area shall be appropriately designed with landscaped areas
and planted islands in accordance with this section.
      (B)   Landscape island locations.
         1.)   Landscape islands shall be located at the end of each parking
row with a minimum size of 140 square feet for single loaded parking rows and a
minimum size of 280 square feet for double loaded rows.
         2.)   The landscaped islands should be designed, to the maximum extent
feasible, to accommodate storm water runoff. The use of porous pavement and/or
specially designed brick or block is encouraged to increase on-site water
detention for plant material and ground water supplies and to reduce problems
associated with runoff.
      (C)   Planting requirements.
         1.)   Plantings for interior landscaping shall be provided at a rate
of two trees and six shrubs per 15 parking spaces or fraction thereof.
         2.)   Each individual landscaped island shall include a minimum of one
tree and two shrubs.
         3.)   The trees and shrubs shall be distributed throughout the parking
lot islands to decrease the appearance of a single expanse of pavement and to
create a canopy effect.
         4.)   The trees should be of a variety to provide the shade canopy and
have a clear trunk height of at least six feet.
         5.)   The area not covered by the canopy of the tree, but within an
interior landscape area, shall be covered by shrubs, grass, ground cover,
landscape gravel or mulch. Plants in this category may not interfere with
visibility. All plants must be living, thriving and assuming their intended
form.
      (D)   Additional plantings along public streets. Whenever parking areas
consisting of five spaces or more are located such that the parked cars will be
visible from a public street, landscaping, in addition to the required interior
landscaping, shall be required between the street and the parking lot. Such
landscaping shall be a minimum height of three and one-half feet, located
adjacent to the parking lot and shall be placed to effectively obscure a
minimum of 50% of the parking area.
   (6)   Front yard landscaping.
      (A)   In all districts, every part of a front yard shall be open to the
sky, unobstructed, except for parking areas and signs as permitted and
regulated in the district regulations and sign regulations, and shall be
landscaped according to the following minimum requirements.
      (B)   The entire depth and length of the front yard (except as provided
above) shall be permanently protected from soil erosion with grass, trees and
shrubs.
   (7)   Screening of service structures. All development subject to site plan
review shall include the following required screening for loading areas and
service structures.
      (A)   Screening shall consist of an opaque wall or fence, six feet in
height, or dense vegetative planting which effectively obscures 100% of a
loading area when adjacent to residential districts or visible from a public
street.
      (B)   Loading facilities shall be designed to minimize impacts upon
existing or planned uses on abutting properties. Greater amounts of screening
shall be required where the frequency or nature of loading is greater than
typical. Extension of building walls is encouraged to effectively surround,
screen and screen loading areas. Where the height of solid screening cannot
screen loading areas from view of adjacent tall buildings, additional screening
shall be provided with trees.
      (C)   Rubbish areas and dumpsters shall be housed in a wholly enclosed
structure, or completely screened from any parking area or street right-of-way
by a vision-obscuring fence or plant material.
   (8)   Maintenance.
      (A)   All landscaping materials shall be installed and maintained
according to accepted nursery industry procedures. The owner of the property
shall be responsible for the continued property maintenance of all landscaping
materials and shall keep them in a proper, neat and orderly appearance free
from refuse and debris at all times.
      (B)   Unhealthy and dead plants that are required as part of these
requirements shall be replaced within one-year, or by the next planting season,
whichever comes first.
      (C)   Violation of these maintenance practices shall be a violation of
this Code.

limits accessibility to the rear of the structure or to other areas of the site
that may be subject to future development.
      (D)   Orientation.
         1.)   The orientation of structures and uses shall be designed to
promote efficient use of the site and appropriate relationships with abutting
sites and improvements in the district.
         2.)   Alternative orientations shall be permitted where necessary to
minimize disruption of natural grades, to promote positive site drainage or to
preserve natural vegetation.
         3.)   Entries for customers, employees and service activities shall be
appropriately located and sized relative to parking, walkways and loading areas
on site, and to the public street and circulation patterns of abutting sites.
         4.)   Design elements and materials shall be consistently applied to
facades facing public streets. Lesser amounts of detailing, fewer windows and
other variations from the main facades may be approved for rear or side facades
not visible from the public street.

         1.)   Materials specified for exterior surfaces of structures
(including buildings, walls, fences and signs) and for landscape features, such
as pavements and retaining walls, shall be good quality, durable, low
maintenance and appropriate for the exposure, local weather conditions and
application.
         2.)   Buildings shall be comprised of materials that provide for
minimal maintenance, provide a high quality of craftsmanship and aesthetics,
and are compatible with adjacent properties. Primary materials shall consist of
brick, stone and other decorative masonry products (i.e., no standard concrete
masonry units).
            a.)   The following shall be utilized by the DRB and PZC when
reviewing building materials as they apply discretion to the design of the
building, taking into account the scale and use of the building, and design of
the facades (i.e., windows, doors and other design features) to achieve
aesthetically-complete principal and nonprincipal facades.
               i.)   Single-story multi-family buildings shall average a
minimum of 60% primary materials on all principal facades and a minimum of 50%
on all nonprincipal facades, exclusive of glass, windows and doors.

and finish system (EIFS), decorative wood/vinyl sidings, and architectural
metals, may be permitted but shall be secondary, exclusive of gable areas.
            b.)   The DRB and PZC may allow other alternative material(s) as a
primary material if it is the basis of an acceptable facade and/or qualifies as
a material that meets the intent of this section.
            c.)   The DRB shall review and make a recommendation to the PZC.
The PZC shall consider the DRB’s recommendation but retain discretion to
determine the final use of primary and secondary materials as they apply to the
various uses. The PZC shall also take into account the exposure to adjacent
developed properties and/or land for future development. The DRB and PZC may
apply discretion to the percentages noted by either requiring a greater
percentage or permitting a lesser percentage of primary materials.
         3.)   Use of materials which have colors, tones and textures which are
compatible with or complementary to the predominant colors, tones and textures
of existing buildings and other features on abutting and nearby properties
shall be encouraged when such existing structures are determined by the PZC to
be appropriate for their location and in conformance with this Code. Creative
use of diverse materials or diverse colors of the same materials (such as bands

(Prior Code, § 1229.12) (Ord. 2009-21, passed 10-27-2009; Ord. 2022-02, passed
3-8-2022)
§ 157.142 RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   (1)   Purpose.
      (A)   The city has determined that the system of streams within the city
contributes to the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the
community. The purpose of this section is to protect and preserve the water
quality within streams of the city and to protect residents of the city from
property loss and damage because of flooding and other impacts of the stream.
The city will implement this section by controlling uses and developments
within a riparian setback that would impair the ability of the riparian area
to:
         1.)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the
velocity of flood waters and regulating base flow;
         2.)   Stabilize the banks of streams to reduce bank erosion and the
downstream transport of sediments eroded from stream banks;
         3.)   Reduce pollutants in streams during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling and transforming pollutants already present in streams or
in runoff before they enter streams;
         4.)   Provide areas for natural meandering and lateral movement of
stream channels;
         5.)   Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain
diverse and connected riparian vegetation;
         6.)   Provide high quality stream habitats with shade and food to a
wide array of wildlife by maintaining diverse and connected riparian
vegetation; and
         7.)   Benefit the city economically by minimizing encroachment on
stream channels and reducing the need for costly engineering solutions, such as
dams and riprap, to protect structures, and reduce property damage and threats
to the safety of watershed residents, and by contributing to the scenic beauty
and to the environment of the city, the quality of life of the residents of the
city, and corresponding property values.
      (B)   This section has been enacted to protect these services of riparian
areas by providing reasonable controls governing structures and uses in
riparian setbacks.
   (2)   Establishment and applicability of a riparian setback.
      (A)   Riparian setbacks are established as provided in this section.
      (B)   Streams addressed by this section are those which meet the
definition of STREAM and are indicated on at least one of the following maps:
         1.)   USGS topographical map;
         2.)   City riparian setback map; or
         3.)   Soils maps located in the soil survey for the county, USDA and
NRCS.
      (C)   Proposed developments that have riparian setbacks located within
the property’s boundaries may develop an alternative plan for the enhancement
of the riparian corridor. This plan shall be developed by a licensed landscape
architect designed with the intent to improve the riparian corridor using
vegetation more conducive than natural succession (i.e., invasive species),
that allows the free flow of water, that allow humans and nature to enjoy the
corridor. Protection of existing native plants to the maximum extent
practicable shall be a part of the plan. Plans for riparian corridor
improvements shall be approved by the PZC as part of the site or subdivision
plan. Absent said plan, the following shall apply.
      (D)   Widths of setbacks are measured as horizontal map distance outward
from the ordinary high water mark on each side of a stream, and are established
as follows:
         1.)   A minimum of 300 feet on each side of all streams draining an
area greater than 300 square miles;
         2.)   A minimum of 100 feet on each side of all streams draining an
area greater than 20 square miles and up to 300 square miles;
         3.)   A minimum of 75 feet on each side of all streams draining an
area greater than one-half square mile (320 acres) and up to 20 square miles;
         4.)   A minimum of 50 feet on each side of all streams draining an
area greater than 0.05 square mile (32 acres) and up to one-half square mile
(320 acres); and
         5.)   A minimum of 30 feet on each side of all streams draining an
area less than 0.05 square mile (32 acres).
      (E)   The following are exempt from the terms and protection of this
section: grassy swales, roadside ditches, drainage ditches created at the time
of a subdivision to convey storm water to another system, tile drainage
systems, and stream culverts.
      (F)   The following shall apply to the riparian setback.
         1.)   Where the 100-year floodplain is wider than the riparian setback
on either or both sides of the stream, the riparian setback shall be extended
to the outer edge of the 100-year floodplain. The 100-year floodplain shall be
defined by FEMA and subject to review and approval per Ordinance 2002-02.
         2.)   Because the gradient of the riparian corridor significantly
influences impacts on the stream, the following adjustment for steep slopes
will be integrated into the riparian setback formulae for width determination.
 
Table 157.142-1: Width of Riparian Setback
Average Percent Slope Width of Setback
15% to 20%            Add 25 feet
21% to 25%            Add 50 feet
>25%                  Add 100 feet
 
         3.)   Average stream bank slope is to be calculated using methodology
outlined in The Ohio Supplement to Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
Technical Release Number 55 (TR 55) by USDA, NRCS.
         4.)   Where wetlands protected under federal or state law are
identified within the riparian setback, the riparian setback shall consist of
the full extent of the wetlands, plus the following additional setback widths:
            a.)   A 50-foot setback extending beyond the outer boundary of a
Category 3 wetlands;
            b.)   A 30-foot setback extending beyond the outer boundary of a
Category 2 wetlands; or
            c.)   No additional setback will be required adjacent to Category 1
wetlands.
         5.)   Wetlands shall be delineated by a qualified professional under
guidelines established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency, and the delineation approved by the
appropriate agencies. All wetland delineations shall also include the latest
version of the Ohio Rapid Assessment Method for wetland evaluation approved at
the time of application of these regulations.
         6.)   The applicant shall be responsible for delineating the riparian
setback, including any expansions or modifications as required by divisions (2)
(B) through (2)(D) of this section, and identifying this setback on all
subdivisions, land development plans and/or building permit applications. This
delineation shall be done at the time of application of the preliminary plans,
or all plans that are required, or at the time of submission of any permit
applications. This delineation shall be subject to review and approval by the
County SWCD. As the result of this review, the County SWCD may require further
studies from the applicant.
         7.)   Prior to any land disturbance activity, the riparian setback
shall be clearly delineated with construction fencing or other suitable
material by the applicant on site, and such delineation shall be maintained
throughout soil-disturbing activities. The delineated area shall be maintained
in an undisturbed state, unless otherwise permitted by these regulations. All
fencing shall be removed when a development project is completed.
         8.)   No approvals or permits shall be issued by the city prior to
delineation of the riparian setback in conformance with these regulations.
         9.)   Upon completion of an approved subdivision, the riparian setback
shall be permanently recorded on the plat records for the city.
   (3)   Compliance and violations.
      (A)   No preliminary plan for a subdivision, zoning permit, or
certificate of use and occupancy shall be issued by the city without full
compliance with the terms of these regulations, where applicable.
      (B)   Any person or organization who violates division (5)(B) of this
section shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be
subject to punishment as provided in §
130.99, and shall be required to restore the riparian setback through a plan
approved by the County SWCD.
      (C)   The provisions of this section may be enforced through civil or
criminal proceedings brought by the city or county prosecutor on behalf of the
city.
   (4)   Conflicts with other regulations. Where this section imposes a greater
restriction upon land than is imposed or required by any other provision of
law, regulation, contract or deed, the provisions of this section shall
control.
   (5)   Uses in a riparian setback.
      (A)   Permitted uses.
         1.)   The following uses are permitted by right within the riparian
setbacks without prior approval.
            a.)   Open space uses. Open space uses that are passive in
character shall be permitted in the riparian setback, including, but not
limited to, those listed in division (5)(A)2.) of this section. No use
permitted under these regulations shall be construed as allowing trespass on
privately-held lands. Alteration of this natural area is strictly limited.
Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, the riparian setback shall
be preserved in its natural state.
            b.)   Recreational activity. Passive recreational uses, as
permitted by federal, state and local laws, such as hiking, nonmotorized
bicycling, fishing, hunting, picnicking, and similar uses and associated
structures, including boardwalks, pathways constructed of pervious material,
picnic tables and wildlife viewing areas.
            c.)   Removal of damaged or diseased trees. Damaged or diseased
trees may be removed. Because of the potential for felled logs and branches to
damage downstream properties and/or block ditches or otherwise exacerbate
flooding, logs and branches resulting from the removal of damaged or diseased
trees that are greater than six inches in diameter shall be anchored to the
shore or removed from the 100-year floodplain.
            d.)   Revegetation and/or reforestation. The revegetation and/or
reforestation of the riparian setback shall be allowed without approval of the
County SWCD. Species of shrubs and vines recommended for stabilizing flood-
prone areas along streams within the city are listed in Appendix A of this
part.
         2.)   The following uses are permitted by right within the riparian
setbacks with prior approval of the design.
            a.)   Stream bank stabilization/erosion control measures. Best
management practices (BMPs) for stream bank stabilization or erosion control
may be allowed if such practices are within permitted uses by the local, state
and federal government regulations, and are ecologically compatible and
emphasize the use of natural materials and native plant species where practical
and available. Such stream bank stabilization/erosion control practices shall
only be undertaken upon approval of a storm water pollution prevention plan
(SWPPP or SWP3) by the County SWCD.
            b.)   Crossings. In reviewing plans for stream crossings, the city
may confer with the County SWCD, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources,
Division of Natural Areas; the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, Division
