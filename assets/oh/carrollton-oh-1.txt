DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
 
   WHEREAS, the Council of the Village of Carrollton, Ohio, has had the matter
of codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
 
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
 
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council,
 
   NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE VILLAGE OF CARROLLTON,
OHIO:
 
   1.)    That the ordinances of the Village of Carrollton, Ohio, of a general
and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
enacted as the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Carrollton, Ohio, 1987.
      One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as
correct by the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this Ordinance as a
part hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the Village of Carrollton,
Ohio.
 
   2.)    That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions of
the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 5 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to which are inconsistent with any provisions of the Codified
Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this Ordinance,
except as follows:
      (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provisions, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.
      (b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:
         (1)    The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement
or privilege.
         (2)    The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property.
         (3)    The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or
guarantee of payment.
         (4)    The assumption of any contract or obligation.
         (5)    The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness.
         (6)    The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges.

   3.)    That all legislation enacted subsequent to May 18, 1987, which
amended, replaced or otherwise affected a material provision of those
ordinances existing prior to May 18, 1987, shall be deemed to amend, replace or
affect the analogous or comparable section of the Codified Ordinances as
reflected in the Comparative Section Table of the same, or as otherwise
indicated by the content or purpose of such subsequent legislation.
   4.)    That this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety
and welfare of the residents of the Village, the reason for the necessity being
that there exists an imperative need for the earliest publication and
distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of the
Village so as to facilitate administration and daily operation and avoid
practical and legal entanglements.
   5.)    That this Ordinance shall become effective at the earliest date
allowed by law.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

   (f)   Exceptions. The rules of construction shall not apply to any law which
shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when the
subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and

number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless

      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the

133.04 INVESTMENT POLICY.
   (a)   Policy Statement.
      (1)   It is the policy of the Village to invest public funds in a manner
which will provide the maximum security, safety, and preservation of principal
invested with secondary emphasis on achieving the highest yield, while meeting
the daily cash flow demands of the Village and conforming to all applicable
local, State and Federal statutes governing the investment of public funds by
an Ohio municipality.
      (2)   The Treasurer is the investment officer for the Village, charged
with the responsibility for the purchase and sale of investments and the
carrying out of this Investment Policy.
   (b)   Scope. This Investment Policy applies to all financial assets of the
Village, including State and Federal funds held by it. The Treasurer shall
routinely monitor the contents of the Village’s investment portfolio, the
available markets and relative value of competing investments and will adjust
the portfolio accordingly.
   (c)   Prudence.
      (1)   Investments shall be made with the exercise of that degree of
judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of
prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own
affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable
safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived.
      (2)   The standard of prudence to be used by the Treasurer shall be the
“prudent investor” standards and shall be applied in the context of managing
the overall portfolio. Acting in accordance with this Investment Policy and
exercising due diligence shall relieve the Treasurer of personal responsibility
for an individual security’s credit risk or market price changes, provided
deviations from expectations are reported to Council in a timely fashion and
appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
   (d)   Objectives.
      (1)   Banks vary in services they provide, their service fees, interest
rates on interim investments and the minimum compensating balances required for
demand-deposit accounts. The Village’s objective is to obtain good banking
services while minimizing the cost of banking services to the Village.
      (2)   To insure that the City will continue to receive the best service
and rate available and that other financial institutions will have an equal
opportunity to competitively bid in future years, the Village will seek
competitive proposals for depositories of active funds at least every two
years.
      (3)   The primary objectives, in priority order, of the Village’s
investment activity shall be:
         A.   Safety: Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the
investment program. Investments of the Village shall be undertaken in a manner
that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To
attain this objective the Village will diversify its investments to avoid
incurring unreasonable and avoidable risks regarding specific security types or
individual financial institutions.
         B.   Liquidity: The Village’s investment portfolio will remain
sufficiently liquid to enable it to meet all operating requirements, which
might be reasonably anticipated.
         C.   Return on Investment: The Village’s investment portfolio shall be
designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account this Investment Policy and
the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio.
   (e)   Ethics and Conflict of Interest. Persons involved in the investment
process shall refrain from personal business activity which could create a
conflict with proper execution and management of the investment program, or
which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions.
Employees and investment officials shall disclose to the Village any material
financial interest in financial institutions that conduct business with the
Village, and they shall further disclose any large personal financial or
investment positions that could be related to, or affected by, the performance
of the Village’s portfolio. All employees, officers and investment officials to
the Village shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those
of the Village, particularly with regard to the timing of purchases and sales.
   (f)   Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions.
      (1)   The Treasurer will maintain a list of financial institutions and
approved security broker/dealers selected by credit worthiness, who maintain an

Commission Rule 15C3-1 and are registered with the Ohio Department of Commerce
to do business in the State.
      (2)   All financial institutions and broker/dealers which desire to
become qualified suppliers of investment transactions to the Village must

registration and biographical and regulatory information on the persons who are

and consultants which desire to conduct investment business with the Village
must sign a copy of this Investment Policy, certifying they have read it,
understand it and agree to abide by its contents.

   (a)   Purpose. This policy states the official guidelines for acquisition
and usage of the Village’s communications equipment and services and provides
the framework for proper usage of Village issued telephones, cellular phones
and pagers. The frameworks flexibility enables officials and employees to
provide the best service to the public while limiting public expense. While
occasional personal use is permitted, employees should make every effort to
avoid using cellular phones, pagers and desk/wall, cordless phones for personal
calls.
   (b)   Policy Statement. Village telephones, cellular phones and pagers are
provided to Village officials, appointees and employees who by nature of their
job have a routine and continuing business need for use on official Village
business. The Village expects appropriate and responsible use of Village
communication equipment. Elected officials, appointees and department
superintendents are expected to ensure that:
      (1)   The need for each item of Village-owned communication equipment and
services including but not limited to telephones, cellular phones, and pagers
are clearly justified for Village business purposes;
      (2)   Alternative solutions for work production and communications have
been considered;
      (3)   Employees provided with Village communication equipment and
services understand the purpose and limitation of usage;
      (4)   Equipment usage account billings outlining details of usage are
received and reviewed for conformance with this policy;
      (5)   Employees reimburse the Village for non-business use if required by
this policy;
      (6)   Use of a Village equipment usage account is terminated when no
longer justified by business requirements or when the employee has by actions
demonstrated a disregard for the limitation of this policy.
   Employees, who by the nature of their job do not have a routine and
continuing business need for cellular equipment but on occasion need to use
their personal cellular phone for critical Village business, may be approved
for reimbursement. Reimbursement will be made not more than one (1) time per
month for business use of a personal equipment usage account. The amount of
reimbursement will be limited to the lesser of the actual amount of business
phone calls or the amount of the monthly Village rate for an additional
cellular phone added to the existing contract. A copy of the personal invoice
with the business calls highlighted must be submitted with a requisition for
reimbursement.

to ensure their use in accordance with this section.
      (4)   Since the contract with the service provider has a limited amount

caution with cellular phone usage to prevent costly overages in the time
parameters allotted. Each cellular phone has 200 allocated free minutes per
month. However, should an individual cellular phone included in the contract
not use its allocated share it may be used by another cellular phone as long as
the phone using over their allocated minutes does not incur additional charges
to the Village.

is not prohibited but use exceeding de minimus use or that causes additional
costs above and beyond the regular monthly service charge shall be reimbursed
to the Village by the employee.

possession. Employees shall not allow an unauthorized user access to any
Village owned communication equipment except in an emergency situation. The
loss of any cellular or pager equipment must be reported to the Village
Administrator or Chief Fiscal Officer immediately. If theft is suspected, the
police should also be notified immediately.
      (7)   Employees shall exercise extreme caution when driving and only use
a cell phone when the vehicle is parked, unless utilizing a “hands-free”
speakerphone. If your cell phone rings while driving, allow your voicemail to
take the message and retrieve the message when the vehicle is safely parked.
      (8)   Employees shall limit all cellular calls to no more than ten (10)
minutes. Calls over the ten (10) minute limit shall be documented and
justification will be required.
   Knowingly or intentionally violating any provision contained herein shall be
grounds for disciplinary action which may include termination of employment.

147.05 CREDIT CARD POLICY.
   (a)   Purpose.  
      (1)   This policy establishes an orderly process for the authorization,
handling and use of the Village of Carrollton credit card (purchasing card).
This policy is applicable to all Village elected and appointed offices and
departments. It applies to all purchases and purchase-related documents
prepared or processed by the Village departments regardless of the source of
funds. The responsibilities, authorities and contracts set forth in this policy
and related policies and procedures must be adhered to by all Village of
Carrollton elected and appointed officials as well as all departments. The
primary purpose of the credit card (purchasing card) system is for those
vendors that desire immediate payment without issuing a business charge account
or for seldom used vendors.
      (2)   These procedures apply to the Village of Carrollton credit cards
only. The Mayor and/or Clerk-Treasurer may grant exemptions and/or exceptions.
   (b)   Policy Statement. To promote operational efficiency and to simplify
our internal ordering process for purchase of goods and services, the Village
of Carrollton has opted to use a credit card (purchasing card). The credit card
has been established to provide a convenient, efficient means to purchase
commodities and services from vendors. The credit card is intended only for
Village business transactions. This program is designed to delegate authority
and responsibility to purchase items directly for the departments; however a
requisition and purchase order to the Banking Company issuing the credit card
is still required. Each department is responsible for managing its cardholder
accounts in a manner that conforms to this policy and guidelines established by
the Village of Carrollton. A number of unique controls have been developed for
the credit card purchasing program that does not exist in a traditional credit
card environment. These controls ensure that the cards can be used only for
specific monthly dollar limits. In addition, each cardholder is required to
certify all purchases before the bill is submitted for payment.
   (c)   Definitions.
      (1)   Approving Official - Elected/appointed official or department
superintendent responsible for certifying credit card charges for official
Village business.
      (2)   Cardholder - Elected/appointed officials or employees of the
Village of Carrollton who is issued a card and who has authority to use it for
Village business.
      (3)   Eligible Goods - All commodities and capital items that cost less
than $2000.00 and sufficient funds have been appropriated except:
            Worker compensation purchases
      (4)   Credit Card (Purchasing Card) - a credit card issued for official
Village business.
      (5)   Workers Compensation Purchase - Any medical service, treatment or
equipment related to an on-the-job injury.
   (d)   Procedures.  
      (1)   The Card.
         A.   The purchasing card is a credit card, similar to a personal
credit card, which authorizes a cardholder to buy eligible goods and services.
The card is specifically designed showing the name of the Village of Carrollton
Business Card on it to avoid being mistaken for a personal credit card. The
card is subject to existing Village purchasing policies.
         B.   The purchasing card (credit card) may be used for making Village
purchases of $2,000 or less. The master credit card will have a higher limit
and will be issued in the name of the Clerk-Treasurer. Higher purchases may
only be made upon authorization of the Clerk-Treasurer and/or the Mayor after
determining there are sufficient funds appropriated to cover said higher
purchases. The objectives in using the purchase card are to expedite
procurement and reduce purchasing and related payment paperwork by reducing the
number of purchase order transactions for eligible purchases and in use for
traveling purposes. Under no circumstances is the purchasing card to be used
for personal purchases.
      (2)   How to obtain the card. The master credit card will be issued to
the Clerk- Treasurer with a limit to be established by the issuing banking
institution. Additional cards will be issued having a credit limit of $2,000.00
to the Village Administrator and those employees designated by their
superintendents, which will be at least one employee or superintendent per
department. All credit card account numbers will be on file in the office of
the Clerk-Treasurer, who will have the authority to close the account upon
termination of the cardholder.
      (3)   Cardholder. The cardholder is the individual to whom the card is
issued. The purchase card bears the cardholder’s name and may only be used by
the cardholder. No other person is authorized to use the card. Cardholders may
purchase eligible goods and services within their authority, as required by the
Village, subject to funds availability. The cardholder is responsible for all
purchases made with the card. All purchases that will be paid using the card
must comply with the Village of Carrollton’s purchasing resolutions, policies
and department policies.
      (4)   How to use the purchase card. The same basic procedures are
followed for mail and phone order purchases; although the supplier may request
additional information such as the cardholder’s shipping address.
         A.   Over-the-Counter Purchases. Although the process may vary
slightly, the following steps give a general overview of how the purchase card
works. A cardholder using the purchase card should:
            1.   Identify the purchase needed and determine funds availability.
            2.   Determine if the purchase is within their pre-approved
purchase limit. If yes, proceed to the next step. If no, check, with their
supervisor or the chief financial officer on how to proceed.
            3.   Purchase goods/services. Provide merchant with the purchase
card. Inform the merchant that the purchase is for “official Village business”
and is not subject to state or local sales tax. Provide a sales tax certificate
of exemption is required by merchant.
            4.   Submit a completed requisition dated the same day as the
purchase and submit to accounting office for purchase order as soon as
possible. Emergency purchases should be indicated on the requisition as a “Then
and Now” purchase.
            5.   Forward receipt of the accounting office.
         B.   Telephone orders. An employee using the purchase card to order by
telephone should:
            1.   Identify the purchase needed and determine funds availability.
            2.   Determine if the purchase amount is within the pre-approved
purchase limit. If yes, proceed to the next step. If no, check with their
supervisor or the chief financial officer for details on how to proceed.
            3.   Contact the merchant and place the order.
            4.   Purchase goods/services. Inform the merchant that the purchase
if for “official Village business” and is not subject to state or local sales
tax. Provide merchant with the card number and expiration date.
            5.   Relay all pertinent information to supplier, (e.g.
Cardholder’s name, shipping address, etc.)
            6.   Submit a completed requisition to accounting office on the
same date or as soon as possible with the amount of purchases.
            7.   Inspect and verify order accuracy, quality, and price when
merchandise arrives.
            8.   Retain shipping documents and receipts received with the
merchandise.
            9.   Submit billing documents to the accounting office.
         C.   Internet Orders.
            1.   Identify the purchase needed and determine funds availability.
            2.   Determine if the purchase amount is within the pre-approved
purchase limit. If yes, proceed to the next step. If no, check with their
supervisor or the chief financial officer for details on how to proceed.
            3.   Locate the merchant’s web site and place the order.
            4.   Purchase goods/services. Enter card number and expiration
date. Some web sites will recognize that the purchase is tax exempt. If not,
indicate that the purchase is tax exempt. Note that the cardholder should check
to see if the web site they are accessing is secure before entering their
purchase card account number. Check the Internet browser software and any
information posted on the web site being accessed for more information
regarding the level of security provided.
            5.   Relay all pertinent information to supplier (e.g. Cardholder
name, shipping date, etc.) Note: If downloading a purchased product from the
Internet, print out the electronic confirmation and include it with the
transaction documentation.
            6.   Submit a completed requisition to the accounting office on the
same date or as soon as possible with the amount of purchase and identify fund
being charged.
            7.   Inspect and verify order accuracy, quality and price when
merchandise arrives.
            8.   Retain shipping documents received with merchandise.
            9.   Submit billing documents to the accounting office.
      (5)   Tax Exemption. Charges for most purchased items or services that
are billed directly to the Village of Carrollton are exempt from sales tax. For
large purchases where the merchant refuses to waive the tax, the cardholder can
present a state tax exemption form. Contact the accounts payable office for a
copy of the tax exemption.
      (6)   Cardholder Responsibilities.
         A.   Purchasing resolutions, policies and procedures place upon the
cardholder direct responsibility for the proper and lawful execution of
purchasing actions. No employee of the Village of Carrollton has authority to
issue instruction or approve a procedure that is in direct violation with the
law or Village’s resolutions, policies or procedures. Any act exceeding that
individual’s authority is no longer an act of the Village but becomes a
personal responsibility. This may include personal financial responsibility for
the purchase and consideration of disciplinary action up to and including
removal from position and possible criminal prosecution.
         B.   All employees must maintain the highest standard of conduct. Any
conflict of interest or appearance thereof between Village responsibilities and
personal lives must be avoided.
         C.   Cardholder responsibilities are to:
            1.   Make eligible purchases within authorized spending limits and
funds availability. Use the card only for purchasing items in accordance with
Village policies.
            2.   The cardholder must first inform the merchant that the
purchase is for “official Village business” and is not subject to state or
local sales tax. For large purchases where the merchant refused to waive the
tax, the cardholder can present a state tax exemption form. Cardholders can get
a copy of the form from the accounting office.
            3.   Maintain purchase cards in a secure fashion and prevent
unauthorized charges to the account.
            4.   Maintain adequate documentation of all purchases. This
responsibility includes documentation of funds availability, receipts, packing
lists, invoices, etc.
            5.   Give purchase documentation to the accounting office in a
timely manner to ensure prompt payment.
            6.   Notify the Department Superintendent or the Clerk- Treasurer
immediately if the card is lost or stolen.
      (7)   Card security. The cardholder is responsible for safeguarding the
purchase card at all times. The cardholder should never allow anyone else to
use the card or account number and should never use the card to procure
personal items.
      (8)   Lots/stolen cards. When a purchase card is lost or stolen, the
cardholder should contact the Department Superintendent or the Clerk-Treasurer
to report the lost/stolen card. Contact should be immediate so that the highest
level of detail regarding account activity leading up to the lost/stolen date
can be provided.
      (9)   Separation of cardholder. Prior to separation from the cardholder’s
department or assignment to another function that does not require cardholder
authority, the cardholder will surrender the card to the Clerk- Treasurer who
will destroy it and notify the banking company forthwith. The cardholder will
review with the Department Superintendent the status of any unreconciled,
questionable, partially approved, unresolved, and disputed transactions, and
identify any supplies and/or services which have been ordered but not yet
received, so appropriate action can be taken to complete these activities.
      (10)   Purchase card changes. There may be occasions when the information
about the cardholder in the bank’s master file must be changed (e.g., address
change, etc.) the Clerk-Treasurer or his/her staff will make the appropriate
change.
      (11)   Card misuse/fraud. Misuse of the purchase card will require the
purchase card to be withdrawn from the cardholder. Disciplinary actions may be
taken against the cardholder. The cardholder may be liable for payment of the
purchase.
      (12)   Competition. Purchases within the dollar threshold can be awarded
without soliciting competitive price quotations if the price is reasonable.
Such purchases must be distributed equitably among qualified suppliers. When
practicable, a quotation should be solicited from other then the previous
supplier prior to placing a repeat order. The administrative cost of verifying
the reasonableness of the price of purchases not in excess of $2,000 may more
than offset potential savings in detecting instances of over pricing.
Therefore, actions to verify the reasonableness of the price need to be taken
only when:
         A.   Information indicates that the price may not be reasonable (e.g.
comparison to previous price paid, personal knowledge of the item involved,
comparison to similar items).
         B.   Purchasing a supply or service for which no comparable pricing
information is readily available (e.g., an item that is not the same or similar
to other items recently purchased).
   (e)   Acknowledgment. As an employee of the Village of Carrollton, I have
read and understand the Village of Carrollton’s Policy on credit cards
(purchasing cards). Further, that I am aware that any violation of this policy
may subject me to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge from
employment and possible criminal prosecution.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R. C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a
jury at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)    Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more than six
months, or
   (b)    Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases,
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville  as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman
v.Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any

Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of

   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's

If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal

one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the

            (i)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)    The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in section
183.051 of this Chapter.
               (d)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)    For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
183.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section
183.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than

Municipality, providing the name, address, and social security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of

required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
      (2)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino

      (4)    A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (5)    If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties

withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.

lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding

the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period that information shall be
indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent

following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax

returns required under this section.

Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net

         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section

      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B) (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in

Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
 183.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division

      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax

taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall

         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)    The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the Municipality, unless the taxpayer is an individual who
resides in the Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined
company, or telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports

      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (F)(2) and (G) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         (a)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
         As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
183.04(C);
         (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(l) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
183.32(A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
183.32 (A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)    As used in division (F)(l)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,

            (i)    The employer;
            (ii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or
a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            (iii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person
described in (F)(3)(a)(ii) of this section, or a related member of such a
vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F)(3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)    For the purposes of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and except
as provided in division (G) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as
follows:
         (a)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property
shall be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated.
            For the purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in
the Municipality if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any
of the following criteria:
            (i)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the
Municipality from a stock of goods located within the Municipality.
            (ii)    The property is delivered within the Municipality from a
location outside the Municipality, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
Municipality and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            (iii)    The property is shipped from a place within the
Municipality to purchasers outside the Municipality, provided that the taxpayer
is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or
promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
         (b)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
the Municipality to the extent that such services are performed in the
Municipality.
         (c)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to the
Municipality.
         (d)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to
the Municipality.
         (e)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Municipality based upon the extent to which
the tangible personal property is used in the Municipality.
      (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Municipality's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the Municipality or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the
Municipality. The Municipality shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported

applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the
Municipality to the commissions received from the sale, purchase or lease of
real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the Municipality shall
report the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the
individual's annual tax return for the Municipality. The individual may claim a
credit for taxes the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal
corporation to the extent that such a credit is allowed under the
Municipality's income tax ordinance.
      (7)    When calculating the ratios described in division (F)(l) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (8)    Intentionally left blank.
   (G)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
183.05 of this Chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment.
         The election applies to the taxable year for which that return or
appeal is filed and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer
revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(F)(l) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(l)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(l)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
183.05 of this Chapter.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.

   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
183.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
 183.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
183.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
183.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
183.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
 183.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

183.064 TAX CREDIT FOR BUSINESSES THAT FOSTER NEW JOBS IN OHIO.
   The Municipality, by Ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable
credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of
the credit. (Ord. 2015- 43. Passed 11-23-15.)

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as
paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal
amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.

estimated taxes.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division

of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the

      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the tax

      (2)    A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section
 183.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)    For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)    For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)    An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to section
183.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:

         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
183.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
(Ord. 2015-43. Passed 11-23-15.)
183.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
183.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (A)    Every individual resident taxpayer with Municipal Taxable Income as
calculated in Section
183.041(A) earned for work done or services performed or rendered outside of
the Village of Carrollton, if it be made to appear that he/she has paid a
municipal income tax to another municipality on the same income taxable under
this chapter, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter
of the amount so paid by the taxpayer or on his/her behalf to such other
municipality; provided, however, that the credit shall not exceed one-half of
one percent (0.5%) on such income earned in such other municipality or
municipalities where such tax is paid.
   (B) The credit provided in division (A) of this section shall not be allowed
unless the credit is claimed in a timely filed return or on a form acceptable
to, and filed with the Tax Administrator, including any extension granted under
Section 183.094. If the taxpayer fails, neglects or refuses to file such timely
return or form, he/she shall not be entitled to such credit and shall be liable
for the full amount of tax imposed by this chapter, together with such interest
and penalties, both civil and criminal, as are imposed by this chapter.
   (C) No such credit shall be given for any tax paid to a school district or a

(Ord. 2015-43. Passed 11-23-15.)
183.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation. (Ord. 2015-43. Passed 11-23-15.)
183.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
183.081 of this Chapter. (Ord. 2015-43. Passed 11-23-15.)
183.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
183.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
183.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
183.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
183.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 2015-43. Passed 11-23-15.)
183.09 ANNUAL RETURN.
183.091 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   (1)    An annual municipal income tax return shall be completed and
filed by every taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject
to the tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection
183.051(C) of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole
income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due to the
Municipality.
      (3)   All resident individual taxpayers, 18 years of age and older, shall
file an annual municipal income tax return with the Municipality, regardless of
income or liability.
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary
shall provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to
support that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the
taxpayer. This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   
   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)    A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)    A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality. The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each return
required to be filed under this section shall be completed and filed as
required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed for the
filing of state individual income tax returns under division (G) of Section
5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice
on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the Municipality. No remittance is required if the
net amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Municipality's income
tax return. The extended due date of the Municipality's income tax return shall
be the 15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the
extended due date of the Municipality's income tax return for a taxpayer that
is not an individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last
day of the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to
file under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due
unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Municipality's income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's Municipality income tax return. If the request is
received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Municipality income
tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested
extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
Municipality's income tax return. The extended due date of the Municipality's
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
         If a tax administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in Section
183.092, the provisions in Section
183.092 prevail.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
 183.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in section
183.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in section
183.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 2015-43. Passed 11-23-15; Ord. 2023-43. Passed 11-13-23.)

reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the

civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.

qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year. (Ord. 2015-43. Passed 11-23-15.)
183.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED,
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.

amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 2015-43. Passed 11-23-15.)
183.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the

183.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
section
183.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of
section
183.19 of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond
the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in section
183.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 2015-43. Passed 11-23-15.)
183.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
183.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
183.10 of this Chapter.
   (E)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in

183.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice

Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section
 183.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in section
183.99 of this Chapter for a violation of

official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or

the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 2015-43. Passed 11-23-15.)
183.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 2015-43. Passed 11-23-15.)
183.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality.
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)    No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)    A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 2015-43. Passed 11-23-15.)
183.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
183.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
 183.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
 183.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to
which the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that
the amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less
than the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the
appellant's assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the
overpayment as provided by Section 183.096 of this Chapter, with interest on
that amount as provided by division (D) of that section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
           (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition
of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-43. Passed 11-23-15.)
183.20 ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the legislative
authority of the Municipality has the authority, by Ordinance or Resolution, to
adopt rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.

      1.   If there is a written lease or rental agreement, the person(s) who
signed the written lease or rental agreement with the owner or their agent.
      2.   If there is an oral lease or rental agreement, the person(s) who
entered into the oral lease or rental agreement with the owner or their agent.

this Section shall be fined not more than $100.00. A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance
occurs or continues.
         (b)    Whoever violates or fails to comply with any provision of this
Section, and has a previous conviction under this Ordinance, shall be fined not
more than $500.00. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during

(Ord. 2015-43. Passed 11-23-15.)
183.22 FILING NET PROFIT TAXES; ELECTION TO BE SUBJECT TO PROVISIONS OF
CHAPTER.
   (A)   A taxpayer may elect to be subject to Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances in lieu of the provisions set forth in the
remainder of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,
upon the taxpayer's election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)    The state tax commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator
of the municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer as defined in 183.23(C)
of the Codified Ordinances is liable for the term of the election;
      (2)    The commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to sections
718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code, Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances, and any applicable provision of Chapter 5703
of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the tax commissioner and the Village, on a form prescribed by the

      (2)   (a)    The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the
taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the tax commissioner and the Village of its
termination of the election.
         (b)    A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (c)    Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the

      (2)    Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)    Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out
the duties imposed upon the tax commissioner by those sections.
   (D)    The tax commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as
that term is defined in section 718.01 of the Revised Code and Section
183.03 of the Village Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 2018-07. Passed 3-26-18.)
183.23 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703. of the Revised
Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference
in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and Section
183.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall control
for all uses of that term in Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
183.24 of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code and
Section
183.03 of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
Section
183.28 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of Section
183.28 of the Codified Ordinances.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (47)(B)(i) of Section
183.03 of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded partnership
that has made the election described in division (23)(D) of Section
183.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal
taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation,
except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a
partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
183.03 of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not include
natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745 of
the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal income
taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section
183.32 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 2018-07. Passed 3-26-18.)
183.24 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the Village and that has made the election under Section
183.22 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of the
real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the
same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever the
individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which taxes
are not required to be withheld under Section
183.052 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the Village to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Village, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may require,
that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
183.32 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
183.32 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the Village
as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the Village only if, regardless of where title passes, the
property meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the Village from
a stock of goods located within the Village.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the Village from a location
outside the Village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Village to the extent that such services are performed in the Village.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the Village.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the
Village.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the Village.
   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the Village in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the Village based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the Village to the commissions received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (C)(12) and (R)(1)(d) of Section
183.03 of the Codified Ordinances by the Village or substantially similar
provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the
taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's
net profit that was apportioned to the Village. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the Village any
amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay
tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Village] under
this section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

         (Ord. 2018-07. Passed 3-26-18.)
183.26 FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   (1)    For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual

         (b)    A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically
through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the tax
commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission

commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)    An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with this chapter, the commissioner may

the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the

183.28 CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
183.22 of the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer under
division (B)(1) or (2) of Section
183.063 of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the tax commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under Section
183.22 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that

return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
183.23 of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of Section
183.23 of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
183.24 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
183.24 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in Section
183.24 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
183.24 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from"
appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations"
for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Section
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.

183.29 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.

183.22 of the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under
Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before the
date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under Section

income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)    (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;

paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 2018-07. Passed 3-26-18.)
183.31 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.

commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the

this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a

to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to
fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section
183.33 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
Section
183.32 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for the
assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 2018-07. Passed 3-26-18.)
183.32 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under Section
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Section
183.33 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section
183.33 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by
that section.
(Ord. 2018-07. Passed 3-26-18.)
183.33 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of Section
183.32 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 2018-07. Passed 3-26-18.)
183.34 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under Section
183.22 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
183.32 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
183.33 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
183.33 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 2018-07. Passed 3-26-18.)
183.35 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to Sections
183.22 to
183.37 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

is to be applied.
      (2)    Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the Village and taxpayer under Section
183.064 or
183.065 of the Codified Ordinances,, or to modify the terms or conditions of
any such existing agreement.

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee
may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.
      (3)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (4)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to

days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
(ORC 4511.99)
313.05 SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those

      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample isobtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the

notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant

station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.

            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of

drive any motor vehicle in and upon any street or highway at a greater speed
than will permit the person to bring it to a stop within the assured clear
distance ahead.
   (b)   It is prima-facie lawful, in the absence of a lower limit declared or

and specifications for a uniform system of traffic control devices shall be
construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs equipped with
flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the hours in which
the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:
            1.    Any school chartered under Ohio R.C. 3301.16;
            2.    Any nonchartered school that during the preceding year filed
with the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce in compliance with O.A.C. §

both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.
   (d)   Whoever violates subsection (a) of this section is guilty of operating
a motor vehicle while using an electronic wireless communication device, an
unclassified misdemeanor, and shall be punished as provided in subsections (d)
(1) to (5) of this section.
      (1)   The offender shall be fined, and is subject to a suspension of the
offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction
permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege, as follows:
         A.   Except as provided in subsections (d)(1)B., (d)(1)C., (d)(1)D.
and (d)(2) of this section, the court shall impose upon the offender a fine of

         B.   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one prior violation of this section, Ohio
R.C. 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court
shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00).
         C.   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more prior violations of this section,
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent or municipal ordinance, the
court shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00). The court also may impose a suspension of the offender’s
driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege for ninety days.
         D.   Notwithstanding subsections (d)(1)A. to (d)(1)C. of this section,
if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with Ohio R.C.
4511.98, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall
impose upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the
violation under subsections (d)(1)A., (d)(1)B., or (d)(1)C. of this section, as
applicable.
      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom subsection
(d)(1)A of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00) under subsection (d)(1)A. of this section and the
assessment of points under subsection (d)(4) of this section, the offender

shall be assessed for a violation of subsection (a) of this section in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and Ohio R.C. 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense
as a strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based
on the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for the purposes of enforcing this
section unless the officer visually observes the operator using, holding, or

wireless communications device.

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or
is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest of or commencing a

   (g)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Occupant restraining device” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C.
4513.263.

   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile

plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C.
4503.233.
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded

the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded

issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as

proceeds from any fine imposed under this subsection shall be distributed in
accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be
ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community

criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.
4507.35 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a

evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

pleaded guilty to one violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.11 or Ohio R.C. 4510.111 or

for thirty days and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license plates for thirty
days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         B.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

of two violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11 or Ohio R.C. 4510.111 or 4510.16, or of
a substantially similar municipal ordinance, the court, in addition to any
other sentence that it imposes on the offender may order the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11, or any
combination of three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4501.11 or Ohio R.C.

declaration of forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five
years after the date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or

as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of

353.01 DEFINITIONS.
   The following words and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them:
   (a)   “Parking meter” means a mechanical device installed for the regulation
of parking by lawful authority. Each parking meter shall contain a slot for the
deposit of lawful coin of the United States and a receptacle for receiving and
storing such coin. Each parking meter shall display brief directions as to its
operation and the value of lawful coin required to be deposited. Each parking
meter shall contain a timing mechanism which shall indicate either a balance of
legal parking time or overtime parking by an appropriate signal at the
expiration of such lawful time.
   (b)   “Parking meter space” means a space within a parking meter area, which
is designated for the parking of a single vehicle by marked lines on the curb
or paved surface area adjacent to a parking meter. Posted notice on the meter
or on signs shall indicate the maximum consecutive parking time limit during
which a vehicle may be legally parked in a particular parking meter space and
the days and hours when the requirement to deposit lawful coins shall apply.
(A.O.)
   (c)   “Traffic Control Map” means that map outlined Section
353.14 of the Codified Ordinances.

353.02 PARKING WITHIN MARKED LINES OF METER SPACE.
   No person shall park a vehicle in a parking meter space in such a way that
the vehicle shall not be entirely within the limits of the space so designated
by marked lines.
353.03 DEPOSIT OF COIN REQUIRED; ILLEGAL PARKING.
   No person shall cause, allow or permit a vehicle to occupy a parking meter
space during the hours when the provisions applicable to such space are in
effect, unless he shall deposit such lawful coin of the United States of
appropriate denomination in the adjacent parking meter, as required by
directions on the meter. Such person is not required to deposit a coin in a
meter which indicates a balance of unused legal parking time left by the
previous occupant of the space, so long as his occupancy of the space does not

lawfully occupied by such vehicle during the balance of legal parking time
shown on the meter provided such occupancy does not exceed the established
maximum time limit.
   No person shall fail to comply with directions displayed on the parking
meter or fail to set the timing mechanism in operation when so required.

conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is

commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.
Evidence that a person was voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show
whether or not the person was physically capable of performing the act with
which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. (ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment

source, privileged under Ohio R.C. 2739.04 or 2739.12.

any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2909.11)

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
 545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08, 
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
 545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05, 
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
 545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

761.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to regulate adult cabarets to
promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the
Village and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations in order to prevent
any deleterious location and concentration of adult cabarets within the
Village, thereby reducing and eliminating any adverse secondary effects from
such businesses. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor
the effect of imposing a limitation or a restriction on the content of any
communicative materials, including sexually-oriented materials. Similarly, it
is neither the intent nor the effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access
by adults to sexually-oriented materials protected by the First Amendment or to
deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually-oriented
entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent or the effect
of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials.

         (Ord. 1993-16. Passed 8-23-93.)
      (3)    Pavement thickness. The concrete pavement thickness shall be as
specified or in conformance with the following table:
 
5 inches Through streets
6 inches Collector streets
7 inches Arterial streets
      (4)    Equipment. Equipment shall be as follows:
         A.    Regular finishing equipment for finishing concrete pavements
shall be mechanical, self-propelled spreading and finishing machines either the
slip-form or form riding types, and shall be capable of compacting and
finishing the concrete.
         B.    If side forms are used they shall be straight, and of a depth
equal to or greater than the specified thickness of the pavement. All forms
shall be in sections not less than ten feet in length on a base width
sufficient to prevent displacement from line or grade during paving. Flexible
or curve forms shall be used for construction of circular pavement where the
radius is 100 feet or less. Forms shall have adequate devices for secure
setting and locks for joining the ends of abutting form sections together
tightly.
      (5)    Backfilling trenches. Trenches for installation of utilities and
drainage shall be carefully backfilled to avoid subsequent consolidation and
settlement. All trenches under the pavement area shall be backfilled using
Controlled Density Fill (CDF) material. The CDF shall extend for the full depth
of the trench up to the subgrade level. Trenches beyond the pavement area may
be backfilled with CDF, soil or granular materials.
      (6)    Subgrade preparation. The subgrade under all pavement areas shall
be constructed to the specified line and grade. It shall be compacted to the
maximum uniform density at, or slightly above, optimum moisture. Moisture shall
be maintained at, or slightly above, optimum until the concrete pavement is
constructed. All areas that cannot be compacted to the uniform density and
areas that are soft or spongy shall be removed, replaced with suitable material
similar to the adjoining subgrade and compacted, or with Controlled Density
Fill.
      (7)    Finegrading of subgrade or base.
         A.    After the subgrade has been compacted to the specified density,
the areas on which the pavement is to be constructed including the areas which
will support the paving machine or side forms shall be cut to the plan
elevation. If side forms are used, they shall be set to line and grade and
securely fastened.
         B.    A minimum two inch base shall be placed, compacted and brought
to final grade after the subgrade is completed and accepted. The base shall be
daylighted to the slope.
      (8)    Placing concrete. The concrete shall be deposited on prepared
subgrade or base in a manner that requires as little rehandling as possible.
For concrete placed when the temperature of the air is thirty-five degrees
Fahrenheit or below, the concrete immediately after placing shall have a
temperature between fifty and eighty degrees Fahrenheit. The subgrade or base
shall be entirely free from frost when concrete is deposited.
      (9)    Consolidating and finishing. The pavement shall be finished by an
approved slip-form paver or form riding finishing machine operated over each
section of pavement to produce the specified results.
         A.    On small projects with variable widths the pavement may be
finished by an approved vibratory screed in lieu of a finishing machine.
         B.    The surface shall be continuously checked for trueness with ten-
foot straightedges. If the pavement surface is dragged with a diagonal or vee-
shaped float, only occasional straightedge surface checks, while the concrete
is plastic, will be required.
         C.    Before the concrete has taken its initial set, the edges of the
pavement along each side shall be worked with an approved tool and rounded to a
radius of one-fourth inch. The edges along each side of an expansion joint
shall be rounded to a radius of one-eighth inch. The pavement shall be textured
to provide a satisfactory surface. A transverse broom texture or an artificial
turf drag shall be applied to provide a uniform gritty texture.
      (10)    Joints. Joints shall be constructed to the type, dimensions and
at locations specified.
          A.    Longitudinal joint. Longitudinal joints shall be constructed by
sawing or by forming between adjoining lanes of concrete pavement. Normally the
distance between longitudinal joints or longitudinal joints and pavement edges
will be twelve feet. In no case should this distance exceed sixteen feet.
   If the longitudinal joint between simultaneously placed lanes is made with a
concrete saw, sawing shall be done to a minimum depth of one-third of the
specified pavement thickness as soon as possible, but no later than the
following day. The width shall be approximately one-eighth inch.
         B.    Transverse joints. Transverse joints shall be constructed by
sawing to a minimum depth of one-fourth of the specified pavement thickness and
a maximum width of three-eighths inch (determined at the time of sawing).
joints shall be continuous across the full width of slab, including adjoining
lanes, curbs, and curb and gutter sections. Joints shall be sawed as soon as
the saw can be operated without damaging the concrete. In lieu of sawing,
joints may be hand formed on small projects or on irregular shaped sections of
the pavement, as approved by the Engineer.
Unless otherwise indicated on the plans, maximum spacing of transverse joints
shall be in accordance with the, following:
 
Pavement Thickness (inches) Maximum Spacing (feet)
5                           12
6                           15
7                           15
 
The maximum spacing of transverse joints should not exceed fifteen feet for
plain concrete pavements regardless of thickness.
         C.    Construction joints. Construction joints shall be constructed at
the end of each day's work and whenever necessary to suspend work for more than
thirty minutes.
         D.    Load transfer. Load transfer devices are only required in
transverse expansion and construction joints in arterial streets. One inch
smooth round dowels shall be placed at one-foot intervals transversely and at
mid-depth of the pavement. An assembly shall be used to maintain dowels
parallel to the centerline of the pavement surface, and to one another during
construction.
   Tiebars shall be installed at five foot intervals in the longitudinal joints
in streets without curbs or curb and gutter sections. Tiebars shall be five-
eighths inch diameter deformed bars, thirty inches in length. They shall be
installed at mid-depth of the pavement.
         E.    Expansion joints. Expansion joints shall be constructed on each
side of a bridge at approximately twenty and sixty feet from the bridge
approach slab. A one-inch thick pre-formed filler shall extend the full width
and depth of the pavement. If joint sealing is specified, an opening one inch
in width by one inch in depth shall be formed for installation of the joint
sealer.
         F.    Isolation joints. A minimum one-fourth inch thickness pre-formed
filler shall be installed wherever the pavement abuts adjoining concrete or
masonry walls, around manholes, catch basins and all interruptions in the
pavement. The filler shall extend the full width and depth of the pavement to
isolate the new concrete from existing and allow for differential vertical
movements.
      (11)    Curbs. Curbs shall be constructed along the edges of all street
where shown on the plans and shall be formed to the cross-section specified.
Curbs, and curbs and gutters, may be constructed integrally with the pavement
using slipform or extrusion equipment, or placed immediately after finishing
operations using face forms, or they may be hand formed. Curbs, or curb and
gutter sections, may be constructed as a separate operation before or after
pavement construction using forms, slipforms or extrusion equipment. If
constructed prior to the pavement, the curb and gutter section may be used as
forms.
      (12)    Curing. Immediately after the finishing operations have been
completed and after the free water has evaporated from the surface, the
concrete shall be cured by spraying thereon a uniform application of curing
membrane in such a manner as to provide a continuous uniform film without
marring the texture of the surface. A minimum of one gallon of material shall
be used for each 200 square feet of surface. Curing material shall be
thoroughly agitated immediately prior to use.
If forms are used, the pavement edges shall be coated with the curing material
as soon as the forms are removed. Any areas of pavement film that may have been
damaged shall be resprayed during this operation. Curing may also be
accomplished by means of water curing with wet burlap cloth, waterproof paper
or polyethylene sheeting. Curing shall be applied as soon after the finishing
operations as possible without marring the surface texture. Curing shall be
continued for seven days unless specimen beams have attained a modulus of
rupture of 600 psi.
   The contractor responsible for protecting the concrete from freezing. The
above requirements are minimum requirements only. Any concrete showing injury
or damage due to inadequate or improper curing shall be repaired by the
contractor at no additional cost.
      (13)    Surface smoothness. The concrete pavement surface shall be
constructed to a tolerance of one-fourth inch in ten feet. Sections of pavement
containing depressions that cannot be corrected by grinding shall be repaired
by the contractor.
      (14)    Sealing joints. Joint sealing is specified. Joints shall be
sealed as soon after completion of the sawing as is feasible and before the
pavement is opened for use. Just prior to sealing, each joint shall be
thoroughly cleaned of all foreign material by a jet of water or air under
pressure. The joint faces shall be clean and surface dry when the seal is
applied. For transverse joint sealing, backer rod material shall be installed
in each joint so the top is three-fourths of an inch below the pavement
surface. Joint seal material shall be applied and the surface struck-off so
that the top of the sealing material is one-fourth of an inch below the
pavement surface. The completed sealed joint shall be clean and neat without
any sealing material on the pavement surface.
      (15)    Opening to traffic. The completed pavement may be opened for
general use when seven days have elapsed. The pavement may be opened for
general use when seven days have elapsed. The pavement may be opened to local
traffic after three days have elapsed, provided that test beams are made and a
modulus of rupture of 600 psi has been attained.
      (16)    The following illustrations are provided to supplement the
previous concrete street specifications. (See Exhibit A.)
   (c)    Inspection personnel will be designated by Council and all costs for
same will be paid by the developer. The charge for inspections of street
construction shall be the actual expense incurred on an hourly basis.
   (d)    A street profile, drawn by a registered engineer, will be provided
showing grade, street name, street materials and specifications, any utilities
within street right of way and any other pertinent information necessary for
proper street construction. Copies will be provided for Planning Commission,
Clerk-Treasurer, Board of Public Affairs and Council.
   (e)    For a period of three years from completion of street construction,
the developer shall make any repairs required by Council.
   (f)    Whenever the strict enforcement of this section would entail unusual,
real and substantial difficulties or hardships, the Planning Commission and
Council may vary or modify the terms in such a way that the subdivider is
allowed to plan and develop his property and make necessary improvements
without unjust difficulties and hardships, if at the same time the public
interests of the Municipality are fully protected and the general intent and
purpose of this section is preserved. (Ord. 1990-13. Passed 7-9-90.)

the Planning Commission, for any residential, commercial or industrial
subdivision or development, shall include a metes and bounds description for
all easements for water and sewer lines traversing or bounded by all lots,
acreage or roadways within such subdivision or development. Such description
shall provide for at least a thirty foot easement. All original easements shall
be properly executed by the owner of the subdivision or development recorded
and delivered to the Clerk-Treasurer within sixty days of final approval by
Council of the subdivision or development.
   (b)    Each developer or subdivider shall submit a map along with a metes
and bounds description, such map designating the location of all water/sewer
lines, distances between manholes, the measurement and location of each lateral
located in the plat and the curb box or service connection of the proposed
water line.
   (c)    As a condition to approval by Council of any subdivision or
development, a developer or subdivider shall, if the Village Administrator
requests, provide access through the subdivison or development water and sewer
lines for an extension of such lines beyond the subdivision to adjacent lands.
To facilitate this access, the developer or subdivider shall, upon the Village
Administrators' request, provide a written, fully executed easement for area
over and across a lot or portion of the proposed subdivision or development
providing such potential access to adjacent lands, per subsection (a) hereof.
   (d)    The subdivider or developer shall provide the Village with a one year
warranty on all water and sewer lines and other components necessary to provide
water and sewer service to the subdivision from the time of installation.

all maintenance and repair costs incurred or which are necessary. At or before
the expiration of this one year period, the water and sewer lines and
components shall be inspected by a designated representative of the Water and
Sewer Department. Should the inspection reveal the need for any repairs or
maintenance for such lines and components, the subdivider or developer shall
make all such necessary repairs. In the alternative the Village may make all
necessary repairs and changes and charge the costs to the subdivider or
developer.
   (e)    The subdivider or developer shall assume all costs and expenses
related to the construction and installation of the water and sewer lines and
components in each place or subdivision for which the subdivider seeks
approval. The subdivider or developer shall hold the Village harmless for all
such costs and expenses. The Village Council has the right to refuse final
approval of the plat without written documentation that all construction costs
have been paid or secured to be paid.
   (f)    (1)    The subdivider or developer must submit, as a part of the
preliminary plat, detailed written plans and maps specifically designating the
proposed subdivision or development which plans are sufficiently detailed to
allow the Water and Sewer Department to make a determination whether the water
and sewer lines and components proposed are able to provide adequate service to
the residents or occupants of the development or subdivision. A representative
of the Water and Sewer Department shall provide a written recommendation to
approve or deny the proposed plan. If the plan is not approved, the Water and
Sewer Department shall state in writing the specific requirements yet to be met
before approval granted. The recommendation must be submitted to the Planning
Commission between the submission of the preliminary plat and the next regular
meeting of the Planning Commission.
      (2)    After approval of the preliminary plan, the subdivider or
developer must, if he or she proposes any changes in the approved water and
sewer lines and components, obtain additional written approval from the Water
and Sewer Department prior to the commencement of construction. If further
easements are necessary for the changes, compliance with subsection (a) is also
required.

      (52)    "User charge system" means a system to assure that each recipient
of wastewater treatment service pays his proportionate share of the cost of
operation and maintenance, including replacement, of the wastewater treatment
facilities.
      (53)    "Wastewater" means any waste and water, whether treated or
untreated, that is discharged into, or permitted to enter, a Village sewer.
      (54)    "Watercourse" means a channel in which a flow of water occurs,
either continuously or intermittently. (Ord. 1979-5. Passed 5-14-79.)
925.02 USER CHARGE SYSTEM.
   (a)    The Village does hereby establish a user charge system for the
purposes as described herein:
      (1)    Developing a common and equitable operation, maintenance and
replacement charge, per unit of normal strength wastewater, for all users of
the Village wastewater collection and treatment facilities.
      (2)    Establishing a common and equitable surcharge for extra strength
wastewater based on BOD and SS discharges and characteristics of flow.
      (3)    Insuring that all users share the economies of scale and that
discounts are not given for volume of contribution.
      (4)    Establishing a system that identifies and isolates, as a minimum:
         A.    Costs for treatment;
         B.    Costs for interceptor and/or collector system maintenance;
         C.    Costs for services provided;
         D.    Costs for the administration, operation and maintenance of the
facilities; and
         E.    Separate and distinct elements for other charges such as debt
service and local capital costs.
      (5)    Insuring that the user charge system provides sufficient revenues
to offset any and all actual costs for the operation and maintenance of such
facilities.
      (6)    Insuring that any other political jurisdictions within the service
area of such facilities will adopt, implement and enforce the user charge
system as established herein.
   (b)    The Village does hereby establish that there shall be five classes of
users of the Village wastewater collection and treatment facilities, as
follows:
      (1)    "Domestic" means any single-family residence, or equal, user of
the Village-owned wastewater collection and treatment facilities.
      (2)    "Commercial" means a class of user who normally contributes
primarily segregated domestic wastes, or wastes from sanitary conveniences,
into the Village-owned wastewater facilities; who contributes 25,000 gallons
per day or less of sanitary waste, or a volume of process waste, or combined
sanitary and process wastes, equivalent to 25,000 gallons per day of sanitary
waste (see Section
925.01(a)(44)).
      (3)    "Industrial" means any nongovernmental user of the Village-owned
wastewater collection and treatment facilities which discharges more than
25,000 gallons per day of sanitary waste, or a volume of process waste, or
combined sanitary and process waste, equivalent to 25,000 gallons per day of
sanitary waste.
      (4)    "Institutional" means a class of user who contributes primarily
segregated domestic wastes, or wastes from sanitary conveniences, into the
Village-owned collection and treatment facilities; generally identified as
hospitals, sanitariums, prisons, etc., may be excluded from the requirements of
industrial cost recovery.
      (5)    "Governmental" means a class of user who usually contributes
primarily segregated domestic wastes, or wastes from sanitary conveniences,
into the Village-owned wastewater collection and treatment facilities; may be
excluded from the requirements of industrial cost recovery. As applied herein,
a municipality is defined as a village, town, city, county, district,
association or other public body (including an intermunicipal agency of two or
more of the foregoing entities) created by, or pursuant to, State law, having
jurisdiction over disposal of sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes, or a
designated and approved management agency under Section 208 of the Act;
excludes special districts such as school districts, which do not have as one
of its principal responsibilities, the treatment, transport or disposal of
liquid wastes.
   (c)    The Village does hereby establish that, unless otherwise amended,
added to and/ or deleted from, as provided herein, the following shall be
considered as being the average residential waste discharge in the Village
sewer service area: An average flow of 100 gallons per day at a loading of 200
milligrams per liter of BOD and 250 milligrams per liter of SS per capita.
   (d)    The Village does hereby establish that the Village user charge
system, based on actual use, shall also meet the following requirements:
      (1)    For the first year of operation under the provisions of the
Federal grant, operation and maintenance charges shall be based upon past
experience of the Village.
      (2)    The Village shall review annually the wastewater contribution of
users and user classes, the total costs of operation and maintenance of the
treatment facilities, and the Village user charge system, and annually as may
be required, revise the charges for users or user classes to accomplish the
following:
         A.    Maintain the proportional distribution of operation and
maintenance costs among users and user classes as required herein.
         B.    Generate sufficient revenue to pay the total operation and
maintenance costs necessary to the proper operation and maintenance, including
replacement of the treatment facilities.
         C.    Apply excess revenues collected from a class of users to the
costs of operation and maintenance, including replacement, attributable to that
class for the next year, and adjust the rate accordingly.
      (3)    The user charge system hereby provides that each user which
discharges any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the cost of managing
the effluent or the sludge in the Village's wastewater treatment facilities
shall pay for such increased costs.
      (4)    The user charge system hereby provides that the costs of operation
and maintenance for all flow not directly attributable to users, i.e.,
infiltration/ inflow, shall be distributed among all users of the Village
wastewater facilities in the same manner that it distributes the costs of
operation and maintenance among users or user classes for their actual use.
      (5)    The user charge system hereby provides that the Village shall
notify each user, at least annually, with a regular bill or through public
notice, of the rate and that portion of the user charges which are attributable
to wastewater treatment services. Public notice shall be in accordance with the
laws of the State.
      (6)    The user charge system hereby disregards any terms or conditions
of agreements or contracts between the Village and users, of all classes, which
address the reservation of capacity in the Village's wastewater facilities or
the charges to be collected by the Village in providing wastewater treatment
services and which are inconsistent with the requirements of the “Act”.
      (7)    The user charge system hereby requires nonresidential users of the
Village wastewater treatment facilities to pay the same rate per volume of
wastewater as that paid by residential users.
      (8)    The user charge system hereby requires nonresidential users of the
Village wastewater treatment facilities to comply with the requirements of this
chapter, as those requirements apply to residential users.
         (Ord. 1979-5. Passed 5-14-79.)
925.03 INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY SYSTEM.
   (a)    The Village does hereby establish an industrial cost recovery system
for the purpose of recovering, by the Village, from industrial users of the
Village wastewater treatment facilities, each industrial user's share of the
Federal grant amount allocable to the treatment of waste from such users; and
from commercial users of individual systems, each such user's share of the
Federal grant amount allocable to the treatment of waste from such user.
   (b)    The strength of the average residential waste discharge, having been
established in Section
925.02(c), shall be applied in determining equivalent volumes of process waste
or combined discharges of sanitary and process wastes for the purposes of
industrial cost recovery.
   (c)    The Approving Authority of the Village shall determine the identity
of industrial users of the Village wastewater treatment facilities by:
      (1)    Conducting, initially and on an annual basis, a review of the
accounts of Village water users whose metered water supply records indicate
that 25,000 gallons per day, or more, of water is drawn by such user.
      (2)    Inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, and testing,
initially and on an annual basis, determine the volumes of flow and equivalent
volumes of process waste or combined discharges of sanitary and process waste
contribution of such industrial users.
   (d)    Those persons determined to be industrial users, under the provisions
of these regulations, shall be required to participate in the industrial cost
recovery program.
   (e)    The Village industrial cost recovery program shall be in full force
and effect for a period equal to thirty years or to the useful life of the
treatment facilities, whichever is less.
   (f)    Except as otherwise provided by the Act, those industries required to
participate in the Village's industrial cost recovery program shall be required
to make payment to such program no less often than annually. The first payment
by an industrial user shall be made not later than one year after the user
begins use of the treatment facilities.
   (g)    Those industrial users entering into an agreement with the Village to
reserve a certain capacity in the treatment facilities, shall make industrial
cost recovery payments based on the total reserved capacity in relation to the
design capacity of such facilities. If the discharge of an industrial user
exceeds the reserved capacity in volume, strength or delivery flow rate
characteristics, the user's industrial cost recovery payment shall be increased
to reflect the actual use of the treatment facilities. If there is no agreement
between the industrial user and the Village regarding reserve capacity, and
there is a substantial change in the strength, volume or delivery flow rate
characteristics of an industrial user's discharge, such user's share shall be
adjusted proportionately.
   (h)    If there is an upgrading of the treatment facilities, each existing
industrial user's share shall be adjusted proportionately.
   (i)    If there is an expansion of the treatment facilities, each industrial
user's share shall be adjusted proportionately, except that a user with
reserved capacity under subsection (g) hereof, shall incur no additional
industrial cost recovery charge unless the user's actual use exceeds its
reserved capacity.
   (j)    The basis of design for each unit operation and the cost identified
with each unit of operation shall form the basis of the industrial cost
recovery charges. The major unit operation and basis of design are identified
as:
Design Parameter             Process Unit(s)
Flow                         Grit chamber - chlorination -
                             flow cascade - effluent pumps
Solids                       Comminution - sludge pumping - digesters
Solids identified as grit    Grit conveyor and handling
Flow and solids              Primary setting
Organic and nitrogen loading RBC tanks and aeration equipment
Flow and phosphate removal   Tertiary sand filters - secondary setting
Flows, solids and organics   Control building laboratory
The remaining capital expenditures not identified under a major unit process
shall be proportioned in the same ratios as the totals for the major unit
processes. The industries' industrial cost recovery charge shall then be
calculated on the basis of its contribution of each of the three design
parameters (flow, BOD and SS) multiplied by the parameter's unit cost. Such
calculations supportive of the industrial cost recovery charge shall be filed
at the office of the Mayor.
(Ord. 1979-5. Passed 5-14-79.)
925.04 SEWER REVENUE FUND.
   The funds received from the collection of rates and charges established by
the Village shall be deposited, as received, with the Clerk-Treasurer, who
shall keep the same in a separate fund designated "Sewer Revenue Fund". Subject
to the provisions of any ordinance or indenture of mortgage authorizing the
issuance of and securing mortgage revenue bonds for the wastewater collection
and treatment facilities, moneys in the Sewer Revenue Fund shall be used for
the payment of the cost and expense of operation, maintenance, replacement,
repair, administration and management of such facilities and for the payment of
debt charges on bonds issued for extensions and improvements of such
facilities. Any surplus in the Sewer Revenue Fund over and above the
requirements heretofore mentioned may be used for upgrading, expansion or any
replacements to the facilities and parts thereof.

discharged to storm sewers, combined sewers or natural outlets upon the
approval of the approving authority.
   (c)    The following described substances, materials, waters or wastes shall
be limited in discharges to the Village wastewater systems to concentrations or
quantities which will not endanger lives, limb, public property; will not harm
either the sewers, treatment process or equipment; will not have an adverse
effect on the receiving stream; or otherwise constitute a nuisance. The
approving authority of the Village may set limitations lower than the
limitations established herein, if in its opinion such more severe limitations
are necessary to meet the required objectives. In forming its opinion as to the
acceptability, the approving authority will give consideration to such factors
as the quantity of subject waste in relation to flows and velocities in the
sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment
process employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment plant, degree of
treatability of the waste in the wastewater treatment facility, and other
pertinent factors. The limitations or restrictions on materials or
characteristics of waste or wastewater discharged to the sanitary sewer, which
shall not be violated without approval of the approving authority, are as
follows:
      (1)    Wastewater having a temperature higher than 180 degrees
Fahrenheit.

slug.
      (9)    Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
      (10)    Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or
wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form suspended
solids which interfere with the collection system or create a condition
deleterious to structures and treatment processes.
   (d)    If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged, to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or
possess the characteristics enumerated in this section, and which in the
judgment of the approving authority may have a deleterious effect upon the
wastewater facilities, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which
otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
approving authority may:
      (1)    Reject the wastes; or
      (2)    Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers; or
      (3)    Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      (4)    Require payment to cover added costs of handling and treating the
wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges.
   When considering the above alternatives, the approving authority shall give
consideration to the economic impact of each alternative on the discharger. If
the approving authority permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste
flows, the design and installation of the plant and equipment shall be subject
to the review and approval of the approving authority.
   (e)    Grease, oil and sand traps shall be provided when, in the opinion of
the approving authority, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid
wastes containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable
wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such traps shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All traps shall be of a
type and capacity approved by the approving authority, and shall be located as
to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the
maintaining of these traps, the owner shall be responsible for the proper
removal and disposal by appropriate means, of the captured material and shall
maintain records of the dates, and means of disposal, which are subject to
review by the approving authority. Any removal and hauling of the collected
materials not performed by owner personnel shall be performed by currently
licensed waste disposal firms.

   (a)    Each person who discharges industrial wastes to a Village sewer
shall, within sixty days of receipt of official notice by the approving
authority, prepare and file with the approving authority, a report that shall
include pertinent data relating to the quantity and characteristics of the
wastes discharged to the Village wastewater treatment facilities. Similarly,
each person desiring to make a new connection to the public sewer for the
purpose of discharging industrial wastes shall prepare and file with the
approving authority, a report that shall include actual or predicted data
relative to the quantity and characteristics of the waste to be discharged.
   (b)    When it can be demonstrated that circumstances exist which would
create an unreasonable burden on the person to comply with the above time
schedule, a request for extension of time may be presented for consideration by
the approving authority who may, if warranted, issue an extension of time.
   (c)    Each person discharging industrial wastes into a public sewer shall
construct and maintain one or more control manholes or access points to
facilitate observation, measurement and sampling of his wastes, including
domestic sewage. Control manholes or access facilities shall be located and
built in a manner acceptable to the approving authority. If measuring devices
are to be permanently installed, they shall be of a type acceptable to the
approving authority. Control manholes, access facilities and related equipment
shall be installed by the person discharging the waste, at his expense, and
shall be maintained by such person so as to be in safe condition, accessible
and in proper operating condition at all times. Plans for the installation of
the control manhole or access facilities and related equipment shall be
approved by the approving authority prior to beginning construction.
   (d)    The volume of flow used for computing industrial waste surcharges
shall be the metered water consumption of the person as shown in the record of
meter readings maintained by the Village. If the person discharging industrial
wastes into the public sewers procures any part, or all, of his water from
sources other than the Village, all or a part of which is discharged into the
Village sewers, the person shall install and maintain at his expense, water
meters of a type approved by the approving authority for the purpose of
determining the volume of water obtained from these other sources.
   (e)    Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged to the public
sewer may be required by the approving authority if these volumes cannot
otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records of the
Village. Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the person, at his expense. Following
approval for the installation of such devices, and installation, such devices
may not be removed without the consent of the approving authority.
   (f)    Industrial wastes discharged into the Village sewers shall be subject
to periodic inspection and a determination of character and concentration of
such wastes. The determinations shall be made as often as may be deemed
necessary by the approving authority. Samples shall be collected in such a
manner as to be representative of the composition of the wastes. The sampling
may be accomplished either manually or by the use of mechanical equipment
acceptable to the approving authority. Installation, operation and maintenance
of the sampling facilities shall be the responsibility of the person
discharging the waste and shall be subject to the approval of the approving
authority. Access to sampling locations shall be granted to the approving
authority or its duly authorized representatives at all times. Every care shall
be exercised in the collection of samples to insure their preservation in a
state comparable to that at the time the sample was taken.
   (g)    Laboratory procedures used in the examination of industrial wastes
shall be those set forth in "Standard Methods", Section
145. However, alternate methods for certain analysis of industrial wastes may
be used subject to mutual agreement between the approving authority and the
person. Determination of the character and concentration of the industrial
wastes shall be made by the person discharging them, or his agent, as
designated by the approving authority. The Village may also make its own
analysis of the wastes and these determinations shall be binding as a basis for
charges.
(Ord. 1979-5. Passed 5-14-79.)
925.11 INDUSTRIAL WASTE SURCHARGES.
   (a)    All persons discharging industrial wastes into the Village sewers
shall be subjected to a surcharge, in addition to any other sewer service
charges, if those wastes have a concentration greater than the concentrations
established in Section
925.02(c). The amount of surcharge shall reflect the cost incurred by the
Village in removing the excess BOD and SS. This surcharge shall include a
proportionate share of the overall fixed charges for the wastewater treatment
facilities based upon an average useful life of thirty years, or at the end of
major construction periods, whichever is shorter; and the annual cost of
operation and maintenance of the treatment facilities.
   (b)    The excess pounds of BOD and SS shall be computed by multiplying the
person's sewage flow volume in million gallons per day by the constant 8.345
and then multiplying this product by the difference between the person's
concentrations of BOD and SS and the concentrations established in Section
925.02(c) in milligrams per liter. The surcharge for each constituent shall
then be determined by multiplying the excess pounds of each constituent by the
appropriate rate of surcharge listed in subsection (c) hereof. This product
will then be multiplied by the number of days in the billing period to
determine the surcharge. Concentration figures in the above calculations shall
be daily averages determined in accordance with the provisions of Section
925.10.
   (c)    The rates of surcharge for each of the aforementioned constituents
shall be as follows:
      (1)    For biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), eleven cents (11¢) per pound;
      (2)    For suspended solids (SS), thirteen cents (13¢) per pound.
   (d)    The rates of surcharge shall be reviewed annually by the approving
authority to determine whether or not they are sufficient to defray the fixed
charges, amortization costs, and annual cost of operation and maintenance,
including replacement, as determined from the wastewater treatment facilities
records. If the difference between the revenue derived from the rates of
surcharge and the total annual cost is sufficient to justify an increase or
decrease in the rates, the approving authority shall make such recommendation
as is appropriate to Council.
(Ord. 1979-5. Passed 5-14-79.)
925.12 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The approving authority shall make and enforce such rules and regulations as
may be deemed necessary for the enforcement of the provisions hereof, for the
proper determination and collection of the rates and charges, and for the safe,
efficient and economical management of the Village wastewater collection and
treatment facilities. Such rules and regulations, when not repugnant to
existing ordinances of the Village, or laws of the State, shall have the same
force and effect as ordinances of Council.
(Ord. 1979-5. Passed 5-14-79.)
925.13 REMEDIES FOR NONPAYMENT.
   (a)    Such charges and surcharges levied in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter shall be a debt due to the Village and shall be a
lien upon the property. If this debt is not paid to the Village within thirty
days after it shall be due and payable, it shall be deemed delinquent and may
be recovered by civil action in the name of the Village against the property
owner, the person, or both.
   (b)    In the event of failure to pay such charges or surcharges after they
become delinquent, the Village shall have the right to discontinue water
service, or to remove or close sewer connections and enter upon the property
for accomplishing such purposes. The expense of such discontinuance, removal or
closing, as well as the expense of restoring service, shall likewise be a debt
due to the Village and a lien upon the property and may be recovered by civil
action in the name of the Village against the property owner, the person, or
both.
   (c)    Water or sewer service shall not be restored until all charges,
including the expense of removal, closing and restoration, shall have been paid
by the person to the Village.
   (d)    Change of ownership or occupancy of the premises found delinquent
shall not be cause for reducing or eliminating the penalties established
herein.
(Ord. 1979-5. Passed 5-14-79.)
925.14 PROTECTION FROM DAMAGE.
   No person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage,
destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or
equipment which is a part of the wastewater collection and treatment
facilities. Whoever violates this section shall be subject to immediate arrest
under the charge of misdemeanor.

the revelation to the public of the information in question might result in an
advantage to competitors.
   (c)    While performing official work on private properties, the approving
authority or other duly authorized employees of the Village shall observe all
safety rules applicable to the premises established by the person, and the
person shall be held harmless for injury or death to the Village employees, and
the Village shall indemnify the person against loss or damage to such property
by Village employees and against liability claims and demands for personal
injury or property damage asserted against the person and growing out of the
gauging and sampling operation, except as such may be caused by negligence or
failure of the person to maintain safe conditions as required herein.
   (d)   The approving authority and other duly authorized employees of the
Village bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to
enter all private properties through which the Village holds a duly negotiated
easement for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection, observation,
measurement, sampling, repair, and maintenance of any portion of the wastewater
facilities lying within such easement. All entry and subsequent work, if any,
on such easement shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the duly
negotiated easement pertaining to the private property involved. (Ord. 1979-5.
Passed 5-14-79.)
925.16 APPEALS.

herein shall be governed by applicable laws regulating appeals boards.
(Ord. 1979-5. Passed 5-14-79.)
925.17 MONTHLY ASSESSMENT FOR STORM SEWER USE.
   An assessment of two dollars ($2.00) shall be added to the billings of each
sewer account per month effective January 02, 2004, and shall be reflected on
each account on the first billing as authorized by law and shall continue until
order of the Council of the Village of Carrollton. (Ord. 2003-29. Passed 12-22-

1105.01  CONSULTATION.
   Before preparing and submitting a preliminary plat to the Planning
Commission, the subdivider or his engineer shall consult with the Commission
while the plat is in sketch form, to ascertain the location of proposed
highways, primary or secondary streets, parkways, parks, playgrounds, school
sites and other planned developments and to acquaint himself with the
Commission’s requirements. Where a large scale project is contemplated, the
subdivider shall also submit a master plan for the entire project area, even
though the land to be platted immediately represents only a portion of the
total area.
(Ord. 1973-10. Passed 1-8-74.)
1105.02  FILING.
   The subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision
which shall conform with the requirements set forth in these Regulations and
shall file with the Clerk an application in writing for approval of such plat
accompanied by at least four black line or blue line prints and one
reproducible tracing on cloth or mylar type material, accurately drawn to a
scale of 100 feet to the inch or larger scale on one or more sheets of twenty-
four by thirty-six or twenty-two by thirty-four inches in size. Filing shall be
made at least fifteen working days prior to the meeting of the Planning
Commission at which the plat is first considered. Within two working days after
the filing, the Clerk shall place one copy of the preliminary plat in a
permanent file and distribute the remaining copies to the Village Administrator
for approval, the Engineer for approval, and other appropriate agencies for
review and comment.
(Ord. 2001-17. Passed 5-14-01.)
1105.03  CONTRACT OF SALE PRIOR TO PRELIMINARY PLAT.
   No person, firm or corporation, proposing to make or having made a
subdivision within jurisdiction of these Regulations shall enter into any
contract for the sale of, or shall offer to sell any subdivision or any part
thereof, or shall proceed with any construction work on such proposed
subdivision, including grading, until he or it has obtained from the Planning
Commission, the approval of the preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision.
(Ord. 1973-10. Passed 1-8-74.)
1105.04 AREAS SUBJECT TO FLOODING.
   In order to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the people,
the Planning Commission will reject any proposed subdivision located in an area
subject to periodic flooding. Whenever a subdivision is proposed to be located
in an area having poor drainage or other adverse physical characteristics, the
Commission may approve the plat, provided the subdivider legally binds himself
to make such improvements as, in the judgment of the Engineer, will render the
subdivision safe and acceptable for the intended use. In this case, the
subdivider shall post a surety performance bond sufficient to cover the cost of
such improvements as estimated by the official having jurisdiction.
(Ord. 1973-10. Passed 1-8-74.)
1105.05 FILING FEE.
   (a)   Upon filing a preliminary plat for a subdivision, the subdivider shall
pay the sum of ten dollars ($10.00) for a subdivision containing not more than
two lots; twenty dollars ($20.00) for a subdivision containing three to five
lots; and for a subdivision containing six or more lots, the fee shall be
twenty dollars ($20.00) plus two dollars ($2.00) for each additional lot over
five in the proposed subdivision, such fee to be applicable as the land
subdivision permit fee required by the provisions of these Regulations. The
amount shall not be returned to the subdivider upon failure to meet the
requirements of these Regulations or failure to submit a final plat in proper
form. The fee shall be used for the purpose of providing funds for
administrative costs incidental to processing of the plat by Council, the
Planning Commission and their officers or employees.
   (b)   The subdivider shall pay such additional costs necessary to provide
for plat or plan review, including, but not limited to, engineering, planning
and architectural costs and expenses. (Ord. 1973-10. Passed 1-8-74.)

utilities.
   (e)    Street Names. Streets that are obviously in alignment with others
already existing and named shall bear the names of the existing streets. Street
names shall not be duplicated within the County. (Ord. 1973-10. Passed 1-8-74.)
1105.08 APPROVAL BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)    The preliminary plat shall be deemed submitted to the Planning
Commission at its first regular meeting scheduled not less than fifteen working
days following the filing of such plat with the Clerk as provided.
   (b)    The Planning Commission shall approve such plat at their next regular
meeting, or shall disapprove the same. The failure of the Commission to approve
or disapprove a plat within the time herein fixed or such further time as the
applying party may agree to, shall constitute approval of the plat by the
Commission. The certificate of the Secretary of the Commission as to the date
of the submission of the plat for approval and the failure to take action
thereon within such time, shall be issued on demand and shall be sufficient in
lieu of the written endorsement of approval required by this section.
   (c)    The approval of the preliminary plat does not constitute an
acceptance of the subdivision, but merely authorizes the developer to proceed
with work on the final plat. One copy of the approved preliminary plat, signed
by the Chairman of the Board of Public Affairs, Chairman of the Planning
Commission, and the Mayor, shall be retained in the office of the Clerk. One
signed copy shall be given to the subdivider.
   (d)    Receipt of such signed copy is authorization for the subdivider to
proceed with the preparation of detailed plans and specifications for the
minimum improvements required in these Regulations, and with the preparation of
the final plat. Prior to the construction of any improvements required or to
the submission of any bond, the subdivider shall furnish the Council all plans,
information and data necessary for such improvements. These plans shall be
examined by Council and will be approved if in accordance with the requirements
of these Regulations. Following this approval, construction can be started or
the amount of a bond determined, as provided.
(Ord. 1973-10. Passed 1-8-74.)
1105.09 DISAPPROVAL BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)    If the Planning Commission disapproves such plat, it shall enter in
its minutes the reason for such disapproval, including citation of or reference
to the rule or regulation violated by such plat. The subdivider may thereafter
make such changes as he deems necessary to conform the plat to the rules and
regulations and resubmit the same as revised to the Commission for approval or
disapproval, which revised plat shall be processed within the times and in the
manner provided in this section.
   (b)    Within sixty days after the disapproval of a plat by the Planning
Commission, or within sixty days after its disapproval of a revised plat, if a
revised plat shall have been submitted, the person submitting such plat may
file a petition in the Court of Common Pleas of Ohio, as provided in Ohio R.C.
711.09.
(Ord. 1973-10. Passed 1-8-74.)
1105.10 APPROVAL BY COUNCIL.
   Upon approval of a preliminary plat, the Planning Commission shall certify
one copy thereof to Council for approval or disapproval. Failure of Council to
approve or disapprove the preliminary plat at the next regular meeting
occurring more than ten days following certification of such plat to Council
shall be deemed to constitute approval of the preliminary plat by Council,
unless a further delay is agreed to by the subdivider. Approval by Council of
the preliminary plat shall constitute approval of the layout of the streets and
public grounds shown thereon, and shall evidence Council's intention to accept
the dedication of the same upon approval by the Commission of the final plat.
Council's approval shall confer upon the subdivider the right for a one year
period from the date of approval that the general terms and conditions under
which the preliminary approval was granted will not be affected by any changes
and/or amendments to these Regulations.
(Ord. 1973-10. Passed 1-8-74.)
1105.11 APPROVAL WITHOUT PLAT.
   If the Planning Commission is satisfied that the proposed subdivision is not
contrary to applicable platting, subdivision or zoning regulations, it may
approve such subdivision and stamp the deed "Approved by the Planning
Commission of the Village of Carrollton, Ohio, No Plat Required ".
1105.12 ACCEPTANCE OF STREETS.
   (a)    All plats of proposed allotments must be submitted to the Planning
Commission and recommended by the Planning Commission to Council. Acceptance of
plats of proposed allotments and the acceptance of streets can only be done by
Council.
   (b)    The Village Engineer shall not approve a plat constituting an
acceptance of a street for public use by the Village as provided in Ohio R.C.
711.091 until such time as Council has enacted an ordinance accepting such
street or streets for public use by the Village.
1105.13 WORK ON UNAPPROVED SUBDIVISION.
   No owner or agent of the owner of any land within the jurisdiction of these
Subdivision Regulations shall proceed with any work on a proposed subdivision,
including grading, which may affect the arrangement of streets, utilities or
change the natural course of surface drainage, until he has obtained tentative
approval of the proposed subdivision plat and has met the other requirements
herein set forth.
1105.14 POLICY ON PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   The Village hereby defines its policy to be that the Village will withhold
all public improvements of whatsoever nature, including the maintenance of
streets and the furnishing of sewerage facilities and water service from all
subdivisions which have not been approved, from all areas dedicated to the
public which have not been accepted by Council in the manner prescribed herein.

1107.01 REQUIRED; FILING.
   Upon completion of all improvements or posting of appropriate bonds as
required by these Regulations, the subdivider shall file the final plat with
the Clerk at least fifteen working days before the Planning Commission meeting.
The final plat of any portion of a larger subdivision, the preliminary plat of
which has been approved by the Commission, may be submitted for approval.
Completion of improvements, or the giving of security therefor, need only cover
that portion of the plat for which final approval is requested. Within two
working days after the filing, the Clerk shall place one copy of the final plat
in a permanent file and distribute the remaining copies to the Engineer for
approval and the Village Administrator for approval and other appropriate
agencies for review and comment.
(Ord. 1973-10. Passed 1-8-74.)
1107.02 PARK FEES.
   The owner of each new subdivision as a prerequisite to the approval of the
final plat thereof, shall pay a park and playground fee into the Park and
Playground Fund of the Village. Such fee shall be computed as follows:
   (a)    The sum of forty dollars ($40.00) for each dwelling unit permitted to
be constructed thereon under applicable regulations of the Zoning Ordinance.
For each lot or parcel intended for commercial, office or other business use,
an amount computed at the rate of four hundred dollars ($400.00) for each acre
of such lot or parcel. The Park and Playground Fund shall be used for the
acquisition or improvement of municipal parks and playgrounds exclusively, and
for no other purpose.
   (b)    In lieu of payment of the above park and playground fee, Council on
recommendation of the Planning Commission may accept the dedication for public
park and playground use, open spaces constituting not less than fifteen percent
(15%) of the gross acreage of the subdivision, suitably located and of adequate
size; provided, however, that in no event shall the aggregate value of such
dedicated land be less than the equivalent park and playground fee otherwise
payable and computed in accordance with the above established formula. (Ord.
1973-10. Passed 1-8-74.)
1107.03 CHECKING AGAINST PRELIMINARY PLAT; CERTIFICATION.
   Within five days after the final plat has been filed, a copy thereof shall
be transmitted to the Engineer, who will check such plat to determine if the
final plat conforms to the preliminary plat as approved. If such final plat
does so conform, the Engineer shall forward such plat to the Village
Administrator together with a certificate showing that the technical details of
the plat have been checked and that such final plat conforms in all essential
respects to the preliminary plat, and that all required improvements have been
satisfactorily completed, or that security has been given for the making of
such improvements, as provided by these Regulations. Following their approval
and designation of such by signature of the Chairman, the Village Administrator
shall forward the final plat to the Commission.
(Ord. 1973-10. Passed 1-8-74.)
1107.04 APPROVAL.
   At the first meeting of the Planning Commission after a copy of the final
plat, together with the Engineer's certificate and the approval of the Village
Administrator has been received by the Commission, the Commission shall approve
the final plat and the Chairman of the Commission shall endorse such approval
on the plat. Failure of the Commission to approve or disapprove the plat within
the time fixed or such further time as the applying party may agree to, shall
constitute approval of the plat, and the certificate of the secretary of the
Commission as to the date of submission of the plat for approval and the
failure to take action thereon shall be issued on demand and shall be
sufficient in lieu of the written endorsement of approval. If the Commission
disapproves the final plat, it shall enter in its minutes the reason for such
disapproval.
(Ord. 1973-10. Passed 1-8-74.)
1107.05 COUNCIL ACCEPTANCE OF PLAT.
   Within five days after the Planning Commission has approved the final plat,
the plat shall be transmitted to Council, together with all certificates and
endorsements herein required. Council shall approve the plat at its next
regular meeting occurring five days or more following the transmission of the
plat to it. Approval of the plat by Council shall be deemed to constitute
acceptance of the public way or space shown on such plat. Failure of Council to
act within the prescribed time, unless an extension of time is agreed to by the
subdivider shall constitute approval of the plat.
(Ord. 1973-10. Passed 1-8-74.)
1107.06 BOND REQUIREMENTS.
   The final plat in ink on tracing cloth or mylar material and five black line
or blue line prints thereof, together with copies of deed restrictions and two
copies of certified plans showing the improvements that are to be constructed

the Engineer that the balance remaining after such payments will, in his
opinion, be adequate to pay the remaining costs of such improvements.

1127.01 BUILDING PERMIT.
   (a)    When Required. No person shall construct, alter, repair, remove or
demolish or commence the construction, alteration, removal or demolition of a
building or structure without first filing with the Building Inspector an
application in writing and obtaining a formal permit.
   (b)    Form. An application for a permit shall be submitted in such form as
the Building Inspector may prescribe. Such application shall be made by the
owner or lessee, or agent of either, or the architect, engineer, or building
contractor employed in connection with the proposed work. If such application
is made by a person other than the owner in fee, it shall be accompanied by a
duly verified affidavit of the owner in fee, or the person making the
application that the proposed work is authorized by the owner in fee and that
the person making the application is authorized to make such application. Such
application shall contain the full names and addresses of the applicant and of
the owner, and, if the owner is a corporate body, of its responsible officers.
Such application shall describe briefly the proposed work and shall give such
additional information as may be required by the Building Inspector for an
intelligent understanding of the proposed work. Such application shall be
accompanied by payment of such fees as Council may determine from time to time.
   (c)    Plans. Application for permits shall be accompanied by such drawings
of the proposed work, drawn to scale, including such floor plans, sections,
elevations and structural details as the Building Inspector may require.
   (d)    Plot Diagram. There shall also be filed a plot diagram in a form and
size suitable for filing permanently with the permit record, drawn to scale,
with all dimensions figured, showing accurately the size and exact location of
all proposed new construction, or in the case of demolition, of such
construction as is to be demolished, and of all existing buildings, prepared by
and signed by a registered surveyor, engineer or architect. The preparation and
signature of such plot diagram by a surveyor, engineer or architect registered
in the State of Ohio shall only be required for projects whose completion value
exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000).
   (e)    Amendments. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the filing of
amendments to an application or to a plan or other record accompanying same, at
any time before the completion of the work for which the permit was sought.
Such amendments, after approval, shall be filed with and be deemed a part of
the original application.
   (f)    Completion of Existing Buildings. Nothing contained in this Zoning
Ordinance shall require any change in the plans, construction, size or
designated use of a building, for which a valid permit has been issued or
lawful approval given before the effective date of this Ordinance. Construction
under such permit or approval shall have been started within six months and the
ground story framework including structural parts of the second floor shall
have been completed within one year and the entire building completed within
two years after the effective date of this Ordinance.
   (g)    Action on Application. It shall be the duty of the Building Inspector
to examine applications for permits, within a reasonable time after filing. If,
after examination, he finds no objection to the same and it appears that the
proposed work will be in compliance with the laws and ordinances applicable
thereto, he shall approve such application and issue a permit for the proposed
work as soon as practicable. If his examination reveals otherwise, he will
reject such application, noting his finding in a report to be attached to the
application and delivering a copy to the applicant.
   (h)    Approval in Part. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
prevent the Building Inspector from issuing a permit for the construction of
part of a building or structure before the entire plans and detailed statements
of such building or structure have been submitted or approved, if adequate
plans and detailed statements have been presented for the same and have been
found to comply with this Zoning Ordinance.
   (i)    Condition of the Permit. All work performed under a permit issued by
the Building Inspector shall conform to the approved application and plans, and
approved amendments thereof. The location of all new construction as shown on
the approved plot diagram, or an approved amendment thereof, shall be strictly
adhered to. No person shall reduce or diminish the area of a lot or plot of
which a plot diagram has been filed and has been used as the basis for a
permit, unless a revised plot diagram showing the proposed change in conditions
shall have been filed and approved; provided that this shall not apply when the
lot is reduced by reason of a street opening or widening or other public
improvement.
   (j)   Signature to Permit. Every permit issued by the Building Inspector
under the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance shall have his signature affixed
thereto; but this shall not prevent him from authorizing a subordinate to affix
such signature.
   (k)   Limitation. A permit under which no work is commenced within one year
after issuance shall expire by limitation.
   (l)   Posting of Permit. A copy of the permit shall be kept on the premises
open to public inspection during the prosecution of the work and until the
completion of same. The Building Inspector may require a certified copy of the
approved plans to be kept on the premises at all times from the commencement of
the work to the completion thereof. The Building Inspector shall be given at
least twelve hours notice of the starting of work under a permit.
   (m)   Revocation. The Building Inspector may revoke a permit or approval
issued under the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance when he finds there has
been any false statement or misrepresentation as to a material fact in the
application or plans on which the permit or approval was based. (Ord. 1973-9.
Passed 12-17-73.)
1127.02 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.

Occupancy has been issued. Certificate of Occupancy for a new building or the
reconstruction or alteration of an existing building shall be applied for

shall be issued within three days after the request for same shall have been
made in writing to the Building Inspector after the erection or alteration of
such building or part thereof shall have been completed, in conformity with the
provisions of these regulations. Pending the issuance of a regular certificate,
a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued by the Building Inspector
for a period not exceeding one year, during the completion of alterations or
during partial occupancy of a building pending its completion. Such temporary
certificate shall not be construed as in way altering the respective rights,
duties or obligations of the owners or of the tenants relating to the use or
occupancy of the premises or any other matter covered by these regulations, and
such temporary certificate shall not be issued except under such restrictions
and provisions as will adequately insure the safety of the occupants.

laws and ordinances and with the provisions of these regulations. A record of

similar manner in future applications or appeals.

matter in which the Board has original or appellate jurisdiction may be taken
to the Court of Common Pleas of Carroll County, Ohio or such other court of

1141.02 UNCERTAINTY AS TO DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various
districts as shown on the Zoning District Map, the following rules apply:
   (a)    The district boundaries are either streets or alleys, unless
otherwise shown and where the districts designated on the Zoning District Map
accompanying and made a part of this Zoning Ordinance are bounded approximately
by street or alley lines, the street or alley shall be construed to be the
boundary of the district.
   (b)    Where the district boundaries are not otherwise indicated, and where
the property has been or may hereafter be divided into blocks and lots, the
district boundaries shall be construed to be the lot lines, and where the
districts designated on the Zoning District Map accompanying and made a part of
this Zoning Ordinance are bounded approximately by lot lines, the lot lines
shall be construed to be the boundary of the districts unless the boundaries

governed the territory annexed immediately prior to the annexation, as enacted
by a Board of County Commissioners under Ohio R.C. 303.01 to 303.25, or enacted
by a Board of Township Trustees under Ohio R.C. 519.02 to 519.25, as the case
may be, until Council shall either officially adopt the existing zoning
regulations of such county or township or new regulations for such territory.
(Ord. 1973-9. Passed 12-17-73.)
   (b)   All territory annexed shall, at the time of acceptance by Council, set
forth therein a provision providing for the zone designation by which such
territory shall be designated.
   (c)   Any such territory not otherwise designated at the time of annexation,
shall be placed in the RS-1 Residential District until otherwise changed by
ordinance.
   (d)   When the initial request for annexation by the petitioner, or his
agent, is received at the office of the Clerk-Treasurer, it shall be the duty
of the Clerk-Treasurer to advise the petitioner, or his agent, that they may
choose the zone designation they wish the Planning Commission to consider. If
the petitioner, or his agent, requests a zone designation, other than RS-
1 Residential District, it shall be in the form of a letter to Council.
   (e)   At such times as any annexation proceeding is certified to the Clerk-
Treasurer after having been approved by the County Commissioners, notice of the
same shall be given to the Planning Commission and such Commission shall act
upon the same, in the same manner as any zone change request. Notice to the
Planning Commission shall be made by the Clerk- Treasurer within ten days of
the receipt of the resolution of the County Commissioners and the Planning
Commission shall proceed as though a zone request had been filed under Chapter

1183.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish regulations controlling the use
of fences, hedges and walls whereby the lot owner in a residence district may

consideration to the environment of his neighbor, the appearance of the
community and the safety of the public and the individual.
1183.02 SCOPE.
   This chapter shall apply to all residence districts. The fence regulations
herein shall not apply to any permanent fence erected prior to the effective

1183.03 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)    As used in this chapter:
      (1)    "Fence" means any structure composed of wood, iron, steel, tree
row, shrubbery, hedges or other material erected in such a manner and position
as to enclose or partially enclose all or any part of the premises. Trellises
or other structures supporting or for the purpose of supporting vines, flowers,
and other vegetation when erected in such position as to enclose all or any
part of any premises shall be included within the definition of the word "fence
."
Structures erected other than on lot lines or in proximity to lot lines, which
have solely an ornamental purpose and which do not in fact serve the purpose of
enclosing or partially enclosing premises or of separating premises from
adjoining premises, shall not be included within the definition of the word
“fence”.
      (2)    "Privacy fence" means a fence made to inhibit public view and
provide seclusion and, when viewed at right angles, having more than fifty
percent (50%) of the area of its vertical plane (the area within a rectangular

light perpendicular to its vertical plane.
         (3)    "Open ornamental fence" means a fence usually made of wood
constructed for its beauty or decorative effect and, when viewed at right
angles, having not less than fifty percent (50%) of the area of its vertical
plane (the area within a rectangular outline enclosing all parts of the fence
in its vertical plane) open to light and air. Permitted open ornamental fences

Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (a)    Open ornamental fences shall be permitted in public facilities and
residential zoning districts.
      (1)   Front yards. Open ornamental fences may be erected in front yards
parallel to the building line to a height not exceeding three and one-half
feet; provided, however, that rail or split rail fences may be erected in front
yards parallel to and on or approximately on the common property line but

above the natural grade. Such fences shall not allow vines or other sight
inhibitors from blocking the view of traffic.
   (c)   Privacy fences shall be permitted in all zoning districts only in rear
yards. Such fences shall comply with the yard requirements of permitted
accessory building and shall not exceed seven feet in height above the natural
grade.
   (d)   Shrubbery or hedges shall be permitted in public facilities and
residential zoning districts provided they conform to the height and location
requirements of this chapter.
   (e)   Any fence within ten feet in any direction from a point where any
driveway, either on the fence owner’s lot or the adjoining lot, intersects with
the sidewalk shall have a minimum of seventy-five percent (75%) open area.
   (f)   The Building and Zoning Inspector may permit other fences which are
similar in character and design to one or more of the fences permitted herein.
1183.05 RESTRICTIONS.

1183.06 SWIMMING POOLS.
   Swimming pools located within the corporate limits of the Village shall be
surrounded by a fence, not less than four feet in height and all openings,
doorways and entrances into such pool area shall be equipped with gates of
equal height with such fence, which gates shall be provided with latches. Above
ground pools shall have a locking gate and removable ladders. The design of any
pool fence shall be approved by the Building and Zoning Inspector.
(Ord. 2004-13. Passed 8-23-04.)
1183.07 CORNER OR THROUGH LOT.
   Where a rear or side yard abuts a street, fences otherwise permitted in side
or rear yards shall not extend into required yards, provided however, that this
provision shall not prohibit permitted rail or split rail fences erected in
such side or rear yards parallel to and not nearer than one foot to the side or
rear property line, at a height not to exceed three and one half feet above the
natural grade.
1183.08 MAINTENANCE.
   Such permitted fences shall be maintained in good condition, be structurally
sound and attractively finished at all times. Any grounds between such fences
and property lines shall be well maintained at all times. Any such fences
permitted on the property line shall be designed, constructed and finished so
that the supporting members thereof shall face the property of the owner of the
fence.
   
1183.09 PERMIT AND APPEAL.
   (a)   Any fence which may be permitted shall require the issuance of a
permit prior to its erection by the Building and Zoning Inspector after an
application for same has been approved by him.
   (b)   Should the Building and Zoning Inspector fail or refuse to issue a
permit after proper application has been made therefor, a person may appeal the
failure or refusal to the Board of Zoning Appeals. The power to grant variances
to this chapter shall include, but not be limited to, the authority to grant
variances with respect to prohibited fences under Section
1183.05. The person seeking a variance shall follow all rules and Board of
Zoning Appeals procedures currently enforced for granting variances to the
application of the Village Zoning Ordinance, including no such variance shall
be authorized unless a finding is made that all of the following facts and
conditions exist:
      (1)   Exceptional and extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying
to the subject property that do not apply generally to other properties in the
same district or vicinity.
      (2)   The special circumstances or conditions do not result from actions
of the property owner or any of his predecessors in title.
      (3)   Such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right of the applicant possessed by owners of other
properties in the same district or vicinity.
      (4)   The authorization of such variance shall not be materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the district or
vicinity in which the property is located.
1183.10 INSPECTION.
   It shall be the duty of the property owner to determine property lines and
to ascertain that the fence thus constructed does not deviate from the plans as
approved by the Building and Zoning Inspector issuing permits, and such fence
does not encroach upon another lot or parcel of land. The Village shall furnish
such inspection as is deemed necessary to determine that such fence is
constructed in accordance with plans submitted for permit, provided however,
that the issuance of such permit by the Village shall not be construed to mean
the Village has determined such fence is not encroaching upon another lot, nor
shall it relieve the property owner of the duty imposed upon him herein.
1183.11 SPITE FENCES.
   Fences and small incidental structures used for children's recreation shall
not be subject to the requirements for the principal building or the accessory
building, but no "spite fence" shall be erected or maintained. For the purposes
of this Zoning Ordinance, a "spite fence" is any fence of such height or
character as to block access of light and air to any ground floor window or
upper window or to interfere with the reasonable use of a person's property. In
any case, no fence shall be erected higher than five feet.
1183.12 FENCES, HEDGES AND SHRUBBERY.
   No fence or wall serving the purpose of a fence shall be constructed of such
height and in such a location (in the front or side yard) as to interfere with
the safety of vehicular traffic in the streets. Hedges and shrubbery on corner
lots shall be subject to the same regulations as those for fences.
1183.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter shall be guilty of a minor
misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
Each day that such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.

1185.01 MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
   Large-scale residential developments, where permitted, are subject to the
following conditions:
   (a)    The development shall have a minimum area of ten acres.
   (b)    The housing type, minimum lot area, yard, height and accessory uses
shall be determined by the requirements and procedure set out below, which
shall prevail over conflicting requirements of this Zoning Ordinance or the
Subdivision Regulations.
   (c)    The Final Development Plan shall follow all applicable procedures,
standards and requirements of the Subdivision Regulations. The Final
Development Plan shall be prepared by and have the seal of an architect or
engineer duly registered to practice in this State. No building permit shall be
issued until a final plat of the proposed development is approved and recorded.
   (d)    The Planning Commission shall review the conformity of the proposed
development with the standards of the official Village plan and recognized
principles of civic design, land use planning and landscape architecture. The
minimum yard and maximum height requirements of the district in which the
development is located shall not apply except that minimum yards shall be
provided around the boundaries of the area being developed. The Commission may
impose conditions regarding the layout, circulation and performance of the
proposed development and may require that appropriate deed restrictions be
filed enforceable by the Village for a period of twenty years from date of
filing. A plat of development shall be recorded regardless of whether a
subdivision is proposed and such plat shall show building lines, common land,
streets, easements and other applicable features required by the Subdivision
Regulations.
   (e)    The number of dwelling units permitted shall be determined by
dividing the net development area by the minimum lot area per family required
by the district or districts in which the area is located. Net development area
shall be determined by subtracting the area set aside for churches, schools or
other nonresidential uses from the gross development area and deducting twenty
percent (20%) of the remainder for streets, regardless of the amount of land
actually required for streets. The area of land set aside for common open space
or recreational use shall be included in determining the number of dwelling
units permitted. (Ord.1973-9. Passed 12-17-73.)
1185.02 PUBLIC HEARING; APPROVAL.
   The Planning Commission may hold one or more public hearings on a Final
Development Plan. The recommendations of the Commission shall be forwarded to

without modification and after public hearing. After approval by Council and
after any required restrictions are in effect, the Building Inspector may issue
permits enabling the approved Final Development Plan to be carried out. (Ord.
1973-9. Passed 12-17-73.)

1189.01 PURPOSE.
   This chapter creates the legal framework for signage regulations that is
intended to facilitate a lawfully acceptable communication between people. It
recognizes the need to protect safety and welfare of the public, the need for
well maintained and attractive appearance in the Village, and the need for
adequate business identification and advertising and communication. This
section recognizes that aesthetics and design quality cannot be satisfactorily
legislated, as individual opinions vary and local public sentiment vary from
one place and era to another. It is recognized, however, that a great
percentage of that which is unattractive can be eliminated by sensible quality
control, through adequate maintenance and inspection and by reasonable
guidelines formulated to minimize clutter. This chapter intends to achieve the
specific purposes to preserve, protect and promote property values and the
community appearance, and to accommodate legitimate advertising and quality
signage.

   Except as otherwise provided herein, the lawful use of a building existing
at the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance may be continued and expanded by
an amount not to exceed two times its present floor area, although such use
does not conform to the provisions hereof. If no structural alterations are
made, a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming
use of the same or of a more restricted classification. Whenever a
nonconforming use has been changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming
use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted use. The
nonconforming use of a building may be hereafter extended throughout those
parts of a building which were lawfully and manifestly arranged or designed for
such use at the time of the enactment of this Ordinance. (Ord. 1973-9. Passed
12-17-73.)
1191.02 DISCONTINUANCE OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   No building or portion thereof used in whole or in part for a nonconforming
use in a Residential District, which remains idle or unused for a continuous
period of two years, whether or not the equipment or fixtures are removed,
shall again be used except in conformity with the regulations of the
Residential District in which it is located.
(Ord. 1979-7. Passed 6-12-79.)
1191.03 DESTRUCTION OF A NONCONFORMING USE.
   No building which has been damaged by any cause whatsoever to the extent of
more than fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value of the building
immediately prior to damage, shall be restored except in conformity with this
Ordinance, and all rights as a nonconforming use are terminated. If a building
is damaged by less than fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value, it may be
repaired or reconstructed and used as before the time of damage, provided that
such repairs or reconstruction be substantially completed within twelve months
of the date of such damage. (Ord. 1973-9. Passed 12-17-73.)
1191.04 NONCONFORMING ADVERTISING SIGNS.
   All projecting advertising signs in violation of Chapter
1189 hereof shall be removed and such signs brought into conformity with

1189 on or before a date not later than five years from the effective date of
this Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 1973-9. Passed 12-17-73.)

nonconforming uses but shall require a conditional use permit for any
alteration, enlargement or extension.
(Ord. 1973-9. Passed 12-17-73.)
1191.06 INTERMITTENT USE.
   The casual, intermittent, temporary or illegal use of land or buildings
shall not be sufficient to establish the existence of a nonconforming use and
the existence of a nonconforming use on the part of a lot or tract shall not be
construed to establish a nonconforming use on the entire lot or tract.
(Ord. 1973-9. Passed 12-17-73.)
1191.07 EXISTENCE OF A NONCONFORMING USE.
   Whether a nonconforming use exists shall be a question of fact and shall be
decided by the Board of Zoning Appeals after public notice and hearing and in
accordance with the rules of the Board. (Ord. 1973-9. Passed 12-17-73.)
1191.08 NONCONFORMING USES NOT VALIDATED.

Zoning Ordinance repeals shall not be validated by the adoption of this
Ordinance.

premises, leaving the premises in a clean, safe and sanitary condition, and the
cost of such work shall be paid by the Village and the owner of record or
purchaser under a land contract shall be responsible for reimbursement of all
costs associated with such demolition and removal, including any administrative
costs levied by the Village. If the Village is not reimbursed within thirty
days of the demolition and removal the amount thereof shall be certified to the
County Auditor and levied as a special assessment against such property on
which the building or structure or portion thereof had been located and shall
be collected in the manner provided for special assessments. The Village may,
at its discretion, utilize any and all resources within its own means to
demolish and remove any such building, structure or portion thereof.
(Ord. 2014-20. Passed 8-25-14.)
1341.14 UNSAFE CONDITIONS; REPORTS.
   Any owner, manager, lessee or occupant of a building who discovers or who
has reason to believe that there exists on the premises a condition which may
endanger other property or the life or limb of any person, and that such
condition cannot be immediately remedied so as to remove any danger therefrom,
shall, within twenty-four hours after such discovery, report the existence of
such dangerous condition to the Building and Zoning Inspector who shall
forthwith take such steps as may be necessary to protect the public safety and
welfare. If the Inspector cannot be located, such report shall be made to the
Chief of Police. No person who is an owner, manager, lessee or occupant of a
building on which premises such a dangerous condition exists and who knows or
should know of such dangerous condition shall fail to make such report to
either the Inspector or the Chief of Police within twenty-four hours after such

1349.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council for the Village of Carrollton, State of Ohio,
does ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The Village of Carrollton, Ohio has special flood
hazard areas that are subject to periodic inundation, which may result in loss
of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Carrollton, Ohio as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any
additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by Village of Carrollton,
Ohio.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps are adopted:
(Ord. 2007-58. Passed 12-10-07.)
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Carroll County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Carroll County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both
effective June 4, 2010. (Ord. 2010-4. Passed 3-22-10.)
      (2)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Carrollton, Ohio as required by Section
1349.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
      (3)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and / or studies are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations.
Such maps and/or studies are on file at the Office of Regional Planning 119 S.
Lisbon Street, Suite #106, Carrollton, Ohio 44615.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances (resolutions) including subdivision
regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these
regulations and any other ordinance (resolution), the more restrictive shall be
followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or
easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the
regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Carrollton, Ohio, any officer or employee thereof, or
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2007-58. Passed 12-10-07.)
1349.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure:  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal:  A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   Base Flood:  The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE): The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor: See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management): Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill:  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM):  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM):  An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation.  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus 0 feet of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway.  
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard.  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by Village of Carrollton, Ohio's historic preservation program, which program
is certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA):  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR):  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home:  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park:  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27- 01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction:  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Carrollton,
Ohio Flood Insurance Rate Map, August 19, 1985, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor:  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area:  Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction:  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage:  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions, or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance: A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 2007-58. Passed 12-10-07.)
1349.03 ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The Building and Zoning
Inspector is hereby appointed to administer and implement these regulations and

apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1349.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas, and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims. (Ord. 2007-58. Passed 12-10- 07.)

            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these
regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsections (d)(3)A.1. to 11.
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential     deliberations of the Board, but including all documents
presented and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning
Board of Appeals may appeal such decision to the Carroll County Court of Common
Pleas, as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 2007-58. Passed 12-10-07.)

applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit

misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
