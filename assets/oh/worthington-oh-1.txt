EDITOR'S NOTE
 
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

THE CITY OF WORTHINGTON, OHIO
PREAMBLE
   We, the people of the City of Worthington, Ohio, in order to provide a

of local self-government, do hereby adopt for our Municipality the following
Charter.

(Amended November 8, 1960.)
   SECTION 1.02 POWERS.
   The Municipality shall have all powers, general and special, governmental or
proprietary, of local self-government and home rule and all other powers that
may now or hereafter lawfully be possessed or exercised by municipal
corporations under the Constitution and laws of the State of Ohio. All such
powers shall be exercised in the manner prescribed by this Charter, or to the
extent not prescribed herein, then in such manner as the Council may determine,
and only when not prescribed in this Charter or determined by Council, such
powers shall be exercised in such manner as may now or hereafter be provided by
the laws of the State of Ohio.
   SECTION 1.03 INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM.
   Except as limited by this Charter and the laws of the State of Ohio, the
powers of initiative and referendum on all matters upon which the Council is

provided by the laws of the State of Ohio.
   SECTION 1.04 REFERENDUM AND EFFECTIVE DATE ON ZONING ORDINANCES OR OTHER

   (A)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Charter, the power of
referendum on any ordinance or other measure passed by the Council amending the

exercised in the manner provided by the laws of the State of Ohio except that
the petition may be filed upon passage of any ordinance or other measure by
Council and within sixty (60) days following publication in order to afford an
opportunity during the period for the filing of referendum petitions thereon.
   (B)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Charter, no ordinance or
other measure passed by the Council amending the City’s zoning code or changing
zoning for any property in the City shall go into effect until sixty (60) days
following publication in order to afford an opportunity during that period for
the filing of referendum petitions thereon; nor shall any such ordinance or

(Enacted November 3, 2015)
Article II
THE COUNCIL
   SECTION 2.01 POWERS, NUMBER, SELECTION AND TERM.
   Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Charter, all powers of
government and control of the Municipality shall be vested in an elective
Council which shall constitute the governing body of the Municipality and shall
enact ordinances and resolutions and exercise all legislative power and
executive authority, including the determination of general policies, now or
hereafter vested in municipal officials by law and in the Council by this
Charter. The Council shall consist of seven members, elected at large on a
nonpartisan ballot, for four year overlapping terms.
   SECTION 2.02 QUALIFICATIONS.
   All members of Council shall have been residents and qualified electors of
the Municipality continuously for at least two (2) years prior to their
election and shall continue to be residents and qualified electors thereof
throughout their respective terms of office. Except as otherwise provided by
this Charter or by ordinance enacted thereunder, a member of Council shall not
hold any incompatible public office but may be a notary public, a member of the
State or National Guard or of a reserve component of the United States, or may
occupy an office held by virtue of such member being a member of Council. Any
member of Council who shall cease to possess or who violates any of the
qualifications herein provided shall immediately forfeit the office but failure
to maintain such qualifications shall not render void or ineffective any action
of Council in which such member has participated. The Council shall be the
judge of the election and the qualifications, as set forth herein, of its
members. (Amended November 5, 1996.)
   SECTION 2.03 VACANCIES.
   Vacancies in the office of member of Council shall be deemed to occur upon
and as of the time of the presentation of a resignation to the President or
President Pro-tem of Council, the death of a member of Council, a determination
by Council that a member of Council ceases to possess or has violated any of
the qualifications for the office of Council as provided in Sec.
2.02 of this Article, the retirement from office after being recalled as
provided in Sec.
 8.01 of this Charter, or upon removal from office as provided by law. Any
vacancy in the office of Council member shall be filled by the election of a
person qualified as provided in Sec.
2.02 of this Article by a majority of the remaining members of Council. The
person so elected shall serve until the next regular municipal election,
occurring not less than ninety days thereafter when a successor shall be
elected by the electors for the remainder of the unexpired term, if any; if
not, for a full term.
   SECTION 2.04 SALARY.
   The salary of Council members and the President of Council may be
established by non-emergency ordinance one time prior to the general election
held in November 2019. After such one-time increase, the salary of the members
of Council shall be established by non-emergency ordinance, provided that no
salary of a Council member shall be increased during that member's term of
office and no salary shall be decreased during such term of office except with
the consent of such member of Council.
(Amended November 8, 2016)
   SECTION 2.05 PRESIDENT OF COUNCIL, PRESIDENT PRO-TEM OF COUNCIL, MAYOR AND
VICE-MAYOR.
     At its organizational meeting after each election of Council members, the
Council shall elect a President of Council and a President Pro-tem of Council,
from among its members, for a term of two (2) years. The process for such
election may be included in rules adopted by Council pursuant to Section
2.15 of this Charter. The President Pro-tem of Council shall act as President
of Council in the absence of the President of Council.
     At said organizational meeting, the Council shall also elect as Mayor and
Vice-Mayor suitable persons from among citizens of this Municipality, qualified
to serve on Council, for a term of two (2) years. A member of Council may not
be elected either as Mayor or as Vice-Mayor.
     The Mayor shall serve as judge of the Mayor's Court to hear and determine
misdemeanor cases arising under the ordinances of this Municipality, as
provided by the laws of the State, unless and until another and different court
is required by State legislative act. So long as there is a Mayor's Court, the
Mayor and Vice-Mayor shall each be an attorney admitted to the Bar of Ohio and
be in good-standing with the Supreme Court of Ohio. Nothing in this Section
2.05 shall limit the City Council from appointing a magistrate to preside over
Mayor's Court in the absence of the Mayor and Vice-Mayor. City Council shall
establish the qualifications of a magistrate and shall make such appointment by
resolution.
     The Mayor shall further be recognized as the ceremonial head of the
Municipality but shall have no administrative duties. The Vice-Mayor shall act
as Mayor during the absence of the Mayor. A vacancy in the office of Mayor or
Vice-Mayor shall be deemed to occur for the same reasons set forth for a
vacancy in the office of member of Council as provided in Section
2.03 hereof. Upon a vacancy in the office of Mayor, the Vice-Mayor shall serve
for the unexpired term or until a Mayor is elected, whichever first occurs.
(Amended November 8, 2016.)

Mayor's term of office.

title may be read in summary fashion, which shall include the ordinance number
and a succinct description of the action to be considered. Upon its

hereinafter provided, a public hearing date on the ordinance shall be scheduled
for a subsequent regular or special meeting of the Council as it shall
determine. The Clerk of Council shall cause a notice of public hearing on the

a newspaper of general circulation in the Municipality prior to the scheduled
hearing date, and/or posted on at least one electronic medium. Such notice
shall contain the title of the ordinance or a succinct summary of the title,
the time, date, and place of the public hearing, and a statement that the
ordinance is on file for public inspection in the office of the Clerk of
Council. At the public hearing, the ordinance shall be read a second time by
title only, or by a succinct summary of the title only as may be determined by
the President of Council, and, thereafter, the public hearing commenced under
such rules as Council may provide. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the

ordinance. The adoption of an ordinance shall require the affirmative vote of a
majority of the members of Council and the attestation by signature thereon of
the President and the Clerk of Council.
    In addition to those categories of ordinances specifically set forth in
Section
2.19 of this Charter, an ordinance necessary for the immediate preservation of
the public health, safety, and welfare of the Municipality may be passed as an
emergency measure to be immediately effective upon its passage and publication
either: (1) upon introduction, provided the notice of public hearing on the
ordinance is waived and the ordinance is declared to be immediately effective
upon its passage and publication; or (2) at the conclusion of the public
hearing thereon provided the ordinance is declared to be immediately effective
upon its passage and publication. A six-sevenths (6/7) vote of the members of
Council shall be required to waive the waiting period, to declare the immediate
effectiveness of the ordinance, and to pass the ordinance.
(Amended November 8, 2016.)
   SECTION 2.18 PUBLICATION OF ORDINANCES.

above unless a provision of said ordinance provides another method.
(Amended November 8, 2016.)
   SECTION 2.19 EFFECTIVE DATE OF ORDINANCES.

length shall not be required. At least three copies of each code shall be kept
in the office of the Clerk of Council for reference by interested persons and
additional copies be kept available for sale by the Clerk.
   SECTION 2.21 ORDINANCE DETERMINING TO PROCEED WITH PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT; RIGHT
OF REFERENDUM.

or pay for any public improvement, City Council shall pass an “Ordinance
Determining to Proceed” with each public improvement which shall be the only
ordinance that is subject to the filing of a referendum petition on said public
improvement.
   For purposes of this section, “public improvement” means the construction or
reconstruction of any public street, highway, road, alley, bikeway, sidewalk,
waterline, watercourse, storm sewer, sanitary sewer, parking lot, street
lighting, fence, building, structure, or other public facility.
   There shall be no right of referendum on any ordinance related to any public
improvement requested by a petition of property owners as authorized by the
laws of the State; or on any public improvement which is immediately necessary
for the preservation of the public health, safety or welfare and is authorized
by the passage of an emergency ordinance pursuant to Section
 2.17 of the Charter.

         (ORC 1.45)
      (3)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first day and including the last day but in no case
shall such computation of time include Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday on
which City offices are closed.
      (4)   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day which constitutes the
last day for doing such act or before its usual closing time on such day, then
such act may be performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday,
Sunday or a legal holiday. If any legal holiday falls on Sunday, the next
succeeding day is a legal holiday.

otherwise expressly declared in the law giving the authority or inconsistent
with State statute or Charter provisions.
   (f)   Exceptions. The rules of construction shall not apply to any law which
shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when the
subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
 
   101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
 
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
 
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
 
   101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
 
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
 
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
 
   101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
 
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
 
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
 
   101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
 
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
 
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
 
   101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
 
   101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

Appropriation of property - see Ohio R.C. Ch. 163, 719
 
   105.01  LIMITATION AND GENERAL PROCEDURE.
   Property may be appropriated by the City for any public or municipal
purpose, subject only to the limitations imposed by the Constitution of Ohio.
Such appropriation shall be made as herein provided or as otherwise provided by
State general law. By such appropriation, the City may acquire a fee simple
title or any less estate, easement or use as determined to be necessary by
Council.
(Ord. 83-66. Passed 9-26-66.)
 
   105.02  PASSAGE OF RESOLUTION OF INTENT.
   Whenever it is deemed necessary by Council to appropriate private property
for a public purpose, the Council shall pass a resolution declaring its intent
to appropriate such property for a public purpose, defining the purpose of the
appropriation, and setting forth a pertinent description of the land and the
estate or interest therein desired to be appropriated.
(Ord. 83-66. Passed 9-26-66.)
 
   105.03 SERVICE OF RESOLUTION OF INTENT.
   Immediately upon the passage of a resolution under Section
105.02, declaring an intent to appropriate property, the Director of Law shall
cause written notice to be given to the owner of, person in possession of, or
person having an interest of record in every piece of property sought to be
appropriated, or to his authorized agent. Such notice shall be served by a
person designated for the purpose, and return made in the manner provided by
State general law for the service and return of summons in civil actions. If
such owner or agent cannot be found, notice shall be given by publication once
a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City.
(Ord. 83-66. Passed 9-26-66.)
 
   105.04 ORDINANCE TO APPROPRIATE; DETERMINATION OF VALUE; IMMEDIATE
POSSESSION.
   After service of notice of the resolution of intent to appropriate, Council
may pass an ordinance directing the appropriation to proceed. Council shall in
such ordinance make a finding of the necessity of the appropriation and of the
inability of the City and an owner to agree, or that an owner is incapable of
contracting in person or by agent and has no guardian or trustee, or is
unknown, or is not a resident of this State, or his residence is unknown in the
City and cannot with reasonable diligence be ascertained. In such ordinance
Council may fix what is determined to be the value of such property
appropriated together with the damages, if any, to the residue, and may
appropriate such amount to be deposited with the Court of Common Pleas of
Franklin County, for the use and benefit of the owners of the property
appropriated. If Council so fixes the value, as provided herein, and if
possession of the property is necessary prior to assessment of compensation by
a jury, Council shall in such ordinance declare the City's intention and
necessity to obtain immediate possession of the property appropriated. Upon
such deposit with the Court, the City may take possession of and enter upon
such property, including the buildings and structures thereon, for the purposes
for which the property was appropriated, and, if buildings or structures are
located partly upon the land appropriated and partly upon adjoining land, so
that such buildings or structures cannot be divided upon the line between such
lands without manifest injury thereto, the City may enter upon such adjoining
land upon which any part of the buildings or structures are located for the
purpose of removing such buildings or structures.
(Ord. 83-66. Passed 9-26-66.)
 
   105.05 PROCEDURE FOR STRUCTURES TAKEN; APPRAISAL.
   If buildings or structures are located upon the land appropriated, or
located partly upon the land appropriated and partly upon adjoining land so
that such buildings or structures cannot be divided upon the line between such
lands without manifest injury thereto, and such buildings or structures are
removed before the owner accepts the deposit or the jury has fixed the value of
the same, the Director of Law, upon notification from the City Manager that
such buildings or structures are to be removed, shall cause an appraisal to be
made by three persons, one to be appointed by the owner, one by the Director of
Law and one by the County Auditor. Such appraisal may be used as evidence by
either the City or the owner in the trial of the case, but neither the City,
nor the owner, shall be bound by such appraisal. The making of such appraisal
may be waived in writing by the owner. The City Manager shall cause pictures to
be taken of all sides of such building or structure and shall compile a
complete description of such structure for the purpose of perpetuating evidence
of the nature of such structure which may be presented as evidence in the case
by either the City or the owner and to which the owner shall have complete
access.
(Ord. 83-66. Passed 9-26-66.)
 
   105.06 FILING COURT PETITION; ANSWER AND PROCEEDINGS.
   Upon passage of an appropriation ordinance as provided in Section
105.04, the Director of Law shall file a petition with the Court of Common
Pleas of Franklin County, which petition shall describe each parcel of land or
contiguous parcels in a single common ownership, or interest or right therein
sought to be appropriated, such as will permit ready identification of the land
involved; shall contain a statement of the purpose of the appropriation; shall
contain a statement of the estate or interest sought to be appropriated; shall
contain the names and addresses of the owners, so far as they can be
ascertained; shall contain a statement that the City and an owner have been
unable to agree; shall contain a copy of the ordinance of appropriation, or
have a copy attached thereto as an exhibit and incorporated into the petition;
shall contain a prayer for the appropriation; and, if a determination of value
has been made, the petition shall contain the findings of Council of the value
of the property appropriated, and damage, if any, to the residue, and shall
deposit with the Court the amount found by Council to be the value of the
property appropriated, and the damages, if any, to the residue. If no answer is
filed by an owner on or before the third Saturday after the return day of the
summons or service by publication, as provided by State general law, the owners
of the property appropriated will be deemed to have accepted the amount
deposited as full compensation for the taking and the damages, if any, to the
residue, and the title to the property appropriated shall vest in the City for
the purposes for which such property was appropriated. All subsequent
proceedings with regard thereto shall be in the manner provided by State
general law for the appropriation of property by municipal corporations in this
State.

or notices published thereunder. (Ord. 135-75. Passed 1-12-76.)
 
   109.10  EXECUTIVE SESSION.
   Members of the municipal body may hold an executive session only after a
majority of a quorum of the municipal body determines, by a roll call vote, to
hold such a session and only at a regular or special meeting for the sole
purpose of the consideration of the following matters:
   (a)   To consider the appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline,
promotion, demotion, or compensation of a public employee or official, or the
investigation of charges or complaints against a public employee, official,
licensee, or regulated individual, unless the public employee, official,
licensee, or regulated individual requests a public hearing. Except as
otherwise provided by law, the municipal body shall not hold an executive
session for the discipline of an elected official for conduct related to the
performance of the elected official's duties or for the elected official's
removal from office.
   (b)   To consider the purchase of property for public purposes, or for the
sale of property at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of information
would give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a person whose
personal, private interest is adverse to the general public interest. No member
of a public body shall use this division as a subterfuge for providing covert
information to prospective buyers or sellers. A purchase or sale of public
property is void if the seller or the buyer of the public property has received
covert information from a member of the municipal body that has not been
disclosed to the general public in sufficient time for other prospective buyers
and sellers to prepare and submit offers.
   (c)   Conferences with an attorney for the City concerning disputes
involving the City that are the subject of pending or imminent court action.
   (d)   Preparing for, conducting, or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment.
   (e)   Matters required to be kept confidential by Federal law or regulations
or State statutes.
   (f)   Details relative to the security arrangements and emergency response
protocols for the City, if disclosure of the matters discussed could reasonably
be expected to jeopardize the security of the City or of any City office.
   (g)   To consider negotiations for economic development assistance, which
may include information such as marketing plans, specific business strategies,
production techniques, trade secrets, or personal financial statements, or
related to negotiations with other political subdivisions as to requests for
economic development assistance. The information considered in executive
session must be directly related to economic development assistance which may
be provided by the City, or involving public infrastructure improvements or the
extension of utility services directly related to an economic development
project.
   If a municipal body holds an executive session pursuant to subsection (a)
hereof, the motion and vote to hold that executive session shall state which
one or more of the approved purposes listed in subsection (a) hereof are the
purposes for which the executive session is be held, but need not include the
name of any person to be considered at the executive session.
   If a municipal body holds an executive session to consider any of the
matters listed in subsections (b) to (g) hereof, the motion and vote to hold
that executive session shall state which one or more of the approved matters
listed in those subsections are to be considered at the executive session.
(Ord. 19-2014. Passed 6-2-14.)
 
   109.11  VALIDITY OF ACTION.
   An ordinance, resolution, rule or formal action of any kind is invalid
unless adopted in an open meeting of the municipal body. An ordinance,
resolution, rule or formal action adopted in an open meeting that results from
deliberations in a meeting not open to the public is invalid unless the
deliberations were for a purpose specifically authorized by Section
109.10 above and conducted at an executive session held in compliance with this
section.
(Ord. 35-88. Passed 5-23-88.)
 
   109.12 VIRTUAL PUBLIC MEETINGS.
   (a)   Members of a municipal body may hold and attend meetings and may
conduct and attend hearings virtually or a combination of in-person and
virtually.
   (b)   During any open meeting or hearing at which one or more members of the
municipal body attend virtually, all of the following shall apply:
      (1)    Any ordinance, resolution, motion, rule, decision, or formal
action of any kind shall have the same effect as if it had occurred during an
open meeting or hearing in which all of the members of the municipal body
attended in person.
      (2)    Members of a municipal body who attend meetings or hearings by
means of teleconference, video conference, or any other similar electronic
technology, shall be considered present as if in person at the meeting or
hearing, shall be permitted to vote, and shall be counted for purposes of
determining whether a quorum is present at the meeting or hearing.
      (3)    Municipal bodies shall provide notification of meetings and
hearings held under this section to the public, to the media that have
requested notification of a meeting, and to the parties required to be notified
of a hearing, at least twenty-four hours in advance of the meeting or hearing
by reasonable methods by which any person may determine the time, location, and
the manner by which the meeting or hearing will be conducted, except in the
event of an emergency requiring immediate official action. In the event of an
emergency, the municipal body shall immediately notify the news media that have
requested notification or the parties required to be notified of a hearing of
the time, place, and purpose of the meeting or hearing.
      (4)    The municipal body shall provide the public access to a meeting
held under this section, and to any hearing held under this section that the
public would otherwise be entitled to attend, commensurate with the method in
which the meeting or hearing is being conducted, including, but not limited to,
examples such as live-streaming by means of the internet, local radio,
television, cable, or public access channels, call in information for a
teleconference, or by means of any other similar electronic technology. The
municipal body shall ensure that the public can observe and hear the
discussions and deliberations of all the members of the municipal body, whether
the member is participating in person or virtually.
      (5)    When members of a municipal body conduct a hearing by means of
teleconference, video conference, or any other similar electronic technology,
the municipal body must establish a means, through the use of electronic
equipment that is widely available to the general public, to converse with
witnesses, and to receive documentary testimony and physical evidence.

   Whenever it is deemed necessary or desirable by any department head to make
any purchase of supplies, material, equipment or contractual services in order
to promote the more efficient operation of the public service of the agency
under his direction, he shall prepare and submit to the Director of Finance a
requisition therefor. Such requisition shall specify the nature of the purchase
desired, the quantity required and the performance requirements to be met. It
shall also indicate the date on which delivery is needed and may propose the
names and addresses of potential suppliers.
 
   111.03 PURCHASING THRESHOLD.
   (a)    Whenever the probable cost of supplies, materials and equipment or
the construction of public improvements for the municipality is equal to or
greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), one of the purchasing methods
described in Section
111.04 may be initiated.
   (b)    Purchases for supplies, materials and equipment or the construction
of public improvements below the threshold established in Section
111.03(a) may be made in accordance with rules and regulations determined by
the City Manager. (Ord. 02-2017. Passed 1-17-17.)
 
   111.04 FORMAL PURCHASING METHODS.
   When the purchasing threshold meets or exceeds the amount established in
Section
111.03, the City Manager may authorize one of the following formal purchasing
methods in accordance with the procedures described herein:
   (a)   Competitive bidding. Specifications shall be prepared for the
supplies, materials, equipment or the construction of a public improvement and
the City shall advertise for the solicitation of bids at least two weeks prior
to bid opening in one of the following ways:
      (1)   By publication in a newspaper of general circulation once a week
for two consecutive weeks; or
      (2)   By posting notification on the City's website and, to the extent

      (3)   By means of an abbreviated publication prescribed in Ohio Revised
Code Section 7.16; or
      (4)    In the manner exercised by an internet-based bidding information
service should the City determine to use such service for the purchase.
   When formal competitive bidding is employed, the bids shall be opened and
tabulated publicly by the Finance Director, or designee, at the time and place
specified in the advertisement for bids. The City Manager shall then award the
contract to the lowest and best responsible bidder, unless it is determined
that the public interest would be better served by rejecting all bids and
either ordering a new advertisement or abandoning the purchase. The City
Manager shall be responsible for establishing such other rules and regulations
which may be necessary to carry out the purpose of this subsection and which
would serve the best interest of the City, including without limitation rules
and regulations governing the receipt of bids that exceed the Engineer's
estimate and action to be taken by the City when no bids are received.
   As an alternative to in-person bid submissions and openings, the City may
select an internet based bidding information service as the vehicle for
submitting and processing sealed bids managed by the City.
   (b)   Design-build. The purchase of supplies, materials and equipment or the
construction of public improvements may be obtained through the design-build
process in accordance with the procedures established in the Ohio Revised Code,
or pursuant to such other procedures as may be established from time to time by
the City Manager. The purchase of computer software that is custom-built, in
whole or in part, to certain City specifications shall be considered to be an
equipment purchase that may be made by means of the design-build process.
   (c)   Construction Manager or Construction Manager At-Risk. The purchase of
supplies, materials and equipment or the construction of public improvements
may be obtained through the construction manager or the construction manager
at-risk process in accordance with the procedures established in the Ohio
Revised Code, or pursuant to such other procedures as may be established from
time to time by the City Manager.
   (d)   Reverse Auction. The City may utilize a reverse auction purchasing
process in which offerors submit proposals in competing to sell supplies,
materials and equipment or services in an open environment via the internet.
The procedures established in Ohio Revised Code Section 9.314 or such
procedures established by the City Manager shall be used.
   (e)   Other State of Ohio Authorized Methods. In addition to any of the
methods described in subsections (a) through (d) of this section, the City may
obtain supplies, materials and equipment and the construction of public
improvements by any other method authorized by the State of Ohio for public
entities.
      (Ord. 02-2017. Passed 1-17-17.)

purchasing process under the following circumstances:

   In case of actual emergency, and with the consent of the City Manager, any
using agency may purchase directly in the open market any supplies, materials,
equipment or contractual services whose immediate procurement is essential to
prevent delays in the work of the using agency which may vitally affect the
life, health or convenience of citizens. The head of such using agency shall
send to the Director of Finance a requisition and a copy of the delivery record

governmental agency without competitive bidding. In addition, the Director of
Finance, upon the concurrence of the appropriate Department Director or
Division Chief, shall have the authority to discard surplus property if it has
little or no value or use. Surplus property may be traded-in if in the sole
discretion of the Director of Finance such trade-in would be advantageous to
the City.
   (b)    The Director of Finance shall authorize and require competitive
bidding for the sale of a single item of surplus property which has an
estimated value of $1,000.00 or more. The sale of a single item of surplus

City Council by motion. Single items of surplus property which have an
estimated value of less than $5,000.00 but more than $1,000.00 shall be sold

   139.01  DUTIES OF DIRECTOR.
   The Department of Personnel shall be under the direction of the Director of
Personnel who shall be accountable to the City Manager and shall perform the
duties prescribed by City Charter Section
11.03.
 
   139.02  PERSONNEL POLICY.
   The basic personnel policy of the City shall be that:
   (a)   Employment in the City government shall be based on merit and fitness,
free from personal, racial, religious and political considerations.
   (b)   Recruitment shall be conducted on a broad basis in order to assure an
adequate field of selection.
   (c)   Just and equitable incentives and conditions of employment shall be
established and maintained in order to promote efficiency and economy in the
operation of the City government.
   (d)   Positions having similar duties and responsibilities shall be
classified and compensated on a uniform basis.
   (e)   Appointments, promotions and other personnel actions shall be based on
systematic tests and evaluations.
   (f)   Tenure of employees shall be subject to good behavior, the
satisfactory performance of work, necessity for the performance of work and the
availability of funds.
 
   139.03  PERMANENT STATUS.
   All persons holding positions not included among those exempted by Charter
Section
11.02 shall have a permanent status if:
   (a)   They were employed in such positions on November 18, 1957, the date on
which the City Charter became effective;
   (b)   They had served satisfactorily in the positions they now hold for a
period of six months before the effective date of this section (Ordinance 48-
59, passed May 4, 1959); or
   (c)   They shall serve a probationary period of six months or such longer
period as may be prescribed under the provisions of this chapter.
 
   139.04 CLASSIFICATION PLAN.
   The nonexempt positions in the service of the City shall be called the
classified service. The Personnel Director shall make an analysis of the duties
and responsibilities of all positions in the classified service and recommend
to Council, through the City Manager, a position classification plan. Each
position in the classified service shall be classified on the basis of the kind
and level of its duties and responsibilities. A class may include one position
or more than one position, and each class shall have a descriptive title which
shall be used for all personnel purposes including budget and payrolls. After
approval by Council of the initial classification plan by resolution, the
Personnel Director shall allocate each existing position to its appropriate
class. The class to which each position is initially allocated shall be the
class in which the employee shall have status under the provisions of Section
139.03.
 
   139.05  COMPENSATION PLAN.
   The Personnel Director, under the direction of the City Manager and in
consultation with the Director of Finance, shall prepare a compensation plan
which shall include all classes of positions covered by the classification
plan. The rate or range for each class shall be such as to reflect fairly the
difference in duties and responsibilities and shall be related to compensation
for comparable positions in other places of public and private employment. The
plan shall be presented to Council through the City Manager and, when approved
by Council by resolution, shall be applied to all positions and classes of
positions then in existence, in the manner provided in such resolution.
 
   139.06 AMENDMENT OF CLASSIFICATION AND COMPENSATION PLANS.
   The initial classification plan shall be kept up to date by the addition of
new classes or the abolition, consolidation, division or amendment of existing
classes by recommendation of the Personnel Director and City Manager, and
approval by resolution of Council. The compensation plan may be similarly
amended either through adjustment of rates or by reassignment of classes of
positions to different pay ranges, on recommendation by the Personnel Director
and City Manager, and approval by resolution of Council.
 
   139.07 RECRUITMENT AND SELECTION.
   Original appointments to vacancies occurring shall be based on merit as
determined by competitive examinations. Requirements as to applicant
qualifications shall be provided by rule established by the Personnel Director.
The Personnel Director shall determine the time and place of examinations and
shall post an advertisement for applications on the City's website and in such
other media as the Director shall determine expedient. The Director shall
prescribe the form of the application and shall conduct such investigation as
the Director deems necessary as to the truth of the statements made therein and
as to the qualifications of the applicant. The Director shall have authority to
exclude from the examination any applicant whose application discloses that he
or she does not possess the minimum qualifications established in the
classification plan for the position sought. The Director may also require all
applicants to be fingerprinted. Examinations shall be in such form as will
fairly test the abilities and aptitudes of the candidates to perform the duties
of the position sought. The Director shall determine the nature of the
examination and the weight to be attributed to each part and shall grade or
shall cause the examinations to be graded.
(Ord. 01-2017. Passed 1-17-17.)
 
   139.08  VETERANS PREFERENCE.
   Preference in entrance examinations, but not in promotion, shall be granted
to qualified persons who have been members of the armed forces of the United
States in time of war or national emergency and who seek to enter the service
of the City within five years immediately following their honorable discharge
from military service. Such preference shall be in the form of points added to
the final grades of such person, provided that they first attain a passing
grade of seventy percent (70%). The preference shall be five points for a
nondisabled veteran and ten points for a veteran currently receiving
compensation from the United States Veterans' Administration for war service
incurred disabilities of more than ten percent (10%). Eligibility for a veteran
preference credit shall be established by presentation of original discharge
papers or a photostat copy thereof.
 
   139.09 ELIGIBLE LISTS.
   Candidates who qualify for employment shall be placed upon an original
appointment eligible list for the appropriate class of position, in the rank
order of the grades they obtain on the examinations. The rank order of
candidates who are allowed veterans' preference shall be based on their
augmented ratings. Permanent employees laid off for lack of funds or work shall
be placed upon a re-employment eligible list. A probationary employee who is
laid off while the original appointment eligible list from which he was
appointed is still effective shall be restored to his original place on that
list. Eligible lists shall be effective for one year and may be extended for
one additional year in the discretion of the Personnel Director.
 
   139.10  PROMOTIONS.
   Vacancies in positions above the entrance level shall be filled by promotion
whenever in the judgment of the City Manager and Personnel Director it is in
the best interests of the City to do so. Promotions shall be on a competitive
basis except where the Personnel Director finds that the number of persons
qualified for promotion is insufficient to justify competition. Promotional
examinations shall give appropriate consideration to the applicant's
qualifications, record of performance and seniority. Those found eligible for
promotion shall be placed upon a promotional eligible list for the class of
positions for which the examination was given, in the rank order of the
composite score attained.
 
   139.11  CERTIFICATION AND APPOINTMENT.
   Whenever a vacancy exists for an original appointment, the appointing
authority shall ask the Personnel Director to certify the name or names of
persons eligible for appointment. If there is any name on an appropriate re-
employment eligible list, it shall be certified and the person so certified
shall be appointed. If there is more than one name, appointment shall be made
first of the person whose name has been longest on the list. If there are no
names on an appropriate re- employment eligible list, certification shall be
made of the names of the six persons standing highest on the appropriate
original appointment eligible list. The appointing authority shall appoint one
of these, notifying the Personnel Director, so that the person appointed may be
placed upon the payroll and the persons not appointed may be restored to the
eligible list. When the vacancy is in a position above the entry level, and a
promotional eligible list exists, the Personnel Director shall certify the
three names standing highest on this list from which the appointing authority
shall appoint one, notifying the Personnel Director of his action. The
Personnel Director shall furnish one additional name for each person who
indicates in writing to the appointing officer his unwillingness to accept
appointment.
(Ord. 40-96. Passed 5-13-96.)
 
   139.12 TEMPORARY APPOINTMENTS.
   Whenever an emergency exists which requires that a vacancy be filled at once
in order to maintain public services, the appointing authority may appoint any
qualified person temporarily to perform the duties of the position. However, no
such appointment shall be for a period longer than ninety days in any calendar
year.
(Ord. 42-99. Passed 7-26-99.)
 
   139.13  PROVISIONAL APPOINTMENTS.
   Whenever there is no eligible list from which a certification can be made,
the Personnel Director shall so inform the appointing authority and if in the
judgment of such appointing authority it is not expedient to await the
establishment of such a list, he shall submit the application of any person or
persons deemed by him to be suitable for noncompetitive examination. If on
review of the application and check of the references, the applicant is found
to possess the minimum qualifications established in the classification plan
for the position to be filled, the Personnel Director may authorize his
appointment as a provisional employee. A provisional appointment shall not be
for longer than three months during which an examination shall be given and an
eligible list established. The provisional appointee shall not be eligible for
regular appointment unless he has taken the examination and stands high enough
on the list to be reached for certification.
 
   139.14 PROBATION.
   Employees appointed from original appointment eligible lists and from
promotional eligible lists shall be subject to a period of probation. The
regular period of probation shall be six months, provided that the personnel
rules may specify a longer or shorter period of probation for certain
designated classes of positions, or for extension of the probation period in
individual cases. However, probation may not extend beyond twelve months. The
work and conduct of probationary employees shall be subject to close scrutiny
and evaluation and if found to be below standards satisfactory to the
appointing authority, the appointing authority may remove or demote the
probationer at any time during the probationary period. Such removals or
demotion shall not be subject to review or appeal. An employee shall be
retained beyond the end of the probationary period and granted permanent status
only if the appointing authority notifies the Personnel Director in writing
that his work has been found satisfactory and that he recommends that he be
given permanent status.
 
   139.15 RULES FOR WORK HOURS, ABSENCES, VACATIONS AND LEAVES.
   Rules shall be adopted prescribing hours of work, and the conditions and
length of time for which leaves of absence with pay and leaves of absence
without pay may be granted. These shall cover, among other matters: vacations,
sick leaves, and leaves for military service.
 
   139.16 DISCIPLINE.
   The primary responsibility for the administration of discipline shall rest
upon the immediate supervisor of the employee to be disciplined, although if he
fails to take action, which in the opinion of his superior is justified, such
superior may himself impose the discipline. Disciplinary action taken against
an employee, which is other than in the nature of a minor first offense warning
shall be in writing and made a part of such employee's permanent personnel
file. The employee shall be given notice of any disciplinary action taken
against him together with the reasons therefor not later than the effective
date of such action. The notice shall inform the employee of his rights to have
his case reviewed in accordance with the provisions of Section
139.17, supra.
(Ord. 53-70. Passed 6-22-70.)
 
   139.17 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE.
   Whenever an officer or permanent employee of the City feels aggrieved by the
action of his supervisor in the administration of discipline, he may present a
written statement of his grievance to the immediate supervisor of the
supervisor who administered the discipline within five working days of the
effective date of the disciplinary action taken against him, asking for a
review and reversal or modification of the disciplinary action. If such
grievance is not resolved to the satisfaction of the aggrieved employee by the
superior so addressed within a period of five working days, he may request in
writing, a review of his grievance by his department head, and if still
unresolved within five working days, he may request a review by the Personnel
Director. If the grievance is not resolved to the satisfaction of the aggrieved
employee by the Personnel Director within a period of ten working days, he may
request in writing a review of his case by the City Manager, provided the City
Manager has not already ruled on such case as a supervisor or the immediate
superior of the supervisor who administered the discipline.
   In all cases, the written ruling of the City Manager shall be final and
binding unless the disciplinary action taken against the employee and approved
by the City Manager involves suspension from duty without pay or demotion or
discharge, in which case the employee affected shall have the right to request
a hearing before the Personnel Appeals Board for purposes of reviewing the
final decision of the City Manager. Any such request for a hearing before the
Personnel Appeals Board must be submitted to the City Manager in writing within
five working days of the date of the City Manager's final decision and shall
specify in detail the reasons why the City Manager's decision is in error.
(Ord. 6-77. Passed 2-14-77.)
 
   139.18 PERSONNEL APPEALS BOARD.
   The City Manager shall report to Council each proper request for a hearing
before the Personnel Appeals Board filed under the provisions of Section
139.17. The Board shall have final authority to take action thereon. The City
Manager shall carry out the decision of the Board.
(Ord. 43-82. Passed 5-24-82.)
 
   139.19 RULES TO IMPLEMENT PERSONNEL MATTERS.
   The Personnel Director shall prepare, in consultation with the City Manager,
such rules as may be deemed desirable to carry out the provisions of the
Charter and of this chapter relative to personnel matters. Such rules shall be
reported to Council and unless amended or disapproved by resolution of Council
within thirty days after such report, shall become effective. Amendments and
supplements to the rules shall be made in the same manner.
 
   139.20 TRAINING.
   The Personnel Director shall encourage the improvement of service by
providing employees with opportunities for training not only for their present
position, but also for advancement and for general improvement and education.
 
   139.21 SEPARATION; REINSTATEMENT AFTER DISMISSAL.
   The tenure of every employee is conditioned upon good behavior and the
satisfactory performance of duties. Any employee may be permanently separated
by resignation or dismissal. The resignation of any employee other than the
City Manager shall become effective on acceptance by the City Manager, or if an
effective date is stated in the resignation, then on such date. Dismissals
shall become effective on the date specified in the order of removal. If an
employee is reinstated after dismissal, hearing by a Personnel Board of
Appeals, and approval of the report of the Board by Council, he shall be paid
his regular compensation for the period following his removal until his
restoration to duty.
 
   139.22 LAYOFFS.
   Whenever there is lack of work or lack of funds requiring a reduction in the
number of employees of the City, the required reduction shall be made in such
position classes as the appointing authority shall designate. Employees shall
be laid off in the inverse order of their relative length and quality of
service. Within each affected class, all temporary employees shall be laid off
before provisional employees, all provisional employees before probationary
employees, and all probationary employees before permanent employees.
 
   139.23 REINSTATEMENT AFTER VOLUNTARY RESIGNATION.
   An employee who resigns voluntarily may be reinstated to any position in the
same class and salary or in a class with equal or lesser salary requiring the
same or lesser skills, abilities and qualifications in the same department or
division if there is a need for the individual’s services within two years
after the date of resignation.
(Ord. 41-98. Passed 9-28-98.)
 
   139.24 RECORDS.
   The Personnel Director shall maintain adequate records of his own official
acts, the actions of all Personnel Appeals Boards, the examination record of
every candidate and the employment record of every employee.
 
   139.25  CLASS TITLE OF POSITION.
   The class title under which each position in the regular classified service
is known shall be used to designate such position in all budget estimates,
payrolls and other official records, documents, vouchers and communications,
and in all personnel processes.
 
   139.26 INITIAL RATES OF PAY.
   All appointments to positions in the classified service of the City shall
normally be made at the salary fixed in the lowest step of the appropriate
range. The City Manager may, however, authorize an appointment at a higher step
whenever the Personnel Director certifies to him that the City is unable to
recruit satisfactory employees at the lowest step, or when, on certification,
the Personnel Director recommends a higher step due to the training and
experience of the eligible candidate, provided funds are lawfully available.
 
   139.27  ADVANCEMENT.
   All increases in salary for persons in the classified service of the City
shall be made only upon recommendation of the division or department head to
the City Manager and then only if funds are lawfully available. Merit shall be
the primary basis for advancement in salary although seniority shall also be
considered. Such advancement shall normally be for only one step in the same
range.
 
   139.28 SALARY ON PROMOTION.
   Whenever a classified employee is promoted from a position in one class to a

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
         Chap.
161.    Mayor's Court.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 161
Mayor's Court
 
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and Criminal
Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged with an
offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is such
that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before him
and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
      In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the

      (1)   “Distracted” means doing either of the following while operating a
vehicle:
         A.   Using an electronic wireless communications device, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, in violation of that section.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
331.43.
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a
utility.
   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the

and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the

(ORC 4511.12)
 
   313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
 
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
 
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
 
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
 
   313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have

   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the

has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic

a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the blood,
breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has administered a field sobriety
test to the operator or person in physical control of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field

admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,

of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains

technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other

available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
               The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the
offender under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and
requires the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers'
intervention program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
                The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the
three-day jail term under this subsection if it places the offender under a
community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three
days, requires the offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a
drivers' intervention program so certified, and sentences the offender to a
jail term equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days that the
offender does not spend attending the program. The court may require the
offender, as a condition of community control and in addition to the required
attendance at a drivers' intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily
complete any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum
standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental
Health and Addiction Services that the operators of the drivers' intervention
program determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to
the court on the offender's progress in the programs. The court also may impose
on the offender any other conditions of community control that it considers
necessary.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers' intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers' intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers' intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers' intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
               The court may require the offender, under a community control
sanction imposed under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete
any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum standards
adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and
Addiction Services, in addition to the required attendance at drivers'
intervention program, that the operators of the drivers' intervention program
determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to the
court on the offender's progress in the programs. The court also may impose any
other conditions of community control on the offender that it considers
necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
               In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with
electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of
monitoring and jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed
by a community addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C.
5119.21, subject to subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the
offender to follow the treatment recommendations of the services provider. The
purpose of the assessment is to determine the degree of the offender's alcohol

to the court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses
related to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
               In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with
electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of
monitoring and jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed
by a community addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C.
5119.21, subject to subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of

that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
         As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days
required by subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this

this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court’s indigent drivers’ alcohol
treatment fund.
   (l)   Appeal Does Not Stay Operation of License Suspension. If a person
whose driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident

any aspect of the person’s trial or sentence, the appeal itself does not stay
the operation of the suspension.
   (m)   Subsection (a)(1)J. of this section does not apply to a person who

motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial

the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for

license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded

subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (f)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order
from the court, neither the Ohio Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy
registrar shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of
registration of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the
declaration of forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five
years after the date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).

that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.

commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by

   501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
 
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
 
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.

division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or

         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
 
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
 
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
 
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
 
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
 
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred

have occurred.
(ORC 2901.13)

   501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
 
   501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
 
   501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
 
   501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
 
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
 501.09.
 
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
"The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
 
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
 
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
 
   501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
 
   501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
 
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
 
   501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
 
   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
 
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
 
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5,000.00
Second degree                                 4,000.00

Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1,000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available

is expected to respond, excluding alarms installed in motor vehicles or
security devices carried on the person.

occurred at the location of the response. False alarms include activation of an
alarm caused by user error, mechanical failure, malfunction, or improper
installation. Excluded are alarms caused by tornadoes, hurricanes,

determine whether the activated alarm was an emergency as indicated by the
alarm system or whether the activated alarm was a false alarm.
   (b)   If the police officer or firefighter at the scene of the activated
alarm system determines the alarm to be false, the police officer or
firefighter shall make a report of the false alarm. A notification of the false

         (Ord. 42-2004. Passed 12-5-05.)
 
   503.06 LIABILITY OF CITY.
   The installation of interconnected alarm systems in conjunction with this
chapter shall not constitute acceptance by the City of any liability to

   539.05    COMPLAINT AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Complaints.
      (1)   Any person may file a charge with the City Clerk alleging that
another person has engaged or is engaging in an unlawful discriminatory
practice as defined in Chapter
539 of the Worthington City Codes. The charge shall be in writing and under
oath and shall be filed with the City Clerk within one hundred eighty (180)
days after the alleged unlawful discriminatory practice is committed. The City
Clerk shall forward a copy of the charge to the respondent and to the Law
Director.
      (2)   If the charge of discrimination alleges a violation based on race,
sex, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, age, disability, genetic
information, military status, and/or any other class or characteristic
protected under state or federal law, then the City Clerk shall instruct the
complainant to file a charge of discrimination with the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission (OCRC)/Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The City
Clerk shall provide the complainant with information about this requirement and
contact information for the OCRC/EEOC within ten (10) days from the date the
charge was filed with the City Clerk. The initial filing of a charge of
discrimination with the City Clerk will not extend the deadlines for filing a
charge of discrimination with the OCRC/EEOC.
   In the event of a deferral, any complainant who timely filed a charge of
discrimination under this Chapter may request the Law Director to review the
final determination made by the OCRC/EEOC on charges of discrimination
containing the same allegations as in the original charge filed under this
Chapter. Such request for review must be made within thirty (30) days of the
OCRC/EEOC's final disposition of the charge. The Law Director shall only have
authority to review dismissals of complaints based on insufficient time or
resources to fully investigate or a lack of jurisdiction. The Law Director
shall not have authority to review dismissals based on lack of probable cause.
   If the Law Director determines that the OCRC/EEOC dismissed the complaint
based on insufficient time or resources to fully investigate or a lack of
jurisdiction, the Law Director shall process the charge pursuant to Sections
 539.05(a)(3)-(7).
   Charges of discrimination alleging a violation of this Chapter based on
sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status or familial
status along with an allegation of discrimination based on race, sex, color,
religion, ancestry, national origin, age, disability, genetic information,
military status, and/or any other class or characteristic protected under state
or federal law shall be subject to deferral to the OCRC as set forth in this
section. If the OCRC/EEOC dismisses a charge of discrimination timely filed
under this Chapter and based on sexual orientation, gender identity or
expression, marital status, or familial status for lack of jurisdiction, the
complainant may, within thirty (30) days of such dismissal request the charge
to proceed under this Chapter. Upon request, the Law Director shall handle the
case in accordance with Sections
539.05(a)(3)-(7).
   The Law Director shall have no authority to review any charge under this
section if complainant or respondent has appealed the OCRC /EEOC decision to
court or otherwise challenged the alleged unlawful discriminatory practices in
state or federal court.
       (3)   For cases processed by the City without intervention of the OCRC/
EEOC, the Law Director shall notify the complainant and respondent of the
option for voluntary mediation. If both parties agree to voluntary mediation, a
mediator designated by the Law Director shall endeavor to eliminate such
alleged unlawful discriminatory practices by methods of mediation. The
mediation shall be conducted in accordance with Chapter 2710 of the Ohio
Revised Code. All mediation communications shall be privileged pursuant to
Section 2710.03 of the Ohio Revised Code. Nothing said or done during mediation
shall be made public unless the parties agree thereto in writing.
      (4)   Preliminary Investigation: If the Law Director determines that
methods of mediation have failed to effect the elimination of such alleged
unlawful discriminatory practice or that the state or federal government has
not exercised jurisdiction and/or provided mechanism for redress, the Law
Director shall conduct a preliminary investigation. If the Law Director
determines after such investigation, that it is not probable that unlawful
discriminatory practices have been or are being engaged in, the Law Director
shall notify the complainant and respondent in writing that it has been so
determined, and that no other action will be initiated under this chapter.
      (5)   Determination Hearing: If the Law Director determines that methods
of mediation have failed to effect the elimination of such alleged unlawful
discriminatory practice and that the state or federal government has not
exercised jurisdiction and/or provided mechanism for redress, and if the Law
Director determines after preliminary investigation that it is probable that
unlawful discriminatory practices have been or are being engaged in, then the
Law Director shall serve upon the respondent and complainant a notice of a
determination hearing before the Hearing Officer. The notice shall inform the
respondent and complainant of a hearing at a time and place therein fixed to be
held not less than thirty (30) days after the service of such notice and
stating the charges specified in the original charge upon which a probable
cause determination has been made against the respondent. If circumstances
warrant, the Law Director may serve such notice at any time during the
complaint procedure. The Hearing Officer will consider any reasonable requests
for extension of the hearing date and reserves the right to continue the
hearing, for good cause shown, for a period of up to thirty (30) additional
days.
   Any such charge may be amended by the Law Director or complainant at any
time prior to or during the hearing based thereon. The respondent shall have
the right to file an answer or to amend an answer to the original or amended
charge, and to appear to such hearing in person, or by attorney, present
evidence or otherwise to examine and cross-examine witnesses.
   The complainant shall be a party to the proceeding, and any person who is an
indispensable party to a complete determination or settlement of the question
involved in the proceeding shall be joined. Any person who has or claims an
interest in the subject of the hearing and in obtaining or presenting relief
against the acts or practices complained of, may be, in the discretion of the
Hearing Officer, permitted to appear for the presentation of oral or written
argument.
   In any proceeding, the Hearing Officer shall not be bound by the rules of
evidence prevailing in the courts of law or equity, but shall in ascertaining
the practices followed by the respondent, take into account all reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence, statistical, or otherwise, produced at the
hearing, which may tend to prove the existence of an unlawful discriminatory
practice or a predetermined pattern of unlawful discriminatory practices under
Section
539 of the City of Worthington Codes provided that nothing contained in this
section shall be construed to authorize or require any person to observe the
proportion which persons of any race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity
or expression, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, age, disability,
familial status or military status bear to the total population or in
accordance with any criterion other than the individual qualifications of the
applicant.
   The testimony taken at the hearing shall be under oath and before a court
reporter hired by the City Manager. The transcript of the hearing shall be
filed with the City Clerk.
   The Hearing Officer is granted the authority to develop and implement rules
and procedures to control the governance of the hearing. In conducting any
hearing as provided herein, the Hearing Officer may upon request of any party
subpoena as witnesses any person believed to have knowledge of the facts
relevant to such hearing, compel the production of books, papers, records or
other evidence relative to such hearing by the person having custody or control
thereof and may administer oaths, take testimony and issue such rules as shall
be necessary to effectuate an investigatory hearing under this section.
   The Hearing Officer shall issue a written decision concerning the charges in
the complaint. The decision shall include findings of fact and conclusions of
law. Any final decision by the Hearing Officer may be appealed to the Franklin
County Court of Common Pleas to the extent authorized by applicable law.
      (6)   Notice of Violation and Order to Cease and Desist: If upon all the
evidence presented, the Hearing Officer determines that the respondent has
engaged in, or is engaging in, any unlawful discriminatory practice under this
chapter, whether against the complainant or others, the Hearing Officer shall
issue a notice of violation, and shall issue an order to respondent to cease
and desist the unlawful discriminatory practice.
   In addition to issuing a cease and desist order, the Hearing Officer shall
have the authority to issue the following remedies:
         A.   If division (a)(7)B. or C. of this section does not apply, a
civil penalty in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000);
         B.   If division (a)(7)C. of this section does not apply and if the
respondent has committed one violation of this Chapter during the five-year
period immediately preceding the date on which a complaint was filed pursuant
to division (a)(1) of this section, a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed
two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500).
         C.   If the respondent has committed two or more violations of this
Chapter during the five-year period immediately preceding the date on which a
complaint was filed pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section, a civil
penalty in an amount not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000).
   The notice of violation, order to cease and desist and any other penalty
issued by the Hearing Officer shall be served on the respondent and
complainant.
   The Law Director is authorized to institute in the name of the City of
Worthington any appropriate civil enforcement proceedings.

the landlord must be subtracted from the total of the monthly rent prior to the
landlord calculating if the threshold level of income has been met. The

   541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
 541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
 
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall

545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or

545.05 or

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
 
   545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

   751.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   Purpose. That the purpose of this chapter is to establish reasonable
and uniform regulations to minimize and control the negative secondary effects
of sexually oriented businesses within the City in order to promote the health,
safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City. The provisions of this chapter
have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction
on the content of any communicative materials or communication, including
sexually oriented entertainment. Similarly, it is not the purpose or effect of
this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented
entertainment protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Furthermore, it is not the intent or effect of this chapter to
condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of entertainment that is
obscene.
 
   (b)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of sexually oriented businesses on the community presented in hearings before
City Council; on findings incorporated in the cases of the City of Renton v.
Playtime Theaters; Inc, Young v. American Mini Theaters; and on studies in
other cities including New York, New York; Islip, New York; Los Angeles,
California; Indianapolis, Indiana; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; and
Phoenix, Arizona; along with Manatee County, Florida; New Hanover County, North
Carolina; and the State of Minnesota; this Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities.
      (2)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-
private booths or rooms for viewing films, videos, or live sexually-oriented
entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases
such as syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
      (3)   Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that
encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions.
      (4)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate
those activities and maintain their facilities.
      (5)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented
films.
      (6)   The findings noted in paragraphs number 1 through 5 raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (7)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (8)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of
sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a
heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented
businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare
of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the City. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the sexually oriented business, and fully in possession and control
of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (9)   The regulation of nudity in sexually oriented businesses will
further the substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution and
other sex-related crimes, including illegal sex acts, and protecting the public
health, safety, and welfare.
      (10)   Removal of doors on viewing booths in sexually oriented businesses
and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths will advance
the substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary
sexual activity occurring in adult arcades and theaters and will facilitate
enforcement of the provisions of this Chapter and other federal, state and
local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (11)   Requiring sufficient lighting in all sexually oriented businesses
will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing illegal sexual
activity on the premises of sexually oriented businesses, and will facilitate
enforcement of the provisions of this Chapter and other federal, state and
local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (12)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of sexually oriented
businesses, and by employees of such businesses, will facilitate the
enforcement of the provisions of this Chapter and other federal, state and
local laws, and will thereby further the substantial government interest in
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (13)   A person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related
crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually
oriented business or adult motel.
      (14)   Barring such individuals from the management of and employment in
sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and
prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts, including conduct
which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.

business license or sexually oriented business employee license upon request of
the applicant. The provisional license:
      (1)   Will allow an applicant for a sexually oriented business license to
operate the sexually oriented business named in the license application under
the same terms as a normal sexually oriented business license issued pursuant
to Section
751.07 of this Chapter for the period of time specified in Subparagraph (g) of
this section; and
      (2)   Will allow an applicant for a sexually oriented business employee
license to act as an employee on the premises of a sexually oriented business
under the same terms as a normal sexually oriented business employee license
issued pursuant to Section
 751.09 of this Chapter for the period of time specified in Subparagraph (g) of
this section; and

   (h)   In the event that judicial review of the denial of a new license
application is still pending thirty (30) days before the expiration date of a
provisional license, the provisional licensee may file a renewal license
application with the Safety Director pursuant to Section
751.12 (b) of this Chapter. The Safety Director shall grant an application for
renewal of a provisional license unless the Safety Director determines that new
grounds exist for denial of a license application pursuant to Section
751.07 or Section
751.09 of this Chapter, which did not exist at the time of the original license
application. In the event that an application for renewal of a provisional
license is denied and the applicant seeks judicial review of that denial, the

of the previous license denial.

   901.01  DEDICATION AND ACCEPTANCE BY ORDINANCE.
   Any street or alley dedicated to public use by the proprietor of ground in
this City shall become a public street or alley, under the care and control of
the City only after the dedication is accepted and confirmed by an ordinance
specially passed for this purpose.
 
   901.02 TITLE TO DEDICATED PROPERTY; CONVEYANCE.
   The City shall acquire a fee simple title in any realty dedicated by the
proprietor for public use as a street, alley or park unless the proprietor
expressly limits the estate to a lesser estate in making the dedication and
such limitation is expressly accepted by the City in the ordinance accepting
the dedication. The recording of the approved plat in the office of the County
Recorder shall constitute a conveyance of the title.
 
   901.03 EASEMENTS.
   Whenever Council decides that it is in the public interest to acquire an
easement rather than a fee simple title to realty needed for a street or alley,
such lesser estate may be acquired on such terms as the vendor is willing to
grant. However, such easement shall be perpetual subject to reverter to the
grantor if the street or alley later is legally vacated. Such easements shall
not be accepted in approving subdivision plats.
 
   901.04 ACQUISITION OF TITLE BY PRESCRIPTION.
   Whenever realty has been used by the public for street or alley purposes
without interference or objection by the owner for an uninterrupted period
equal to or greater than that established by statute for the bringing of
actions to recover the title to or possession of real estate, the City shall
acquire by such use a prescriptive right to the continuation of such use in
perpetuity with the same estate as that of the original owner.
 
   901.05 LOSS OF TITLE BY PRESCRIPTION.
   Notwithstanding the general rule that the statute of limitations for
recovery of the use and possession of realty may not be invoked against the
City, whenever a street or alley, or any part thereof, laid out and shown on
the recorded plat of the City has not been opened to public use and has been
enclosed with a fence by the owners of the lots lying adjacent thereto, and has
remained in the open, uninterrupted use, adverse possession and occupancy of
such owners for the period of twenty-one years provided such street, alley or
lot is a part of the tract laid out by the original proprietors, the public
rights in such street or alley shall be extinguished.
 
   901.06 OPENING OR IMPROVING STREETS.
   Streets, alleys or public highways within the City may be opened,
straightened, altered, diverted, narrowed or widened only by authority of an
ordinance. Such ordinance shall briefly and in general terms describe the part
of the street, alley or public highway to be abandoned by reason of such
change, and the property to be appropriated for such purpose.
 
   901.07 PROCEDURE IN APPROPRIATION OF PROPERTY.
   The procedure to be followed in the appropriation of private real estate for
public use in the City, when it proves impossible to purchase such realty by
negotiation with the owner, shall be that established in Chapter
105 of the Administrative Code.
 
   901.08  VACATING STREETS AND ALLEYS.
   Whenever, in the opinion of Council, there is good cause for vacating a
street or alley, or any part thereof, and that such vacation will not be
detrimental to the general interest, it shall proceed by ordinance to order
such vacation.
 
   901.09 VACATING PROCEDURE.
   An ordinance vacating a street or alley will not be an emergency ordinance
in order that a public hearing may be held thereon in the manner provided by
Charter. Such an ordinance, if passed by Council after a public hearing, shall
be subject to referendum under the provisions of the Charter.
 
   901.10 MINIMUM CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS FOR RESIDENTIAL STREETS AND
NEIGHBORHOOD COLLECTORS.
   Minimum construction standards and requirements for improvement of
residential streets and neighborhood collectors in the City shall be
established by the standard drawings adopted by the City and in force at the
time of approval by the City Engineer.
(Ord. 94-87. Passed 11-23-87.)
 
   901.11 STREET IMPROVEMENTS TO COMPLY WITH MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   No person shall improve any street within the City in any manner which does
not comply with the minimum standards adopted in this chapter, nor shall
permission be granted to improve any street or alley except in accordance with
such minimum requirements and standards.
 
   901.12  VARIANCES BY COUNCIL.
   Council reserves authority to grant variances from the standards established
in this chapter by resolution when, in its judgment, such variances are
justified.
 
   901.13 ESTABLISHED STREET GRADE.
   The City Engineer shall establish a center line grade profile for each
street and alley in the City which shall be kept on file for public inspection
in the office of the Director of Service.
 
   901.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates Section
 901.11 is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

Service.
 
   903.02  EXCAVATION PERMIT REQUIRED; FEE.
   No person shall dig in or disturb the surface of any public street or alley
without first having secured a permit from the Building Inspector. The
application for such permit shall be approved by the Director of Service. The
fee for such permit shall be five dollars ($5.00) and the permittee shall cause
the excavation to be made at his own expense. No excavation shall be permitted
which will cause a permanent change in the established grade.
 
   903.03 DEPOSIT OR BOND FOR RESTORATION.
   At the time of securing a permit for street excavation, the applicant shall
deposit one hundred dollars ($100.00) or such larger amount as, in the opinion
of the Director of Service, is adequate for the purpose of replacing the
pavement. Contractors and public utilities engaged in an extensive program
requiring considerable excavation may make a single deposit, in an amount fixed
by the Director of Service, to cover their whole program. If the Director of
Service shall determine that the applicant is financially responsible and
competent to replace the pavement, the applicant may file a bond to cover
satisfactory performance and shall be permitted to refill the excavation and
replace the pavement, subject to inspection and approval by the Director of
Service. The bond shall be returned if performance is satisfactory.
 
   903.04  REFILLING AND RESURFACING.
   All refilling of excavations and all resurfacing of openings in the streets
shall be done by the proper officers and employees of the City, except as
provided in Section
903.03, and the cost of such refilling and resurfacing shall be charged to the
holder of the permit under which the openings were made. Such part of such
deposit as may remain after deducting the cost of refilling and resurfacing
shall be returned to the applicant upon the completion of resurfacing. If the
cost of such resurfacing is more than the amount deposited, such excess shall
be collected from the applicant.
 
   903.05 CORRUGATED, SPIKED OR RIBBED METAL WHEELS PROHIBITED.
   No person shall propel or cause to be propelled over any paved street any
vehicle or piece of machinery the wheels or carrying device of which are

smooth surface, and of a width commensurate with the weight carried. This
section shall not apply to vehicles with pneumatic tires.
 
   903.06  LITTERING.
   No person shall throw, drop, deposit or leave in or upon any part of any
street, alley, public park or place any waste paper, ashes, bottles, glass,
grass, leaves, rubbish or other refuse matter of any kind or description.

street or alley in the City across and over any public right of way, sidewalk
or curb upon any such street or alley, and to any private property bounding or
abutting on any such street or alley, or remove or disturb any part of such
right of way, sidewalk or curb on any such street or alley, for the purpose of
installing a driveway or entrance without first obtaining a permit to do so
from the Director of Service.
   Whenever any construction is to be undertaken on any lot to which access for
materials and equipment can be secured only from an improved street, the owner,
contractor or builder who is undertaking the construction shall, whenever there
is a curb and gutter, apply for a permit to cut such curb. Such application
shall be made to the Division of Building Inspection accompanied by a fee of
five dollars ($5.00) and a deposit of one hundred dollars ($100.00) to
guarantee the satisfactory completion of the work including the replacement of
the curb when such replacement is necessary. If the Director of Service, after
inspection, determines that the work has been properly done and that there has
been no unnecessary damage to the portion of the curb not so cut during the
construction, the deposit shall be returned after the construction project has
been completed.
   All permits herein provided for shall become null and void ninety days from
the date of issuance if not used, and any money paid therefor shall in no case
be refunded unless such unused permit is returned within such ninety days after
the date of issuance. No permit shall be issued except to the owner of the
premises or his authorized agent or contractor. The Director of Service may
refuse any permit in any case when, in the interests of public safety, such
permit ought not be granted. (Ord. 14-67. Passed 2-27-67.)
 
   903.09 DRIVEWAY REQUIRED AT CONSTRUCTION SITES.
   In order to minimize the carrying of mud and other debris onto the streets
and to lessen traffic hazards at construction sites, the contractor or builder,
before proceeding with the construction, enlargement, alteration, repair or
removal of any building or other structure, shall construct a driveway from the
edge of the pavement to the setback building line. Such driveway shall be at
least eight feet in width and shall be constructed with a minimum depth of four
inches of gravel or crushed stone, unless a driveway at least equal in
specifications is already available and in use.
 
   903.10 DRIVEWAY WIDTHS: COMPLIANCE AND EXCEPTIONS.
   No single driveway or entrance shall exceed thirty feet in width at the curb
line in residential districts. Driveways in all other districts may be forty-
five feet in width at the curb line. No more than one driveway or entrance
shall be permitted to any property abutting any street wherein the property has
a frontage of less than 200 feet; however, in hardship cases where the public
interest in involved, Council may, upon proper application and payment of the
required fee by the property owner or his authorized agent, by resolution,
authorize the Director of Service to issue a driveway or entrance permit in
excess of 30 feet for residential or 45 feet in the case of all other uses and
to issue more than one driveway or entrance permit where abutting property has
a frontage of less than 200 feet.
(Ord. 36-95. Passed 6-12-95.)
 
   903.11 PERMIT FOR STREET USE.
      Upon proper application, the Director of Safety, or their designee, may
authorize the use of a public street for the purpose of neighborhood gatherings
provided they are satisfied that the temporary blocking of the street to
vehicular traffic would not be detrimental to the community safety and will not
bring or create a hardship or prevent emergency vehicles from gaining access to
scenes of emergency. The applicant for a use of street permit shall be
responsible for the safekeeping of any equipment provided by the City.
(Ord. 46-2021. Passed 10-4-21.)

      (1)    Operator shall remove Small Cell Facilities and/or Wireless
Support Structures when such facilities are Abandoned regardless of whether or
not it receives notice from the City. Unless the City sends notice that removal
must be completed immediately to ensure public health, safety, and welfare, the
removal must be completed within the earlier of 60 days of the Small Cell
Facility and/or Wireless Support Structure being Abandoned, or within 60 days
of receipt of written notice from the City. When Operator abandons permanent
structures in the Right of Way, the Operator shall notify the City in writing
of such abandonment and shall file with the City the location and description

such removal. Operator must obtain a right of way work permit for the removal.
The City may require the Operator to complete additional remedial measures
necessary for public safety and the integrity of the Right of Way.
      (2)    The City may, at its option, allow a Wireless Support Structure to
remain in the Right of Way and coordinate with the owner to transfer ownership
of such Wireless Support Structure to the City, instead of requiring the owner
and/or Operator to remove such Wireless Support Structure.
   (e)   Restoration. Operator shall repair any damage to the Right of Way, any
facilities located within the Right of Way, and/or the property of any third
party resulting from Operator's removal or relocation activities (or any other
of Operator's activities hereunder) within ten (10) calendar days following the
date of such removal or relocation, at Operator's sole cost and expense.
Restoration of the Right of Way and such property must be to substantially the
same condition as it was immediately before the date Operator was granted a
Small Cell Permit for the applicable location, or did the work at such location
(even if Operator did not first obtain a Small Cell Permit). This includes
restoration or replacement of any damaged trees, shrubs, or other vegetation.
Such repair, restoration and replacement shall be subject to the sole,
reasonable approval of the City. (Ord. 38-2018. Passed 7-16-18.)

pursue the remedies of revocation of the Small Cell Permit or specific
performance of the violated provision.
   (c)   The City Manager may excuse violations of this Chapter for reasons of
Force Majeure.
   (d)   For purposes of this section, "Force Majeure" means a strike, acts of

characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   (d)   "Areas of Special Flood Hazard" means the land in the floodplain
subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Areas
of Special Flood Hazard are designated by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency as Zone A, AE, AH, AO, Al-30, and A99.
   (e)   "Base Flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The Base Flood may also be referred to

partial or complete inundation of normally dry land area from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)    The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
   (j)   "Flood Insurance Rate Map" (FIRM) means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.
   (k)   "Flood Insurance Study" means the official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban

   (n)   "Lowest Floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such
enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design requirements
specified in this chapter for enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (o)   “New Construction” means structures for which the "Start of
Construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of
Worthington's Flood Insurance Rate Map, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (p)   "Recreational Vehicle" shall have the meaning set forth in Section
1173.04 of this Code.
   (q)   "Start of Construction" means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within six months
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,

condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood related damage
sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period for
which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average,
equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   (t)   "Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction or
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety Code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit
and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions;
      (2)    "Historic Structure" provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structure's continued designation as a "Historic Structure"; or
      (3)    Any improvement to a structure which is considered new
construction.
   (u)   "Variance" means a grant of relief from the standards of this chapter
consistent with the variance conditions herein.

   1105.13 DESIGNATION OF FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   The City Manager is hereby appointed to administer and implement this
chapter by granting or denying development permit applications in accordance
with the provisions contained in this chapter.
   
   (b)   The duties and responsibilities of the City Manager in the
administration and implementation of this chapter shall include, but not be
limited to:
      (1)    Review of all development permit applications to determine that
the permit requirements have been satisfied, including receipt of all necessary
permits from applicable federal, state or local governmental agencies requiring
prior approval.
      (2)    Review of all development permit allocations to determine if the
proposed development is within a designated floodway, as delineated in the
flood insurance study.
      (3)    Direct the City Engineer to inspect all development projects
before, during and after construction to ensure compliance with this chapter.
         (Ord. 20-99. Passed 4-12-99.)
 
   1105.14 VARIANCE PROCEDURE. 
   (a)   Appeal Board. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide
appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
 
   (b)   Standards for Review. In passing upon such applications, the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations, all
relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)    The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
      (5)    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (6)    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (7)    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
      (8)    The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and
Floodplain Management Program for that area;
      (9)    The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
      (10)    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and,
      (11)    The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
 
   (c)   Conditions for Variances. 
      (1)    Variances may only be issued where due to physical characteristics
of the property compliance with the requirements of this chapter creates an
exceptional hardship. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the
requirements of this chapter does not constitute an exceptional hardship.
      (2)    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the Base Flood discharge would result.
      (3)    Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (4)    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the Base Flood level, providing items (1-11) in Section
1105.14(b) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-
half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
      (5)    Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (6)    Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in Section
1105.14(b), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (7)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the Base Flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
      (8)   Upon consideration of the factors of Section
1105.14(b) and the purposes of this chapter, the Board of Zoning Appeals may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.

   1129.05  POWERS AND DUTIES.
   (a)    Generally. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the following
powers, and it shall be its duty to: hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged there is an error of interpretation made by the Building Inspector in
the enforcement of this Zoning Ordinance, the Building Code, or the Property
Maintenance Code, or any amendment thereto.
   (b)    Exceptions. In hearing and deciding appeals, the Board shall have the
power to grant an exception in the following instances:
      (1)    Interpretation of Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Maps. Where the
street layout actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on
the Zoning District Map, the Board may interpret provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance.
      (2)    Reconstruction on nonconforming structure or use. Where a
nonconforming structure or a structure occupied by a nonconforming use has been
damaged to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of the current
replacement cost, the Board may permit reconstruction where it finds an owner
would incur undue hardship requiring a continuance of the nonconforming
structure or use.
      (3)    Performance Requirements. Where a decision is needed as to whether
an industry should be permitted within the "I-1" or "I-2" Industrial District
because of the methods by which it would be operated and because of its effect
upon uses within surrounding zoning districts. (Pertains to performance
requirements only.)
         A.    The Board shall have the power to authorize issuance of a
Certificate of Compliance for uses that are subject to performance requirements
as set forth in this Zoning Ordinance in Section
1175.03 provided they are accompanied by: a plan of proposed construction of
development; a description of the proposed machinery, processes and products;
and specifications for the mechanisms and techniques to be used in meeting the
performance requirements.
         B.    The Board may require the applicant to furnish the expert
opinion of consultants qualified to advise as to whether a proposed use will
conform to the performance requirements. A copy of such reports shall be
furnished to the Board.
      (4)    Changes in nonconforming uses. The Board may authorize
substituting a nonconforming use for another nonconforming use provided no
structural alterations except those required by law or ordinance are made.
However, in an "R", "AR" or WBC-1 District, no change shall be authorized by
the Board to any use which is not a permitted or conditional use in any "R",
"AR” or WBC-1 District, and in a "C" District or “WBC” District no changes
shall be authorized to any use which is not a permitted or conditional use in
any "C" District or “WBC” District.
      (5)    Temporary use permits. A temporary use permit may be granted where
the temporary use of a structure or premises in any district where such
temporary use shall be for a period of more than ninety days is proposed for a
purpose or use that does not conform to the regulations prescribed elsewhere in
this Zoning Ordinance for the district in which it is located, provided that
such use be of a temporary nature and does not involve the erection of a
substantial structure. A temporary use permit for such use shall be granted in
the form of a temporary and revocable permit, for not more than a six-month
period, subject to a six months' renewal and such conditions as will safeguard
the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare.
      (6)    Extension and construction completion periods. The Board may
authorize, for good cause shown, extension of the time period provided for the
completion of structures in the Building Code. However, the Board may not
authorize extension of the period for greater than a one-year extension of time
subject to one-year renewals and such conditions as well safeguard the public
health, safety, convenience and general welfare.
   (c)    Area Variances. The Board shall have the power to hear and decide
appeals and authorize variances from the provisions or requirements of this
Zoning Ordinance. In authorizing a variance, the Board may attach conditions
and require such guarantee or bond as it may deem necessary to assure
compliance with the objective of this Zoning Ordinance. The Board may grant a
variance in the application of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance when it
is determined that practical difficulty exists based on the following factors:
      (1)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
      (2)    Whether the variance is substantial;
      (3)    Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
      (4)    Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (e.g. water, sewer, garbage).
      (5)    Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge
of the zoning restriction;
      (6)    Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance; and,
      (7)    Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
   
   (d)    Interpretation of District Map. In case of any questions as to the
location of any boundary line between zoning districts, a request for
interpretation of the Zoning District Map may be made to the Board which shall
interpret the Map in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of this
Zoning Ordinance.
   
   (e)    Extension of Nonconforming Use. The Board shall have the authority to
grant an extension of a structure or the expansion of the use of a lot devoted
to a nonconforming use upon a lot occupied by such structure or use, or on a
lot adjoining, provided that such lot was under the same ownership as the lot
in question on the date such structure or use became nonconforming, and where
such extension is necessary and incidental to the existing use of such
structure or lot. However, the floor areas or lot areas of such extensions
shall not exceed, in all, 100 percent (100%) of the area of the existing
structure or lot devoted to a nonconforming use.
   (f)    Variances to the Building Code. The Board shall have the power to
hear and decide appeals and authorize such variances from the provisions or
requirements of the Building Code, Chapter
1305 of the Codified Ordinances for one, two and three family dwellings, and
Section
1301.07 Demolition or Moving Buildings, as will not be contrary to the public
interest. In authorizing a variance, the Board may attach conditions and
require such guarantee or bond as it may deem necessary to assure compliance
with the objective of the Building Code. The Board may grant a variance in the
application of the provisions of the Building Code for one, two and three
family dwellings after hearing expert independent testimony on the application
only if all of the following findings are made:
      (1)    There are unique circumstances or conditions present by which
strict conformity to the provisions of the Building Code would create
significant hardship for the property owner or contractor performing services
for the property owner;
      (2)    The unique circumstances or conditions were not created by the
property owner or contractor performing services for the property owner; and,
      (3)    The variance, if authorized, shall not, in any way endanger the
health, safety or welfare of the building occupants or the general public. Such
determination shall be based on independent expert testimony.
   (g)    Variances to the Property Maintenance Code. The Board shall have the
power to hear and decide appeals and authorize such variances from the
provisions or requirements of the Property Maintenance Code, Chapter
1311 of the Codified Ordinances. Variances may be granted only when the Board
determines that strict scrutiny to the provisions of the Property Maintenance
Code would create significant hardship for the property owner, and the
variance, if authorized, would not endanger the health, safety or welfare of
the general public. Variances to the Property Maintenance Code, if authorized,
are applicant specific and do not pass to future property owners or occupants.

   1143.01 MAP AND DATA INCORPORATED; MAP TO CONTROL.
   (a)   The Zoning Map of the City of Worthington as revised by the Municipal
Planning Commission, bearing date December 14, 1971, such Map being on file
with the City Clerk, together with all notations, references, data, district
boundaries and other information shown thereon, is hereby established as the
official Zoning Map of the City of Worthington and is hereby made a part of the
Zoning Ordinance of the City. The several districts and boundaries shown on the
official Zoning Map are hereby established and adopted. The official Zoning
Map, properly attested, shall be and remain on file in the office of the City
Clerk. The official Zoning Map shall control where there is apparent conflict
in district boundaries between those shown on such Map and the description as
found in the text of the Zoning Ordinance or any ordinance.

classification of any land within the City, the Clerk shall, within a period of
seven days after the effective date of the ordinance authorizing such change,
amend the Zoning District Map to reflect such change in zoning and such Map, as
amended from time to time, shall continue to constitute the official Zoning
District Map of the City. The Zoning District Map, properly attested, shall
remain on file in the office of the City Clerk. No changes of any nature shall
be made in the Zoning District Map or made thereon except in conformity with
the procedures set forth in this Zoning Ordinance. However, Council may, by
resolution, cause additional data to be made a part of such Map where such

   1145.01  CHANGES GENERALLY.
   For the purpose of the public necessity, convenience, general welfare or
good zoning practice, Council may by ordinance, after receipt of recommendation
thereon from the Municipal Planning Commission, and subject to the procedures
provided by the Charter and ordinances, amend, supplement or change the
regulations, district boundaries or classification of property. It shall be the
duty of the Commission to submit recommendations regarding all applications or
proposals for amendments, supplements or changes to Council.
(Ord. 22-87. Passed 5-11-87.)
 
   1145.02 PROCEDURE FOR CHANGE IN ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Applications. Applications for any change of district boundaries or
classifications of property as shown on the Zoning District Map shall be
submitted to the Director of Planning and Building at its public office, upon
such forms and shall be accompanied by such data and information as may be
prescribed for that purpose by the Municipal Planning Commission, so as to
assure the fullest practicable presentation of facts for the permanent record.
Each proposal for a zoning change shall be accompanied by a legal description
and reproducible vicinity map to a scale of one inch equals 200 feet, or other
scale as may be approved by the Director of Planning and Building, showing the
property lines, streets, proposed zoning, land uses within 300 feet of the area
proposed to be reclassified and location of structures and natural features on
adjacent properties. Each such application shall be verified by at least one of
the owners or lessees of property within the area proposed to be reclassified,
attesting to the truth and correctness of all facts and information presented
with the applications. Proposals to amend, supplement or change the
regulations, district boundaries or classification of property initiated by the
Commission shall be accompanied by its motion pertaining to such proposed
action.
(Ord. 09-2013. Passed 4-15-13.)
 
   (b)   Names and Addresses of Adjacent Property Owners. Any person or persons
desiring a change in the zoning classification of property shall file with the
application for such change, a statement giving the names and addresses of the
owners of all properties lying within 200 feet of any part of the property of
which the zoning classification is proposed to be changed.
 
   (c)   Introduction of Ordinance. Upon receipt of the application and
supporting data required by subsections (a) and (b) hereof, the zoning change
requested shall be set forth in ordinance form and shall thereafter be
introduced in writing at a regular meeting of Council. The proposed ordinance,
together with all supporting papers, shall be referred to the Commission for
investigation and report.
 
   (d)   Action of Commission. The Commission may recommend that the
application be granted as requested, or it may recommend a modification of the
zoning amendment requested in the application, or it may recommend that the
application not be granted. These recommendations shall then be certified to
Council within ten days after the Commission has taken its action.
   Prior to making its recommendation, the Commission may request environmental
impact studies, and may request and receive reports and studies from various
local and state agencies and departments having jurisdiction over the property
indicating whether any issues relating to or involving hazardous substances or
environmental laws exist which would negatively impact the property under
consideration.
(Ord. 83-94. Passed 4-10-95.)
 
   (e)   Public Hearing by Council.  The report of the Commission shall be made
within thirty days after the first regular Commission meeting following
introduction of the ordinance by Council, and shall include a recommendation
either:
      (1)    That the proposed amendment be adopted as submitted, or
      (2)    That the proposed amendment be revised in a specified manner and
adopted, or
      (3)   That the proposed amendment be rejected.
   If the Commission makes no report within thirty days, Council may proceed
without such report. Upon receipt of the report of the Commission, Council
shall fix a date for a public hearing on the amendment. Such hearing may be
held on but not before the fourteenth day following the fixing of the date or
on any day thereafter. Notice of the public hearing shall be published in the
same manner as notices are published for public hearings on Council ordinances.
If the amendment involves the zoning or rezoning of property, the notice of the
public hearing shall be posted on the property to be zoned, or rezoned, at
least ten days prior to the date of the City Council public hearing. During the
period between the fixing of the date of the hearing and the date of the
hearing, the text of the proposed amendment, together with any maps or diagrams
referred to therein, shall be kept on file in the office of the Planning and
Building Department for public examination during regular office hours. The
availability of such materials shall be indicated in the published notice of
the hearing.
(Ord. 01-2017. Passed 1-17-17.)
 
   (f)   Notice to Property Owners. If the rezoning application involves ten or
less parcels of land, the Clerk of Council shall give notice of the time, place
and purpose of the public hearing by mailing a first class mail notice not less
than ten days prior to the date of the public hearing to owners of property
within and contiguous to and directly across the street from such parcel or
parcels. The failure to notify as provided in this section shall not invalidate
any recommendation adopted hereunder.
 
   (g)   Action of Council. After receiving from the Commission certification
of the recommendations on the proposed amendment and after holding the above
public hearing, the Council shall consider such recommendations and vote on the
passage of the proposed amendment to the text of the Zoning Ordinance or the
Zoning Map. The Council may, by a majority of all its members, adopt or reject
the proposed amendment, with or without change.
(Ord. 59-80. Passed 9-8-80.)
 
   1145.03  ZONING OF NEWLY ANNEXED AREAS.
   Land annexed to the City shall be zoned in accordance with City zoning
standards within sixty days of the date of annexation. The Municipal Planning
Commission shall submit its recommendations to Council for zoning the newly
annexed area within twenty-one days of the date of annexation.
(Ord. 51-71. Passed 12-13-71.)
 
   1145.04  APPLICATION FEES.
   (a)   At the time that an application for a change of zoning districts is
filed with the Commission, as provided herein, there shall be deposited with
the Director of Finance, the sum of two hundred dollars ($200.00) as a fee to
cover investigation, legal notices and other expenses incidental to the
determination of such matter, such fee to be for one lot or part of one lot. An
additional fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) shall be deposited for each
additional lot or part of an additional lot which may be included in the
request, such additional lot or part of a lot to be adjacent to each other. The
total fee shall not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950.00). Such sums so
deposited shall be credited by the Director of Finance to the General Fund.
 
   (b)   In the event that the Commission disapproves the application and the
petitioner elects not to have the same certified to the Council, then a refund
of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) plus an additional refund of three dollars
($3.00) for each additional lot or part of an additional lot which was included
in the application, should be made to the petitioner by the Director of
Finance, provided that the Director of Finance is notified of such decision by
the petitioner within ten days from the time of the action taken by the
Commission.
(Ord. 51-71. Passed 12-13-71; Ord. 113-74. Passed 11-25-74.)
 
   1145.05 RECONSIDERATION OF PRIOR FORMAL REZONING ACTION.
   No application for rezoning of any parcel of ground, once formally acted
upon by either the Council or the Municipal Planning Commission, may be again
considered for any rezoning change by Council or the Municipal Planning
Commission until 180 days has elapsed from the date of formal action. In the
event both Council and the Municipal Planning Commission have taken formal
action, such time limit will be counted from the earlier of the two actions.

   (a)   At corner lots, no accessory uses, accessory structures, structures,
material or equipment storage shall be located in any required front yard. Side
yards fronting on the adjacent street can be reduced to two-thirds of the
required front setback from the right of way of the adjacent street.
   (b)   No accessory buildings shall be located in any front or side yard
except under unusual circumstances where such building shall not conflict with
the intent and purposes of this Zoning Ordinance, or, where enforcement shall
result in extreme hardship. In either case the decision to permit such activity
shall be made by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Accessory buildings such as
garages and storage buildings exceeding 120 square feet in area may be located
in the rear yard provided such buildings are set back at least eight feet from
the side lot lines and ten feet from the rear lot line. Accessory buildings of
120 square feet or less in area must be set back at least five feet from the

   1151.01 CONTINUATION, EXPANSION, ELIMINATION AND RECONSTRUCTION.
   (a)    Intent. Within the districts established by this Zoning Ordinance
(Ordinance 51-71, passed December 13, 1971) or amendments that may later be
adopted, there exist:
      (1)    Lots;
      (2)    Structures;
      (3)    Uses of land and structures;
      (4)    Characteristics of use; and
      (5)    Signs
   which were lawful before this Zoning Ordinance was passed or amended, but
which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this
Ordinance or future amendment. It is the intent of this section to permit these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
survival. It is further the intent of this section that nonconformities shall
not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding
other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district except as
otherwise provided in this Chapter and Section
1129.05(e) of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)    Incompatibility; Signs. Nonconforming uses are declared to be
incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use
of a structure, a nonconforming use of land or a nonconforming use of structure
and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this
section by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to
be seen from off the premises or by the addition of other uses, of a nature
which would be prohibited generally in the district involved.
   (c)    Prior Permits. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this section shall
be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of
any building for which a permit has been issued prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 62-2021. Passed 3-21-22.)
 
   1151.02 CERTIFICATES OF NONCONFORMANCE REQUIRED.
   A Certificate of Nonconformance shall be required for all lawful
nonconforming uses of land and structures created by adoption of this Zoning
Ordinance in accordance with the provisions of Section
1125.03.
(Ord. 62-2021. Passed 3-21-22.)
 
   1151.03  NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-
family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single
lot of record at the effective date of adoption of this Zoning Ordinance
(Ordinance 51-71, passed December 13, 1971) or amendment thereto,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Ordinance. Such
lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other
lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot
fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally
applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements
other than these applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform
to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of
yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
   If three or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this Ordinance (Ordinance 51-71, passed December 13, 1971) and if
all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width
and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for
the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance, and no portion of such parcel shall be
used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area
requirements established by this Zoning Ordinance, nor shall any division of
any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below the
requirements stated in this Ordinance.
(Ord. 62-2021. Passed 3-21-22.)
 
   1151.04  NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND (OR LAND WITH MINOR STRUCTURES ONLY).
   Where at the time of passage of this Zoning Ordinance (Ordinance 51-71,
passed December 13, 1971) lawful use of land exists which would not be
permitted by the regulations imposed by this Ordinance, and where such use
involves no individual structures with a replacement cost exceeding one
thousand dollars ($1,000), the use may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, provided:
   (a)    No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance;
   (b)    No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance;
   (c)    If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than one year, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to
the regulations specified by this Ordinance for the district in which such land
is located; and
   (d)    No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
Ordinance shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
      (Ord. 62-2021. Passed 3-21-22.)
 
   1151.05 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption of this
Zoning Ordinance or amendment thereto, that could not be built under the terms
of this Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height,
yards, its location on the lot or other requirements concerning the structure,
such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject
to the following provisions:
   (a)    No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.
   (b)    Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty percent
(50%) of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
   (c)    Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
   (d)    Should the graphics portion of a nonconforming sign be destroyed by
any means to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost
at the time of destruction, the graphics portion shall not be reconstructed
except in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
      (Ord. 62-2021. Passed 3-21-22.)
 
   1151.06 NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES IN
COMBINATION.
   (a)    If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost
of one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, or of structures and premises in
combination, exists at the effective date of adoption of this Zoning Ordinance
(Ordinance 51-71, passed December 13, 1971), or amendment thereto, that would
not be allowed in the district under the terms of this Ordinance, the lawful
use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions:
      (1)    No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
Ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located;
      (2)    Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building;
      (3)    If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may as a special exception be changed to
another nonconforming use provided that the Board of Zoning Appeals either by
general rule or by making findings in the specific case, finds that the
proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than
the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the
provisions of this Ordinance;
      (4)    Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on
which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not
thereafter be resumed;
      (5)    When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises
in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six (6) consecutive months or
for eighteen (18) months during any three-year period, except when government
action impedes access to the premises, the structure, or structure and premises
in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located; and
      (6)    Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises
in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this
subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%)
of the replacement cost at time of destruction.
   (b)    A lawful nonconforming single-family residential structure being used
for residential uses or a lawful nonconforming residential use may be enlarged,
extended, reconstructed, or structurally altered without Board approval under
Section
1129.05(e) as follows:
      (1)    The enclosure of an existing covered porch or screened porch with
windows or glass panels provided that both the existing roof structure and the
footprint remain the same;
      (2)    The addition of attached garages, covered porches, decks, or
similar non-habitable additions that are external to dwelling units provided
that it complies with the applicable development standards applicable to the R-
10 District;
      (3)    The addition of an accessory building associated with a
nonconforming single-family residential structure or nonconforming residential
use provided it is constructed in accordance with Section
1149.08 of this Zoning Ordinance; and
      (4)    The replacement or reconstruction of a nonconforming single-family
residential structure that has been destroyed or damaged provided that:
         A.    The prior nonconforming condition(s) is not increased;
         B.    All building materials and architectural details shall conform
to the applicable requirements of this code;
         C.    The new structure shall not extend beyond the limits of the
original foundation;
         D.    The application to reconstruct the nonconforming structure shall
be filed with the Planning & Building Department within twelve (12) months of
the structure being damaged or destroyed; and
         E.    The reconstruction of the structure shall not be detrimental to
adjacent property and the surrounding neighborhood.
            (Ord. 62-2021. Passed 3-21-22.)
 
   1151.07 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve consecutive months
on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures,
wiring, heating, air conditioning or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding
thirty-five (35%) of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming
structure or nonconforming portion of the structure as the case may be,
provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not
be increased.
   If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs
and maintenance and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe,
or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be
restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the
district in which it is located.
   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of
such official.

   1170.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.  
   Signs can obstruct views, distract, or confuse motorists, displace
alternative uses for land, lead to visual clutter, harm community aesthetics,
and pose other problems that call for regulation. The City has significant and
compelling interests in reducing these harms; these regulations are designed to
be content-neutral and narrowly tailored to these interests, and to leave ample
alternative channels of communication available. The purpose of this chapter is
the following:
   (a)   To protect the general health, safety and welfare by:
      (1)   Protecting and encouraging a more attractive economic and business
climate;
      (2)   Providing an instrument for protecting the physical appearance of
the community; and
      (3)   Encouraging high quality, effective outdoor graphics for the
purposes of navigation, information, and identification.
   (b)   To encourage the proper development and use of signage and to permit
and regulate signs in such a way as to support and complement land-use
objectives set forth in the Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)   To provide businesses in the City with equitable sign standards in
accord with fair competition and aesthetic standards acceptable to the
community, to provide the public with a safe and effective means of locating
businesses, services and points of interest within the city, and to provide for
a safe vehicular and pedestrian traffic environment.
   (d)   In addition to protecting from distractions and obstructions that can
contribute to traffic and pedestrian accidents, it is the intent of these
regulations to control and regulate signs to prevent them from negatively
impacting adjacent properties and the community.
   (e)   It is the City’s intent to comply with all requirements of the U.S.
and Ohio constitutions and statutes requiring that sign regulations remain
content neutral.

case of a corner lot, either frontage may be used in determining maximum area
for signage.
      (3)   For ground signs, planters, or other decorative supporting
structures shall be excluded in the computation of sign area unless the
structure exceeds two (2) feet in height or eight (8) feet in width, in which
case the entire structure shall be included in the computation of sign area.
      (4)   The area for wall signs, including those that consist of
individually mounted letters, numbers, or other symbols, on a fascia or wall or
other permanent or temporary structure shall be the area of a rectangle
circumscribed around the letters, numbers, or other symbols.

         (Ord. 36-2023. Passed 6-17-24.)
   1170.10 NONCONFORMING AND ABANDONED SIGNS.
   (a)   Nonconforming Signs. Where a lawful sign exists at the effective date
of adoption of this Zoning Ordinance or amendment thereto, but does not meet
the conditions of this ordinance, such sign shall be deemed legally
nonconforming and may be continued subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   Should such nonconforming sign or portion thereof be destroyed or
altered by any means to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%), it shall
not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this
Ordinance.
      (2)   Should the graphics portion of a nonconforming sign be destroyed by
any means to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost
at the time of destruction, the graphics portion shall not be reconstructed
except in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
   (b)   Abandoned Signs. If any sign becomes abandoned in the manner defined
herein, such a sign shall be removed. An abandoned sign is defined as any sign
that meets any one of the following criteria:
      (1)   Any sign associated with an unlawful nonconforming use.
      (2)   Any conforming sign that remains after the termination of a
business if the business has ceased operations and is closed to the public for
at least 180 days or six (6) months within a twelve-month period. Seasonal
businesses are exempt from this determination.
      (3)    Any nonconforming sign that remains after the termination of a
business.Upon determining that a sign is abandoned, the Building Inspector
shall make a reasonable effort to notify, in writing, the owner of the property
on which the sign is located. Upon receiving notification that an abandoned
sign exists on the property, the owner shall have the abandoned sign removed
within thirty (30) days or shall file an appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals
under the procedure prescribed in Chapter
1129. The filing of such an appeal shall stay the time for removal of the sign
pending decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals. If the Board upholds the
decision of the Building Inspector, the abandoned sign shall be removed within
thirty (30) days of the Board’s decision. If thereafter the property owner does
not remove the sign, the City Manager shall instruct the Director of Law to
take appropriate steps to have the sign removed at the owner’s expense.

any duly permitted or allowed non-commercial message; provided, that the sign
abides by the provisions of this Chapter, without consideration of message
content.
   (b)   The purpose of this Section is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of
commercial speech over non-commercial speech or favoring of any particular non-
commercial message over any other non-commercial message.
   (c)   This provision does not create a right to increase the total amount of
signage on a parcel nor does it affect the requirement that a sign must comply
with all other regulations set forth in this Chapter.

than five vehicles shall be closer than twenty feet to any dwelling, school,
hospital or other institution for human care located on an adjoining lot,
unless screened by an unpierced masonry wall. In no case shall any part of a
parking area be closer than five feet to any established street or alley right
of way. The wall or hedge required in Section
 1149.03 (b) shall not extend into any front yard required by this Zoning
Ordinance. Off-street parking areas for more than five vehicles shall be
effectively screened on each side which adjoins or faces premises situated in
any "R" District, or institutional premises, by a masonry wall or solid fence.
   (b)   Joint Use. Two or more nonresidential uses may jointly provide and use
parking spaces when their hours of operation normally overlap, provided that a
written agreement, approved by the Director of Law and accepted by the Board
shall be filed with the application for a Certificate of Compliance.
   (c)   Other Locations. Parking spaces may be located on a lot other than
that containing the principal use provided it is within 300 feet. Lots farther
than 300 feet from the principal use may be accepted provided that a written
agreement, approved by the Director and accepted by the Board, shall be filed
with the application for a building permit.
   (d)   Surfacing. Any off-street parking area for more than five vehicles
shall be graded for proper drainage and surfaced with concrete, asphaltic

   (h)   Landscaping of Parking Areas. All parking lots shall provide, in
addition to screening requirements, two inches dbh (diameter, breast, height)
tree trunk size for every six parking spaces. All trees shall be balled and
burlapped. The minimum diameter at breast height of any tree shall be two
inches. Planting beds for parking lot trees shall be constructed so as to
distribute landscaping throughout the parking lot and minimize damage to trunks
and roots of the trees from vehicles, pedestrians and parking lot maintenance
through the use of adequate soil planting area and curbing or parking blocks.
Planting soil area per tree shall be a minimum of forty-five square feet. The
minimum dimension for the planting area shall be five feet on any one side. All
trees shall be maintained in a healthy condition. Any lot with a minimum
dimension of fifty feet on any one side shall have at least one tree planting

applicant continuing to hold the approval, the Commission shall make such
recommendation to Council. After receiving the recommendation from the
Commission, Council may initiate necessary proceedings to revoke the approval.
(Ord. 22-87. Passed 5-11-87.)
 
   (e)     Changes, Adjustments, or Rearrangements of the Final Development.
      (1)   After the final development plan has been approved by Council, a
request for the change, adjustment, or rearrangement of buildings, parking
areas, entrances, heights, or yards shall be submitted to the Director of
Planning and Building for a determination as to whether a review of such
change, adjustment, or rearrangement by the Planning Commission is required. If
the proposed amendment otherwise complies with this Planning and Zoning Code,
contains changes that do not conflict with the standards established by the
final development plan, and maintains the character and integrity of the
original development, then such amendment may be approved by the Director of
Planning and Building without further review. The City may establish standards
of review in making such determination, including without limitation, the
degree of:

submit an application to the Director of Planning and Building for a Planning
Commission Review of Amendment to Development Plan.
         (Ord. 09-2013. Passed 4-15-13.)
      (3)   The Planning Commission may disapprove such proposed amendment, but
may recommend a further review by Council for any reason, in which case a
report and recommendation shall be forwarded to Council. Council shall hold a
public hearing on the proposed amendment, and, if, thereafter, Council
determines such proposed amendment substantially conforms to the standards
established by the final development plan and complies with this Planning and
Zoning Code, such amendment may be authorized by Council, by resolution or
ordinance.
      (4)   The Planning Commission may:
         A.   Disapprove such proposed amendment with no further review by
Council or
         B.   Approve such proposed amendment with no further review by Council
if it determines that the amendment substantially conforms to the standards
established by the final development plan and it complies with this Planning
and Zoning Code.
Provided, however, that a decision of the Planning Commission to approve an
amendment to a development plan with no further review may be appealed to
Council by any Planning Commission member or Council member by the filing of a
written notice with the Clerk of Council within fifteen days of such decision,
in which case a report and recommendation shall be forwarded to Council.

uses and development standards for the property as detailed in drawings and
Development Standards Text.
   (b)   Final Plan. The Final Plan shall be submitted to the Municipal
Planning Commission to review for conformance to the adopted PUD. The Final

the removed tree, and this shall be documented as part of an approved Natural
Features preservation plan and/or landscape plan. In the event the Municipal
Planning Commission determines that full replacement would result in the
unreasonable crowding of trees upon the Lot, or that such replacement is not
feasible given site conditions, a fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00)
per caliper inch of trees lost and not replaced on such property shall be paid
in cash to the City for deposit in the Special Parks Fund. Such deposits shall
be used for reforestation on public property.

      (3)   Public Area Payments.
         A.   The City Council shall determine whether a portion of such PUD
should be dedicated on the plan to a public agency for park, playground or
recreational uses. Such dedication may be required only if the City Council
determines that there is a need for such property and that the dedication is
related both in nature and extent to the impact that the proposed development
will have on the parks and recreation system.
         B.   Whenever commercial or industrial space is created as part of a
PUD, then the developer or owner, as the case may be, shall make a cash payment
to the City in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per 1000 gross
square feet of new or expanded commercial or industrial space for deposit in
the Special Parks Fund. Such deposits shall be used for costs associated with
the City's parks, playground and recreation areas. This section shall not apply
to any PUD for which a dedication of land to the City was required pursuant to
subsection (A) hereof.
         C.   Whenever any new Dwelling Units are created as part of a PUD,
then the developer or owner, as the case may be, shall make a cash payment to
the City in the amount of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per each new
Dwelling Unit created for deposit in the Special Parks Fund. Such deposits
shall be used for costs associated with the City's parks, playground and
recreation areas. This section shall not apply to any PUD for which a
dedication of land to the City was required pursuant to subsection (A) hereof.
         D.   The public area payment required by this section shall be made
prior to the issuance of the building permit for the project.
      (4)   Public Space Amenities. A minimum of one Public Space Amenity as
approved by the Municipal Planning Commission shall be required for every five-
thousand (5000) square feet of gross floor area of multiple family dwelling,
commercial or industrial space that is new in the PUD. Public Space Amenities
are elements that directly affect the quality and character of the public
domain such as:
         A.   An accessible plaza or courtyard designed for public use with a
minimum area of two-hundred fifty (250) square feet;

   (e)   In the event the applicant receiving approval of the integrated
shopping center does not proceed with its construction within the time limit
established by the Commission, the City shall require the applicant to show
cause why such approval should not be revoked. If the Commission determines

request for the change, adjustment, or rearrangement of buildings, parking
areas, entrances, heights, or yards shall be submitted to the Director of
Planning and Building for a determination as to whether a review of such
change, adjustment, or rearrangement by the Planning Commission is required. If
the proposed amendment otherwise complies with this Planning and Zoning Code,
contains changes that do not conflict with the standards established by the
final development plan, and maintains the character and integrity of the
original development, then such amendment may be approved by the Director of
Planning and Building without further review. The City may establish standards
of review in making such determination, including without limitation, the
degree of:
         A.   Expansion or demolition of structures;
         B.   Change to parking spaces or traffic circulation in parking lots;

may recommend a further review by Council for any reason, in which case a
report and recommendation shall be forwarded to Council. Council shall hold a
public hearing on the proposed amendment, and, if, thereafter, Council
determines such proposed amendment substantially conforms to the standards
established by the final development plan and complies with this Planning and
Zoning Code, such amendment may be authorized by Council, by resolution or
ordinance.
      (4)   The Planning Commission may:
         A.   Disapprove such proposed amendment with no further review by
Council; or
         B.   Approve such proposed amendment with no further review by Council
if it determines that the amendment substantially conforms to the standards
established by the final development plan and it complies with this Planning
and Zoning Code.
Provided, however, that a decision of the Planning Commission to approve an
amendment to a development plan with no further review may be appealed to
Council by any Planning Commission member or Council member by the filing of a
written notice with the Clerk of Council within fifteen days of such decision,
in which case a report and recommendation shall be forwarded to Council.
      (5)   Nothing in this section is intended to limit or restrict the right
of appeal of a decision of the Planning Commission to Council as set forth in
this Planning and Zoning Code.
      (6)   All applications for a Planning Commission Review of Amendment to
Development Plan shall be submitted with a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00).

not be served by the applicant continuing to hold the approval, the Commission
shall make such recommendation to Council. After receiving the recommendation
from the Commission, Council may initiate necessary proceedings to revoke the
approval.
(Ord. 22-87. Passed 5-11-87.)

request for the change, adjustment, or rearrangement of buildings, parking
areas, entrances, heights, or yards shall be submitted to the Director of
Planning and Building for a determination as to whether a review of such
change, adjustment, or rearrangement by the Planning Commission is required. If
the proposed amendment otherwise complies with this Planning and Zoning Code,
contains changes that do not conflict with the standards established by the
final development plan, and maintains the character and integrity of the
original development, then such amendment may be approved by the Director of
Planning and Building without further review. The City may establish standards
of review in making such determination, including without limitation, the

report and recommendation shall be forwarded to Council. Council shall hold a
public hearing on the proposed amendment, and, if, thereafter, Council
determines such proposed amendment substantially conforms to the standards
established by the final development plan, and complies with this Planning and
Zoning Code, such amendment may be authorized by Council, by resolution or
ordinance.
      (4)   The Planning Commission may:
         A.   Disapprove such proposed amendment with no further review by
Council; or
         B.   Approved such proposed amendment with no further review by
Council if it determines that the amendment substantially conforms to the
standards established by the final development plan and it complies with this

amendment to a development plan with no further review may be appealed to
Council by any Planning Commission member or Council member by the filing of a
written notice with the Clerk of Council within fifteen days of such decision,
in which case a report and recommendation shall be forwarded to Council.
      (5)   Nothing in this section is intended to limit or restrict the right
of appeal of a decision of the Planning Commission to Council as set forth in

towers and antenna support structures as a primary option rather than
construction of additional single-use towers;
   (d)   To avoid potential damage to adjacent properties caused by
communications towers and wireless telecommunications facilities by ensuring
such structures are soundly and carefully designed, constructed, modified,
maintained and removed;
   (e)   To the greatest extent feasible, ensure that communications towers and
wireless telecommunications facilities are compatible with surrounding land
uses;
   (f)   To the greatest extent feasible, ensure that proposed communications
towers and wireless telecommunications facilities are designed in harmony with
natural settings and in a manner consistent with current development patterns;

premises. Trellises or other structures supporting or for the purpose of
supporting vines, flowers or other vegetation when erected in such a position
as to enclose, partially enclose or divide any premises or any part of any
premises shall also be considered a fence. Solid fences and walls are those
fences and walls which have less than forty percent (40%) free or open area.
Gates and gate openings shall not be counted as free or open areas when
determining whether or not a fence is solid. Hedges and shrubs shall not be
considered fences, but are regulated in Section
1180.07.
   (b)   Permit and Plan. No fence or wall shall be erected in any district
until a permit for such purpose has been issued by the Building Inspector.
Application for such permit shall be made in writing and shall be accompanied
by plans or drawings showing the actual shape and dimension of the lot on which
the fence or wall is to be constructed, the exact location, height, length,

necessary to accommodate differences in grade. No fence or wall in an "R"
district shall exceed a height of six feet.
(Ord. 52-2016. Passed 12-19-16.)
   (b)   Solid fences and walls shall be constructed of brick, stone, wood or
other compatible material as determined by the Building Inspector. No barbed
wire fences or a fence having cutting edges of any kind shall be constructed or
maintained within this district. Supporting members for walls or fences shall
be installed so as not to be visible from any other property which adjoins or
faces the fences or walls. This shall not apply to fences with vertical
supporting members where the fence is designed to be identical in appearance
from either side.
(Ord. 12-2010. Passed 4-19-10.)
   1180.03 "AR" AND COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS.
   In any "AR" or Commercial District, no fence or wall shall be erected in the
area between the street line and the building setback line. No fence or wall in
an "AR" or Commercial District shall exceed a height of six feet, except fences
or walls to screen equipment or dumpsters may extend high enough to completely
screen the equipment or dumpsters, but shall not exceed a height of ten feet.
Solid fences and walls shall be constructed of brick, stone or wood. No barbed

   It shall be the duty of each property owner to determine property lines and
to ascertain that the fence thus constructed does not deviate from the plans as
approved by the Building Inspector, and the fence does not encroach upon
another lot or parcel of land. The City shall furnish such inspection as is
deemed necessary to determine that the fence is constructed in accordance with
plans submitted for the permit as outlined in Section
1180.01(b). However, the issuance of the permit by the City shall not be
construed to mean the City has determined the fence is not encroaching upon
another lot, nor shall it relieve the property owner of the duty imposed upon
him herein. (Ord. 12-2010. Passed 4-19-10.)
   1180.07 SHRUBBERY AND HEDGES.
   No shrubbery or hedge shall be planted beyond the property lines. Except as

affect the vision of drivers on the public streets, to keep the same trimmed to
a maximum of four feet in order to avoid creating traffic hazards. Where this
is not done within ten days after notice by the Director of Service, it shall
be lawful for the employees of the City to enter upon such property and trim
the shrubbery or hedge at the expense of the property owner. Any shrub or hedge
found to be located upon public property may be removed by the City at any
time.
(Ord. 12-2010. Passed 4-19-10.)
   1180.08 GROWTH OF BAMBOO.
   (a)   Definitions. As used in this chapter, certain terms are defined as
follows:
      (1)   "Bamboo" means any tropical or semi-tropical grasses classified as
"running bamboo" with monopodial (leptomorph) rhizome (root) systems which
typically send off the rhizomes far away from the plant.
      (2)   "Bamboo Owner" means any property owner or resident who has planted
and/or grows Bamboo, or who maintains Bamboo on the property, or who permits
Bamboo to grow or remain on the property even if the Bamboo has spread from an
adjoining property. Any property owner or resident at whose property Bamboo is
found will be considered a Bamboo Owner, except any property owner or resident
who:
         A.   Did not plant or grow or cause Bamboo to be planted or grown on
his or her property; and
         B.   Has provided satisfactory proof to the City that, within a
reasonable period of time after discovering the encroachment of Bamboo onto the
property from an adjoining or neighboring property, advised the owner of such
property, by delivery of a written notice, of an objection to the encroachment
of the Bamboo and a request for the Bamboo to be removed; and
         C.   Has initiated steps for the removal of the Bamboo from the
property.
   (b)   Applicability. For purposes of this Section
1180.08, Bamboo found growing upon property shall constitute presumptive
evidence that the Bamboo was planted and/or grown by and with the consent of
the owner upon whose property the Bamboo is growing. If the Bamboo is found to
have encroached, spread, invaded or intruded upon any property other than the
property on which it was planted, including public property and right-of-way,
it shall be presumed that the Bamboo is "running bamboo" as defined herein, and
subject to the provisions of this Section
1180.08.
   (c)   Duty to Confine. All Bamboo Owners must confine Bamboo in a manner
that will prevent the Bamboo from encroaching, spreading, invading or intruding
onto any other private or public property or right-of-way, and shall be
required to take any such reasonable measure to do so, including but not
limited to the installation of a properly constructed and maintained
underground physical barrier system. A Bamboo Owner who fails to confine Bamboo
to the Bamboo Owner's property shall be subject to the penalty provisions of
Section
1180.08(g) herein.
   (d)   Property Owners Affected by Bamboo. In the event that a property owner
notifies a Bamboo Owner that Bamboo is encroaching, spreading, invading or
intruding upon such property owner's property, as required under Section
1180.08(a)(2)B., such notifying property owner shall give consent to the Bamboo
Owner for the Bamboo Owner to enter such notifying property owner's property in
order that the Bamboo Owner may remove the Bamboo thereon. Failure to give
consent shall hold the notifying property owner responsible for the removal of
the encroaching Bamboo at such property owner's cost. Consent hereunder shall
also be deemed to be consent given to a contractor that the Bamboo Owner may
hire for the removal of the Bamboo, and to the City or the City's contractor
should that become necessary. Neither the Bamboo Owner, the City, or a
contractor hired on behalf of the Bamboo Owner or the City to remove Bamboo
from a neighboring property, shall be liable for incidental damages caused by
the removal of the Bamboo.
   (e)   Failure to Confine. In the event Bamboo growing on a Bamboo Owner's
property encroaches or grows onto an adjoining or neighboring property, and the
Bamboo Owner fails to remove the Bamboo, or fails to cause it to be removed
following a request to do so by the affected adjoining property owner within
ten (10) days from the date of the request, the affected adjoining property
owner shall notify the Director of Service and Engineering of such
encroachment. The Director shall be provided satisfactory proof from the
affected adjoining neighbor that the Bamboo Owner was notified of the
encroachment and had the requisite number of days to remove the Bamboo. The
Director shall confirm the presence of the encroaching Bamboo and shall notify
the Bamboo Owner in writing of such encroachment, which notice shall:
      (1)   Specify the nature and location of the violation;
      (2)   Provide notice of the requirement to remove all portions of the
Bamboo plant from the affected adjoining property within ten (10) days from the
date of the notice; and
      (3)   State that the failure to comply with the notice and order may hold
the Bamboo Owner liable to the City for the cost of removal, any fines that may
be imposed pursuant to Section
1180.08(g), and the City's cost to install a barrier system as may be permitted
under Section
1180.08(i).
   The Director's notice shall be sent to the Bamboo Owner by certified mail,
return receipt requested.
   (f)   Appeal. If a Bamboo Owner believes that the determination of the
Director of Service and Engineering that he or she is in violation of the
provisions of this Section
1180.08 is in error, then that determination may be appealed to the City
Manager within five (5) days of receipt of the notice to remove the Bamboo
issued pursuant to subsection (e) hereof, by the filing of a written notice of
appeal. The Bamboo Owner shall have the opportunity to present relevant
evidence to the City Manager, or the City Manager's designee (which may be a
hearing officer appointed by the City Manager), with or without legal counsel.
A record of the hearing shall be kept, including without limitation all
documentary evidence presented together with a record of the testimony offered
by any witnesses, whose testimony shall be duly sworn. The decision of the City
Manager, or designee, shall be rendered at the hearing and mailed to the person
to whom the original notice was served by regular and certified mail, within
five (5) days of the date of the decision.
   At the hearing, the City Manager, or designee, may: (i) direct the Bamboo
Owner to remove the encroaching Bamboo within ten (10) days of the receipt of
the appeal decision; (ii) order the Bamboo to be removed, order the
installation of a physical barrier system (for subsequent violations), or order
both, either with City crews or by contracting with a third party, in which
case the Bamboo Owner will be charged with the cost of such work ordered to be
done, plus a 25% administrative fee as set forth in subsection (j) hereof; or
(iii) grant the appeal and reverse the Director's order.
   (g)   Penalty.  Any Bamboo Owner, whether a person, firm, corporation, or
other legal entity, that is found to have failed to remove Bamboo when noticed
to do so under Section
1180.08(e) shall be fined $100.00 per day for each day that the Bamboo remains
after the expiration of the 10-day notice period given by the Director of
Service and Engineering. This penalty shall be vacated only if the Bamboo Owner
is found not to be responsible for the Bamboo removal as a result of an appeal
determination. A penalty shall be stayed from the date the matter is appealed
to the date the appeal is decided. All penalty amounts not paid when due may
result in the City pursuing collection through the court, which amounts sought
shall include all unpaid fines plus the cost of collection.
   (h)   City Removal of Bamboo. If the Bamboo Owner fails to remove the Bamboo
as directed in the notice sent pursuant to subsection (f) or as a result of an
order to do so by the City Manager at the appeal hearing, the Director of
Service and Engineering shall cause the Bamboo to be removed and destroyed, and
may employ the necessary labor and equipment to perform such task, together
with any cleanup work required, within appropriations previously made by
Council. The City shall not be liable to an owner of property affected by
Bamboo for damages caused as a result of the Bamboo removal.
   (i)   Installation of a Physical Barrier System by City. Successive
violations of this Ordinance may result in the City determining, at the City's
discretion, to enter upon the land of the Bamboo Owner and install a physical
barrier system designed to contain the Bamboo and prevent its encroachment to
adjoining properties. The cost of the installation of the barrier system shall
be charged to the Bamboo Owner as provided in subsection (j) herein. The City
shall not be liable to a Bamboo Owner for damages caused as a result of the
barrier system installation.
   (j)   Statement of Cost to Owner. When the Director of Service and
Engineering causes Bamboo to be removed as provided in subsection (h) above, or
when the City installs a physical barrier system as provided in subsection (i)
above, a statement of the cost thereof shall be mailed to the Bamboo Owner by
certified mail, return receipt requested. If the certified mail is returned or
refused, then such statement may be sent by ordinary mail, or personal service
by posting at the subject property if the Bamboo Owner is the occupant thereof,
by any means that assures and documents delivery. Such statement of cost shall
include the following costs of the City:
      (1)   Labor and materials.
      (2)   Transportation of equipment.
      (3)   Equipment rental.
   The minimum fee to be charged shall be twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per
hour. A 25% administrative fee shall be charged on the total amount of the
costs of removal.
   (k)   Cost Payment; Unpaid Costs a Lien. The Bamboo Owner shall pay such
amounts as are charged in accordance with subsection (j) hereof to the City
Clerk within thirty days after receipt of the statement of costs. Any payment
so received shall be restored to the appropriation from which the cost was
paid. If the fee is not paid when due, the Director of Finance shall certify to
the County Auditor the proceedings taken under this section, together with a
statement of the charges for services as listed in subsection (j) hereof and a
legal description of the premises. Such amounts shall be entered upon the tax
duplicate and shall be a lien upon such lands from the date of entry, and shall
be collected as other taxes and returned to the City General Fund as provided
by Ohio Revised Code Section 731.54. These costs shall be separate from any
fine that may be imposed as a penalty under subsection (g) hereof.

buffer between the sidewalk and building, with some variations in the Building
Setback Line encouraged throughout the WBC.
         A.   Buildings 50,000 square feet in area or less shall be located
between 5' and 20' from adjacent Right-of-Way Lines. Buildings greater than
50,000 square feet in area shall be located at least 20' from adjacent Right-
of-Way lines.
         B.   Buildings located along High Street north of Wilson Bridge Road
shall be located at least 50' from the adjacent Right-of-Way lines.

be located closer than 25' to the property line.
         D.   Setback areas in front of retail uses shall be primarily
hardscaped, and may be used for outdoor dining and other commercial activities.
Residential units with individual entries may include landscaping, walkways,
porches, raised planters, walls and fences.
         E.   As building height increases, the buildings should consider the
relationship between the setback, the street corridor, and the building height.
A variety of techniques will be implemented to mitigate any potential "canyon/
tunneling" effect along the corridor, such as the use of floor terracing,
changes in building massing, insertion of a green commons, recessed seating and
dining areas, and lush landscaping.
      (2)   Right-of-Way Dedication. Dedication of Right-of-Way may be required
to accommodate public improvements.
      (3)   Screening. All development on parcels abutting properties in "R"
districts shall be permanently screened in the setback area with the
combination of a solid screen and landscape screening. The solid screen shall
consist of a wall or fence at least 6' in height and maintained in good
condition without any advertising thereon. Supporting members for walls or
fences shall be installed so as not to be visible from any other property which
adjoins or faces the fences or walls. This shall not apply to walls or fences
with vertical supporting members designed to be identical in appearance on both
sides.
Landscape screening shall consist of one of the following options at a minimum:
         A.   One large evergreen tree with an ultimate height of 40' or
greater for every 20 linear feet, plus one medium evergreen tree with an
ultimate height of 20' to 40' for every 10 linear feet. Evergreen trees shall
be at least 6' in height at the time of planting. Shrubs and ornamental grasses
shall be incorporated into the setback area as to complement the tree
plantings. A minimum of one shrub or ornamental grass, at least 24" in height,
shall be provided for every 5 linear feet. Shrubs and grasses may be planted in
clusters and do not need to be evenly spaced.
         B.   One large deciduous tree with an ultimate height of 50' or
greater for every 25 linear feet, plus one medium deciduous tree with an
ultimate height of 20' to 40' for every 15 linear feet. Shrubs and ornamental
grasses shall be incorporated into the setback area as to complement the tree
plantings. A minimum of one shrub or ornamental grass, at least 24" in height,
shall be provided for every 5 linear feet. Shrubs and grasses may be planted in
clusters and do not need to be evenly spaced.
      (4)   Equipment.  Exterior service, utility, trash, and mechanical
equipment shall be located to the rear of buildings if possible and screened
from view with a wall, fence or landscaping. Such equipment shall be completely
screened from view. Materials shall be consistent with those used in the
building and/or site. Equipment located on buildings shall match the color of
the building.
      (5)   Tract Coverage. A maximum of 75% of the property shall be covered
with impervious surfaces.
      (6)   Pedestrian Access. Sidewalks with a minimum width of 5', Recreation
Paths with a minimum width of 10', or a combination of both shall be provided
along all Rights-of-Way. Pedestrian connections from Sidewalks, Recreation
Paths and parking lots to building entrances shall be provided.
      (7)   Drive-in Commercial Uses. Drive-in Commercial Uses shall be
oriented so that the drive through is not between the primary street frontage
and the building.
   (b)   Buildings. Building design should enhance the character of the WBC. A
diversity of architectural styles is encouraged to provide visual interest and
add to the overall appeal of the corridor.
      (1)   Design.
         A.   A principal building shall be oriented parallel to Wilson Bridge
Road, or as parallel as the site permits, and should have an operational entry
facing the street.
         B.   The height of a building shall be a minimum of 18' for flat roof
buildings measured to the top of the parapet, or 12' for pitched roof buildings
measured to the eave. Maximum building height shall be per Section
1181.06 of the Code. Building Frontage that exceeds a width of 50' shall
incorporate articulation and offset of the wall plane to prevent a large span
of blank wall and add interest to the facade. To avoid a potential "canyon/

   (c)   (1)   On the net profits earned on and after July 1, 2010 of all
unincorporated businesses, professions or other activities conducted by
residents of the City.
      (2)   On the net profits earned on and after July 1, 2010 of all
unincorporated businesses, professions or other activities conducted in the
City by nonresidents.
      (3)   For the purposes of subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2) above, an
association shall be taxed as an entity, on the net profits of the association
derived from the work done or services performed or rendered and business or
other activities conducted in the City, whether or not such association has its
principal or any place of business located in the City, effective for all
accounting periods commencing on or after January 1, 1999.
      (4)   For the purposes of subsection (c)(1) above, a resident of the City
who is a member of an association is taxed individually on that resident's
entire share, whether distributed or not, of the annual net profits of the
association which are not subject to entity filing under subsection (c)(3)
above, effective for all accounting periods commencing on or after January 1,
1999.
   (d)   On the net profits on and after July 1, 2010 of all corporations,
estates, and trusts derived from work done or services performed or rendered
and business or other activities conducted in the City, whether or not such
corporations, estates, and trusts have their principal or any place of business
located in the City.
   (e)   On a resident's entire share, whether distributed or not, of the net
profits of a Subchapter S corporation as defined in Section 1361 of the
Internal Revenue Code. If a resident is a shareholder in two or more Subchapter
S corporations to be included in the same return, the resident's share of the
net loss of one Subchapter S corporation (except any portion of a loss
separately reportable for municipal tax purposes to another taxing entity) may
be used to offset the resident's share of the profits of another Subchapter S
corporation for purposes of arriving at overall net profits derived from
Subchapter S corporations. Credit on the tax imposed by this paragraph shall be
given for tax paid on the resident's share of the net profits of a Subchapter S
corporation under Sections
1703.01(d) and
1707.01 of this Taxation Code. The tax imposed under this paragraph is
effective for all accounting periods commencing on or after January 1, 2001.
      (Ord. 03-2010. Passed 6-7-10.)
 
   1703.02 ALLOCATIONS OF NET PROFITS.
   (a)   In the taxation of income which is subject to the tax, if the books
and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or profession both within and
without the boundaries of the City shall disclose with reasonable accuracy what
portion of its net profit is attributable to that part of the business or
profession conducted within the boundaries of the City, then only such portion
shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the City for purposes of the
tax. In the absence of such records, net profit from a business or profession
conducted both within and without the boundaries of the City shall be
considered as having a taxable situs in the City for purposes of the tax in the
same proportion as the average ratio of:
      (1)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the City during
the taxable period to the average net book value of all of the real and
tangible personal property owned by the taxpayer in the business or profession
during the same period, wherever situated. Real property shall include property
rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be
determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight (8);
      (2)   Qualified wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the
taxable period to persons employed in the business or professions for services
performed in the City to qualified wages, salaries and other compensation paid
during the same period to persons employed in the business or profession,
wherever their services are performed; and
      (3)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the City to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
   (b)   In the event a just and equitable result cannot be obtained under the
formula provided for herein, the Administrator, under application of the
taxpayer, shall have the authority to substitute other factors or methods
calculated to effect a fair and proper apportionment.
   (c)   As used in this Taxation Code, "sales made in the City" means:
      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the City, regardless of where title passes, if shipped or delivered from a
stock of goods within the City;
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the City, regardless of where title passes even though transported from a point
outside the City, if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through his own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion;
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the City to purchasers outside the City, regardless of where title
passes, if the sale is not generated through solicitation or promotion by an
employee of the taxpayer at the place where delivery is made.
         (Ord. 53-2004. Passed 12-6-04.)
 
   1703.03 LEVY OF TAX.
   (a)   The income tax at the rate of one percent (1.00%) shall be levied,
collected, and paid with respect to the salaries, wages, commissions, and other
compensation earned on or before December 31, 1993, and with respect to the net
profits of businesses, professions, or other activities earned on or before
December 31, 1993. The income tax at the rate of one and sixty-five hundredths
of one percent (1.65%) shall be levied, collected, and paid with respect to the
salaries, wages, commissions, and other compensation earned on or after January
1, 1994, and with respect to the net profits of businesses, professions, or
other activities earned on or after January 1, 1994. The income tax at the rate
of two percent (2.00%) shall be levied, collected, and paid with respect to the
salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation earned on or
after January 1, 2004, and with respect to the net profits of businesses,
professions, or other activities earned on or after January 1, 2004. The income
tax at the rate of 2.50% shall be levied, collected, and paid with respect to
the salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation earned on
or after July 1, 2010. Where the fiscal year of the business, profession, or
other activity differs from the calendar year, the tax at the rate of one
percent (1.00%) shall be applied to that part of the net profits for the
portion of the fiscal year occurring before January 1, 1994. The tax at the
rate of one and sixty-five hundredths of one percent (1.65%) shall be applied
to that portion of the fiscal year occurring on and after January 1, 1994. The
tax at the rate of two percent (2.00%) shall be applied to that portion of the
fiscal year occurring on and after January 1, 2004. The tax at the rate of
2.50% shall be applied to that portion of the fiscal year occurring on and
after July 1, 2010.
   (b)   Where the fiscal years of a business, profession or other activity is
other than a calendar year, in computing the tax, the profits of such taxpayer
shall be determined by dividing the annual profits by twelve (12) and
multiplying the quotient by the number of months of the fiscal year between
October 1, 1971, through December 31, 1993, multiplying the quotient by the
number of months of the fiscal year between January 1, 1994 and December 31,
2003, multiplying the quotient by the number of months of the fiscal year
between January 1, 2004 and June 30, 2010, and multiplying the quotient by the
number of months of the fiscal year between July 1, 2010 and thereafter, and
applying the appropriate tax rate to each.
(Ord. 03-2010. Passed 6-7-10.)
 
   1703.04 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Any person whose only income is exempt from the tax imposed by this
chapter must file an exemption certificate declaring the nature of the
exemption. Each taxpayer who engages in business, or whose salaries, qualified
wages, commissions and other compensation are subject to the tax imposed by
this chapter shall, whether or not a tax is due thereon, make and file a return
on or before April 15 of each year with the Department of Taxation on a form
furnished by or obtainable from the Department, setting forth the aggregate
amount of salaries, qualified wages, commissions and other compensation earned
and/or net profits earned and/or gross income from such business less allowable
expenses in the acquisition of such gross income earned during the preceding
year and subject to the tax, together with such other pertinent information as
the Administrator may require. Provided, however, that when the return is made
for a fiscal or other period different from the calendar year, the return shall
be made on or before the fifteenth (15) day of the fourth month after the close
of the fiscal year or other period.
   (b)   Commencing with taxable years beginning subsequent to December 31,
1982, the net loss from an unincorporated business activity may not be used to
offset salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation, and subsequent to
December 31, 2000 on the net profits from a resident’s share in a Subchapter S
corporation. However, if a taxpayer is engaged in two or more taxable
unincorporated business activities to be included in the same return, the net
loss of one unincorporated business activity (except any portion of a loss
separately reportable for municipal tax purposes to another taxing entity) may
be used to offset the profits of another for purposes of arriving at overall
net profits from unincorporated business activities. Commencing with taxable
years beginning subsequent to December 31, 2000, the net loss from a resident’s
share of a Subchapter S corporation may not be used to offset salaries,
qualified wages, commissions or other compensation or the net profits from an
unincorporated business activity. However, if a resident taxpayer is a
shareholder in two or more Subchapter S corporations included in the same
return, the net loss of one Subchapter S corporation (except any portion of a
loss separately reportable for municipal tax purposes to another taxing entity)
may be used to offset the profits of another for purposes of arriving at
overall net profits from a resident’s share in Subchapter S corporations. A
husband and wife in any taxable year, may elect to file separate or joint
returns.
   (c)   If a net operating loss has been sustained in any taxable year such
losses may not be carried forward or backward to any other taxable year.
Nothing in Chapter 718.01 of the Ohio Revised Code requires the City to allow a
net operating loss carry-forward.
   (d)   Affiliated corporations may not deduct a loss from any other
corporation having a taxable profit. Operations of any affiliated corporation
may not be taken into consideration in computing net profits or business
allocation percentage formula of another.
   (e)   The taxpayer making a return shall at the time of the filing thereof,
pay to the City the amount of taxes shown as due thereon; provided, however,
that where any portion of the tax so due shall have been deducted at the source
pursuant to the provisions of Section
1703.06 or where any portion of such tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant
to the provisions of Section
 1703.07 or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality, credit
for the amount so paid in accordance with Section
1707.01 shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance,
if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return.
   (f)   A taxpayer who has overpaid his income tax in any taxable year may
request a refund provided there is no other tax liability and provided,
further, that no amount less than one dollar ($1.00) will be refunded or
collected.
   (g)   The Administrator shall have the authority to extend the time for
filing of the annual return, provided the request of the taxpayer for extension
is made in writing and received on or before the original due date of the
return. If the extension is granted, the extended due date of the City’s income
tax return shall be the last day of the month following the month to which the
due date of the federal income tax return has been extended. The Administrator
may require a tentative return, accompanied by payment of the amount of tax
shown to be due thereon on or before the original due date. No penalty shall be
assessed, in those cases in which the return is filed and the final tax paid
within the period as extended.
   (h)   When the last day for filing a return falls upon a Saturday, Sunday or
federal holiday, the taxpayer shall be permitted to file on or before the first
business day following such Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday without
penalty.
   (i)   A husband and wife may file either separate returns or a joint return
for City purposes, even though one of the spouses has neither taxable income
nor deductions included on the City’s return regardless of whether their
federal and state returns were filed separately or jointly. If a joint city
return is made, the tax shall be computed on the aggregate taxable income and
the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and several.
   (j)   The return shall be filed with the Tax Administrator or their
authorized agent, on a form or forms furnished by or obtainable upon the
request from the Tax Administrator; or on a generic form, if the generic form,
when completed and filed, contains all of the information required to be
submitted with the City’s prescribed return and, if the taxpayer or return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the Tax Code governing
the filing of returns.
(Ord. 53-2004. Passed 12-6-04.)
 
   1703.05 AMENDED RETURN AND REFUNDS FOR OVERPAYMENT.
   Where an amended return must be filed in order to report additional income
and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax overpaid, subject to
the requirements and/or limitations contained in Section
1703.04(e) such amended return shall be on a form obtainable on request from
the Department of Taxation. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting
or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original
return.
   Within three (3) months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability, such taxpayer shall make
and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City tax based
upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and pay any additional
tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment. Except for
a claim resulting from and filed within three (3) months of the final
determination of a taxpayer’s Federal tax liability, no refund shall be allowed
unless a written request be presented to the Income Tax Administrator within
three (3) years after the date the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later. (Ord. 24-2002. Passed 6-17-02.)
 
   1703.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer within or doing business within the City shall deduct at
the time of payment of such salaries, qualifying wages, commissions or other
compensation as defined in Section
1701.18 of this Taxation Code, the tax of two and one-half percent (2.50%) of
the gross salaries, qualifying wages, commissions or other compensation due by
the said employer to the said employee and shall, on or before February 28th,
make a return showing the amount of taxes so deducted and a record of payments
showing that all taxes deducted during the year have been paid to the City in
accordance with the payment schedule prescribed by subsection (c) hereof. Such
employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and
withheld, whether or not such taxes have in fact been withheld. Every employer
or officer of a corporation is deemed to be a trustee for this Municipality in
collecting and holding the tax required under the ordinance to be withheld and
the funds so collected by such withholding are deemed to be trust funds.
   (b)   In the case of employees who are non-resident professional athletes,
the deduction and withholding of personal service compensation shall attach to
the entire amount of qualifying wages, salaries, and other compensation
received for games that occur in the taxing community. In the case of a non-
resident athlete not paid specifically for the game played in a taxing
community, the following apportionment formula must be used: The wages,
salaries and other compensation earned and subject to tax is the total income
earned during the taxable year, including incentive payments, signing bonuses,
reporting bonuses, incentive bonuses, roster bonuses and other extras,
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of exhibition,
regular season and post-season games the athlete played (or was available to
play for his team, as an example, with substitutes), or was excused from
playing because of injury or illness, in the taxing community during the
taxable year, and the denominator of which is the total number of exhibition,
regular season, and post-season games which the athlete was obligated to play
under contract or otherwise during the taxable year, including games in which
the athlete was excused from playing because of injury or illness. Exhibition
games are only those games played before a paying audience, and played against
another professional team from the same professional league. In the case of
non-resident salaried athletic team employees who are not professional
athletes, deduction and withholding shall attach to qualifying wages, salaries
and other compensation earned for personal services performed in the City.
   (c)   Employers shall pay to the City all income taxes withheld or required
to be deducted and withheld on either a semimonthly, monthly or quarterly basis
depending on the amount of taxes involved according to the following payment
schedule:
      (1)   Semimonthly payments of the taxes deducted are to be made by an
employer if:
         A.   The total taxes deducted in the prior calendar year were twelve
thousand dollars ($12,000) or more; or
         B.   The amount of taxes deducted for any month in the preceding
quarter exceeded one thousand dollars ($1,000). Such payment shall be paid to
the City within five banking days after the fifteenth and the last day of each
month.
      (2)   Monthly payments of taxes withheld shall be made by an employer if
the taxes withheld in the prior calendar year were less than twelve thousand
dollars ($12,000.00) but more than one thousand one hundred ninety-nine dollars
($1,199.00) or if the taxes withheld during any month of the preceding quarter
exceeded one hundred dollars ($100.00). Commencing with taxable years
subsequent to December 31, 1998 monthly payments of taxes withheld shall be
made by an employer if the taxes withheld in the prior calendar year were less
than twelve thousand dollars ($12,000.00) but more than three thousand five
hundred ninety nine dollars ($3,599.00), or if taxes withheld during any month
for the preceding quarter exceeded three hundred dollars ($300.00). Such
payments hall be paid to the City within fifteen days after the close of each
calendar month. However, those taxes accumulated for the third month of a
calendar quarter by employers making monthly payments pursuant to this
paragraph need not be paid until the last day of the month following such
quarter.
      (3)   All employers not required to make semimonthly or monthly payments
of taxes withheld under (1) and (2) of this subsection shall make quarterly
payments no later than the last day of the month following the end of each
quarter.
   (d)   Each employer who maintains a place of business in the City and
another branch within the metropolitan area of the City shall also withhold the
tax from the employees residing in the City but working at the employer's
metropolitan area branch, even though the payroll records and place of payment
are outside the City.
   (e)   The employer shall make and file Form 17 furnished by the Department
of Taxation, showing the amount of tax deducted by said employer from the
salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation of any employee and paid by
the employer to the City. The Form 17 shall also reconcile to prior remittances
and returns filed by the employer for such tax year with respect to taxes
withheld. Such employer's return shall be accepted as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this Taxation Code is the
salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation returned by the employer.
   (f)   Each employer on or before February 28, unless written request for
thirty days extension is made to and granted by the Administrator following any
calendar year in which such deductions have been made or should have been made
by such employer shall file with the Administrator an information return
(Worthington Withholding Statement of Wages Paid, and Worthington Income Tax
Withheld), for each employee from whom income tax has been or should have been
withheld, showing the name and address of the employee, the total amount of
salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation paid said employee during
the year, and the amount of City income tax withheld from each employee.
   (g)   Where a resident of the City performs service for his employer in
another municipality, which services are subject to withholding in the other
municipality, the employer shall have the authority to reduce the withholding
to the City to the extent of the tax liability in the other municipality.
   (h)   The officer or the employee having control or supervision of or
charged with the responsibility of filing the report and making payment is
personally liable for failure to file the report or pay the tax due as required
by this section. The dissolution of a corporation does not discharge an
officer's or employee's liability for a prior failure of the corporation to
file returns or pay tax due.
(Ord. 03-2010. Passed 6-7-10.)
 
   1703.07 DECLARATIONS.
   Every person who anticipates any taxable income which is not subject to
Section
1703.06 hereof, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or
activity subject to the tax imposed by Section
 1703.01(c) inclusive and Section
 1703.01(d) hereof shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income
or the estimated profit or loss from such business activity together with the
estimated tax due thereon, if any; provided, however, if a person's income is
wholly from qualified wages, salaries, commissions or other compensation from
which the tax will be withheld and remitted to the City in accordance with
Section
1703.06 hereof, such person need not file a declaration. If the estimated tax
for the current year, less the tax to be withheld and less such tax credit,
amounts to not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), no declaration or
payment of estimated tax is required.
   Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 15 of each year during
the life of this Taxation Code, or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
fourth month the taxpayer becomes subject to the tax for the first time. Those
taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration on or
before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
   Such a declaration shall be filed upon a form furnished by or obtainable
from the Department of Taxation or an acceptable generic form, provided,
however, credit shall be taken for the City tax to be withheld from any portion
of such income. In accordance with the provisions of Section
1703.06 hereof, credit may be taken for tax to be paid to or to be withheld and
remitted to another taxing municipality.
   The original declaration, or any subsequent amendment thereof, may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided for herein.
   Such declarations of estimated tax to be paid the City shall be accompanied
by a payment of at least one-fourth of the estimated annual tax and at least a
similar amount shall be paid on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
seventh, tenth and thirteenth months after the beginning of the taxable year.
Provided, however, that in case an amended declaration has been filed, the
unpaid balance shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which such declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due the City shall be
paid therewith in accordance with the provisions of Section
1703.04 hereof.
   A declaration of estimated tax which is less than eighty percent (80%) of
the tax shown on the final return shall not be considered filed in good faith.
The difference shall be subject to penalties and interest as provided for in
Chapter
1709.

   (A)    For residents of the City, the income tax levied herein shall be on
all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. This
is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
1715.01(C)(16)).
   (B)    For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages,
commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the City, including any net profit of the nonresident, but
excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net profit or loss of
only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by the nonresident.
   (C)    For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to "Municipal
Taxable Income" as defined in Section
1715.01(C)(21). Exemptions which may apply are specified in Section
1715.01(C)(12).
Refundable credit for Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan.
   (D)   (1)    As used in this division:
                  (a)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a
compensation plan described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue
Code.
                   (b)    "Qualifying loss" means the amount of compensation
attributable to a taxpayer's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the
receipt of money and property attributable to distributions from the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Full loss is sustained if no
distribution of money and property is made by the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan. The taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable
year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to that nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
                (c)   (i)    "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax
rate for the taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to the
City with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
            (ii)    If different tax rates applied for different taxable years,
then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the City each
year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (d)    "Refundable credit" means the amount of the City income tax
that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    If, in addition to the City, a taxpayer has paid tax to other
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal
corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's
proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
           (3)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the City
for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
         (4)    The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
                  (a)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
                  (b)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of
the employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified
deferred compensation.
Domicile.
   (E)   (1)   (a)    An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the City for
all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the City on
the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if the Tax
Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in the City
for all or part of the taxable year.
                   (b)    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile
described in division (E)(1)(a) of this section if the individual establishes
by a preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
City for all or part of the taxable year.
           (2)    For the purpose of determining whether an individual is
domiciled in the City for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be
considered include, but are not limited to, the following:
                   (a)    The individual's domicile in other taxable years;
                   (b)    The location at which the individual is registered to
vote;
                   (c)    The address on the individual's driver's license;
                   (d)    The location of real estate for which the individual
claimed a property tax exemption or reduction allowed on the basis of the
individual's residence or domicile;
                   (e)    The location and value of abodes owned or leased by
the individual;
         (f)    Declarations, written or oral, made by the individual regarding
the individual's residency;
                   (g)    The primary location at which the individual is
employed.
                   (h)    The location of educational institutions attended by
the individual's dependents as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue
Code, to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based
on the residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
                   (i)    The number of contact periods the individual has with
the City. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact
period" with the City if the individual is away overnight from the individual's
abode located outside of the City and while away overnight from that abode
spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two consecutive days
in the City.
           (3)    All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules
and Regulations.
         (Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
Businesses.
   (F)    This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the City, unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
City or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or telephone
company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter 5745. of
the ORC.
           (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (F)(2) and (G) of
this section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within
and without the boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
                  (a)    The average original cost of the real property and
tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost
of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer
in the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
                  (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the taxable period to individuals employed in the business or profession for
services performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
1717.01(C);
                  (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession
from sales and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in
the City to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same
period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
          (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)
(1) of this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the City, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
City may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of
the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one
or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
                  (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment
method shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed
appeal of an assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may
use the requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the
request in an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
 1719.01(A).
                  (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
1719.01(A).
                  (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies
or otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the
Tax Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
         (3)    As used in division (F)(1)(b) of this section, "wages,
salaries, and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other
compensation paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following
locations:
         (a)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            (i)    The employer;
            (ii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or
a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            (iii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person
described in division (F)(3)(a)(ii) of this section, or a related member of
such a vendor, customer, client, or patient.
                  (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing,
investigation, inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative,
judicial, or legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that
the compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the
employer or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly
benefits the employer;
                  (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator
determines that the employer directed the employee to perform the services at
the other location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or
(b) of this section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal
income tax liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the
employer may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
          (4)    For the purposes of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
except as provided in division (G) of this section, receipts from sales and
rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation
as follows:
                  (a)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale
originated. For the purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in
the City if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
            (i)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the City from
a stock of goods located within the City.
            (ii)    The property is delivered within the City from a location
outside the City, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            (iii)    The property is shipped from a place within the City to
purchasers outside the City, provided that the taxpayer is not, through its own
employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the
place where delivery is made.
         (b)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
the City to the extent that such services are performed in the City.
                  (c)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from
the sale of real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
                  (d)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from
rents and royalties from real property located in the City shall be sitused to
the City.
                   (e)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible
personal property shall be sitused to the City based upon the extent to which
the tangible personal property is used in the City.
          (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the
rental of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded
entity owned by the individual, shall be subject to the City's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the City or if the individual
taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the City. The City shall
allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for the purpose of
calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal corporation
in which the property is located.
          (6)   (a)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the City, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the City
to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
                 (b)    An individual who is a resident of the City shall
report the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the
individual's annual tax return for the City. The individual may claim a credit
for taxes the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal
corporation to the extent that such a credit is allowed under the City's income
tax ordinance.
         (7)    When calculating the ratios described in division (F)(1) of
this section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this
section, the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios
the property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (G)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
1717.01, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of
personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(F)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
1717.01.

Withholding provisions.
   (A)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the City shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in the City. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
1716.01 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
 1716.01 of this Part Seventeen - Title Two, of two and one half percent
(2.5%). An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and
withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or
other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages
to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the City the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld
or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer,
agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the City in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the City in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded $200.
Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made the Tax
Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month for which
the tax was withheld.
          (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not
required to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the last day of the month following the last day
of each calendar quarter.
         (c)    Notwithstanding the provisions of Section (B)(1)(a)and (b) of
this section, taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
semimonthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld
or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the City in the preceding
calendar year exceeded $11,999, or if in any month of the preceding calendar
year exceeded $1,000. Payment under division (B)(1)(c) of this section shall be
made to the Tax Administrator not later than one of the following: i) if the
taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld during
the first fifteen days of a month, the third banking day after the fifteenth
day of that month; (ii) if the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to
be deducted and withheld after the fifteenth day of a month and before the
first day of the immediately following month, the third banking day after the
last day of the month.
           (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is
required to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal
taxes withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal
Revenue Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation,
the payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator
of all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
          (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make
and file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator and the City as the return
required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this Part Seventeen - Title Two is the qualifying wages reported by the
employee's employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
          (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not
required to withhold the City income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
          (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by
the failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold
the tax as required under this Part Seventeen - Title Two or by the employer's,
agent's, or other payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
                  (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer to remit to the City the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
          (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
the City income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
          (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required
to withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
          (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an
employer shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax
Administrator listing:
                  (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of
all employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City during the preceding calendar year;
                  (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such
employee, the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the
preceding calendar year;
                  (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for
which tax was withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during
the preceding calendar year;
                 (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax
reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form
with respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
          (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
          (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Part Seventeen - Title Two, to be tax required to be
withheld and remitted for the purposes of this section.
Occasional Entrant - Withholding.
 
   (C)   (1)    As used in this division:
                  (a)    "Employer" includes a person that is a related member
to or of an employer.
             (b)    "Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing business
in this state, such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar location
owned or controlled by an employer.
                  (c)    "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to
which an employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and
ordinary basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties
on a regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work"
means the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to
report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee
is not required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis
to a fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal

reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal

be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal

          (2)   (a)   Subject to divisions (C)(3), (5), (6), and (7) of this
section, an employer is not required to withhold the City income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the City if the employee performed such services in the City on 20 or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the
City.
            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the City. For the purposes of this division, "presumed

that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
1717.01.
            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
                  (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this
section, an employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing
services in the City only if the employee spent more time performing services
for or on behalf of the employer in the City than in any other municipal
corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an
employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more
of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the
employee's principal place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)    Traveling from any location to another location in order

another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer shall
withhold and remit tax to the City for any subsequent days in that calendar
year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal
services performed in the City.
                  (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the
City under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
City for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in the City.
          (5)    If an employer's fixed location is in the City and the
employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
1715.01, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
City, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the City.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, a the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
1717.01.

   1718.01 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)    An annual City income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every individual taxpayer eighteen (18) years of age or older and any taxpayer
that is not an individual for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is
subject to the tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
1717.01 of this Part Seventeen - Title Two when the nonresident individual
taxpayer's sole income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by
the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is
due the City.
      (2)    Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for City income tax
purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which
retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the City, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this Part
Seventeen - Title Two.
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the City, the return or notice required of that individual shall be
completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent, guardian,
conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the person or
property of that individual.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.
   (E)    The City shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; or,
in the case of a return or request required by a qualified municipal
corporation, Ohio form IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any
other documentation necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended
return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return required by this
section electronically is not required to provide paper copies of any of the
foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such
copies after the return has been filed.
             (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the City to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal
income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of this
section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on
a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
   (G)   (1)   (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this Part Seventeen -
Title Two, each individual income tax return required to be filed under this
section shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or
before the date prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax
returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall
complete and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax
Administrator or on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the
City. No remittance is required if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
         (b)    Except as otherwise provided in this Part Seventeen - Title
Two, each annual net profit return required to be filed under this section by a
taxpayer that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by
the Tax Administrator on or before the fifteenth day (15th) of the fourth month
following the end of the taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the City. No
remittance is required if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
           (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City's income tax
return. The extended due date of the City's income tax return shall be the 15th
day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
                  (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be
included with the filing of the City's income tax return.
                  (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-
month extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit
a written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's City income tax return. If the
request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the City
income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's
requested extension.
           (3)    If the state tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the
date for filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08
of the ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing
of the City's income tax return. The extended due date of the City's income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
           (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the City, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
        (5)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a
municipal income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section,
the tax administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the
taxpayer with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the
return or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever
occurs first.
         If a tax administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
           (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
         (Ord. 34-2023. Passed 12-4-23.)
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the City shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars or less.
            (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the City for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
City an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section, unless
the provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
           (3)   (a)    A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the
person does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the City income tax
ordinance for a taxable year if both the following apply:
              (i)    The person was required to file a tax return with the City
for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location (as defined in
1717.01(C)(1)(g)) within the City.
              (ii)    The person no longer provides services in the City and
does not expect to be subject to the City income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)    The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the City. The affidavit shall also include
the following statement; "The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within the City, make any sales in the City, or otherwise become subject to the
tax levied by the City for the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject
to the lax levied by the City for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be
considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the City income
tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The person shall sign the affidavit
under penalty of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b) the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a tax return for
the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)    Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)    If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for the City an employer, the agent of an employer, or
other payer as described in Section
 1717.01 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the City, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the City and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the City to be filed in accordance with this
division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the City
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Part
Seventeen - Title Two and of the City's ordinance, resolution, or rules and
regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the City's
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
            (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may
report the amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and
may make remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
           (3)    Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing
employer withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the City for
both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by the City during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty
terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
           (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day
after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
           (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division
(O)(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not
require any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes
for the extension period.
   (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
           (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension
under the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in
which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of
time in which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation
in accordance with this Part Seventeen - Title Two. The length of any extension
granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length
of the corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal
Revenue Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of
the national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of
the United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
                 (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with
division (P)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)    For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
          (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
           (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (R)
(1) of this section.
           (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.
           (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
           (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal
income tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following
the last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
           (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section
is binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the City. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated City
income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated City income tax
return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and
receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate
return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
    (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated City income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States department of treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
1715.01, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
           (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (2)(C)(1) of this
section to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to
the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
           (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
1718.01, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
1718.01 include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not
be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
          (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
1718.01, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Part Seventeen - Title
Two on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included
in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated City income tax return shall make
the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
1718.01 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the City in accordance with this Part Seventeen -
Title Two on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with the City may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   1718.02 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the City who is required to
and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this Part Seventeen - Title Two
may claim a nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to
the other municipality. Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit
shall not exceed the tax due the City under this Part Seventeen - Title Two.
   (B)    The City shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the City who works in a joint economic development zone created under
Section 715.691 of the ORC or a joint economic development district created
under Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it
grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
    (D)    Intentionally left blank.
(Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
   1718.03 ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
           (1)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer
reasonably estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the City's income
tax for the current taxable year.
           (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the City for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for the City from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the City in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
           (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations
of estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed
by the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
           (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or
before the date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under
division (G) of Section
1718.01 or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
           (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
           (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City, including
the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
          (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month
after the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent
(22.5%) of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent (67.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    For an individual, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
first month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year. For a person other than an individual, on or
before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of the taxable year,
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable year.
           (2)    When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
           (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of
the year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was
filed, an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall
be paid with the return in accordance with Section
 1718.01.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
1720.06 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
           (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
one hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the
taxpayer for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately
preceding taxable year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer
filed a return with the City under Section
1718.01 for that year.
           (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
   1718.04 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Part Seventeen - Title Two. Any fractional part of a dollar that
equals or exceeds fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and
any fractional part of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped.
If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall
round all amounts entered on the document. (Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
   1718.05 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
 1720.06.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
           (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
           (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten
dollars or more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Part Seventeen - Title
Two, requests for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form
prescribed by the Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or
paid, whichever is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to
file with the request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's
claim for a refund.
           (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (C)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall
issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was
denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the
assessment.
           (3)    If the Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
1722.01. 
    (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for
filing specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have
been filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
           (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the
earliest postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed
is not later than the last day for filing the request.
           (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only
postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private
postal meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for
filing the request, and the request is received within seven days of such last
day.
           (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark
date was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of
the postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within
seven days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
1720.06(A)(4). (Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
   1718.06 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR
REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the City, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City as a refund
but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City is subject to recovery by the City. If the
City's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a refund
of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the City shall allow
a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the City claims is due
with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to
the first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)    If the City's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City's tax rate. However, if the City's tax rate is greater than the tax rate
in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is
to be paid to the City, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during
the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.   
(Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
   1718.07 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the City changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
City. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
1719.01 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the City. A request filed under this division shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
1718.05.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.   
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability, that taxpayer shall
make and file an amended City return showing income subject to City income tax
based upon such final determination of federal or state tax liability. The
taxpayer shall pay any additional City income tax shown due thereon or make a
claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than
ten dollars.

                (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying
deferral period, if any.

time limit described in division (C) of this section.
           (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
                   (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
1722.01. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding,
or holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
                 (b)    Ending the later of the 60th day after the date on
which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the 60th
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
    (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or

the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought

1718.05.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
           (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
1718.05, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
 1718.05.
   (E)    No civil action to recover City income tax or related penalties or

   1720.01 AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
   1720.02 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
           (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator
has at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address
the Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
           (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
                   (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other City official, or
the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the Board of Tax Review within 60 days after the receipt
of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under
division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is
complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
           (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis
described in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject
to collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City official,
or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division prevents
the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with
the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the Board
of Tax Review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator

CHAPTER.
   (A)    A taxpayer may elect to be subject to this Chapter
1727 in lieu of the provisions set forth in the remainder of Part Seventeen -
Title Two. Notwithstanding any other provision of Part Seventeen - Title Two,
upon the taxpayer's election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)    The state tax commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator
of the municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer as defined in Section
 1727.02(C) of the Codified Ordinances is liable for the term of the election;
      (2)    The commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to Part
Seventeen - Title Two, Sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Ohio Revised Code, and
any applicable provision of Chapter 5703 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the tax commissioner and the City on a form prescribed by the tax
commissioner.
       (2)   (a)    The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the
taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the tax commissioner and the City of its
termination of the election.
         (b)    A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (c)    Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the
taxpayer is no longer subject to Chapter
1727, and is instead subject to the provisions set forth in the remainder of
Title Two of Part Seventeen of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)    The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer Chapter
1727. In addition to any other powers conferred upon the tax commissioner by
law, the tax commissioner may:
      (1)    Prescribe all forms necessary to administer those sections;
      (2)    Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)    Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out
the duties imposed upon the tax commissioner by those sections.
   (D)    The tax commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as
that term is defined in Section 718.01 of the Ohio Revised Code and Section
1715.01(C)(45)(a) of the Codified Ordinances. (Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
   1727.02 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Chapter
1727 that is not otherwise defined in Title Two of Part Seventeen is used in a
comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Ohio Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703 of the
Ohio Revised Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control.
Any reference in this Part Seventeen - Title Two to the Internal Revenue Code
includes other laws of the United States related to federal income taxes. If a
term is defined in both this section and Section
1715.01 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall
control for all uses of that term in Chapter
1727.
   As used in Chapter
1727 only:
   (A)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
 1727.03, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net operating loss
carryforward available to the person for the municipal corporation.
   (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of Section 718.01 of the Ohio Revised Code
1715.01(C)(24)(e), means a C corporation's federal taxable income before net
operating losses and special deductions as determined under the Internal
Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in Section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under Section 4313.02
of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (V)(3)(b) of
Section
1718.01.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (V)(3)(b) of Section
1718.01.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (C)(48)(b) of 1715.01, and is not a
publicly traded partnership that has made the election described in division
(C)(24)(e) of Section
1715.01, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal taxable income under this
section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except guaranteed payments and
other similar amounts paid or accrued to a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deductible expense unless such payments are in consideration for the use
of capital and treated as payment of interest under Section 469 of the Internal
Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to
a qualified self-employed retirement plan with respect to a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of the
taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and
amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.
Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
1715.01(C)(48), except that "taxpayer" does not include natural persons or
entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745 of the Ohio Revised
Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy
when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Chapter
1727 for the purpose of reporting municipal income taxes, and includes
declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this Part Seventeen - Title Two. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for
federal income tax purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Chapter
1727 is changed accordingly but may consist of an aggregation of more than one
taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The tax commissioner may
prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable year for a taxpayer that
has had a change of its taxable year for federal income tax purposes, for a
taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years for federal income tax
purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for a new taxpayer that
would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section
1727.11.
      (Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
   1727.03 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the City and that has made the election under Section
1727.01.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
 1717.01(C);
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the City, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may require, that
the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
1719.01.
       (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
1719.01.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the City as
follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the City only if, regardless of where title passes, the property
meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the City from a
stock of goods located within the City.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the City from a location
outside the City, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
City to the extent that such services are performed in the City.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the City.
   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the City in which
the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent or
broker shall be allocated to the City based upon the ratio of the commissions
the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
located in the City to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or
lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (C)(12) and (R)(1)(d) of Section 718.01 of the Ohio
Revised Code by another municipal corporation, the taxpayer shall add the
amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was
apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City under this
section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
   1727.04  INFORMATION PROVIDED TO TAX ADMINISTRATORS; CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by Chapter
1727 is confidential, and no person shall disclose such information, except for
official purposes, in accordance with a proper judicial order, or as provided
in Section 4123.271 or 5703.21 of the Ohio Revised Code. The tax commissioner
may furnish the internal revenue service with copies of returns filed. This
section does not prohibit the publication of statistics in a form which does
not disclose information with respect to particular taxpayers.
   (B)    In May and November of each year, the tax commissioner shall provide
the City tax administrator with the following information for every taxpayer
that filed tax returns with the commissioner under Chapter

Part Seventeen - Title Two for any prior year:
      (1)    The taxpayer's name, address, and federal employer identification
number;
      (2)    The taxpayer's apportionment ratio for, and amount of municipal
taxable income apportionable to, the City pursuant to Section
 1727.03;

       (5)    The amount of any credit claimed under Section 718.94 of the Ohio
Revised Code.
   (C)    Not later than thirty days after each distribution made to municipal
corporations under Section 718.83 of the Ohio Revised Code, the tax
commissioner shall provide to the City a report stating the name and federal
identification number of every taxpayer that made estimated payments that are
attributable to the City and the amount of each such taxpayer's estimated
payment.
   (D)    The information described under divisions (B) and (C) of this section
shall be provided to the individual or individuals designated by the City tax
administrator under Section 718.83(D) of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (E)   (1)    The City expects that the tax commissioner will, pursuant to
Section 718.84(E) of the Ohio Revised Code, provide tax returns and other
information it receives in the performance of its administration of the
municipal net profits tax for taxpayers making the election provided in Section
1727.01. The tax administrator shall review these returns and information, as
well as the information received pursuant to divisions (B) and (C) of this
section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer for audit by the tax
commissioner. Such referral shall be made on a form prescribed by the
commissioner and shall include any information that forms the basis for the
referral.
      (2)    If the tax commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the tax administrator under this section, the City reserves its right to pursue
any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the correct
tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.
         (Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
   1727.05 FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   (1)   For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual
return. Such return, along with the amount of tax shown to be due on the return
less the amount paid for the taxable year under Section
1727.09, shall be submitted to the tax commissioner, on a form and in the
manner prescribed by the commissioner, on or before the fifteenth day of the
fourth month following the end of the taxpayer's taxable year.
      (2)    If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one
calendar year, the taxpayer shall aggregate the facts and figures necessary to
compute the tax due under this Part Seventeen - Title Two, in accordance with
Sections
1727.02,
1727.03, and, if applicable,
1727.07 onto its annual return.
      (3)    The remittance shall be made payable to the treasurer of state and
in the form prescribed by the tax commissioner. If the amount payable with the
tax return is ten dollars or less, no remittance is required.
   (B)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall

         (b)    A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically
through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the tax
commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission
is not available, mail the documents to the tax commissioner. The department of
taxation shall publish a method of electronically submitting the documents
required under this division on or before January 1, 2019.
      (3)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the tax commissioner may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal income tax.
   (D)   (1)   (a)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the
commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)    An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with Section 718.04 of the Ohio Revised
Code, the commissioner may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments
otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not otherwise
required to file annual returns.
    (E)    Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the tax commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (F)    When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
(Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
   1727.06 ELECTRONIC FILING. 
   (A)    All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under Section
1727.01 shall file any tax return or extension for filing a tax return, and
shall make payment of amounts shown to be due on such returns, electronically,
either through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by
the tax commissioner.
   (B)    A taxpayer may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the
commissioner, to be excused from the requirement to file returns and make
payments electronically. For good cause shown, the commissioner may excuse the
applicant from the requirement and permit the applicant to file the returns or
make the payments by nonelectronic means.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may adopt rules establishing the following:
      (1)    The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns

electronic means. (Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
   1727.07  CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
1727.01, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division (B)(1) or (2) of
Section
1727.07 is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of the five-year
period.
      (5)    When an election made under Section
 1727.01 is terminated, a valid election made under this section is binding
upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
    (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same
manner as is required under the United States department of treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
1727.02(B), by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of Section
1727.02 to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to
the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
1727.03, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
1727.03, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in Section
1727.03, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Chapter
1727 on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included
in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
1727.03 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Section
1727.01 to
1727.16 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703 of the Ohio Revised Code to
the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for
any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an
affiliated group.
(Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
   1727.08 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
1727.01 fails to pay any tax as required under Chapter
1727, or any portion of that tax, on or before the date prescribed for its
payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in the same manner as
the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum prescribed by Section
5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code from the date prescribed for its payment until
it is paid or until the date an assessment is issued under Section
1727.11, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
   1727.09 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
       (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before
the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year
or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer
becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of Section 718.85 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
Section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for
the period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause
as described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment
shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Chapter
1727 and shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in
accordance with Section 718.83 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
   1727.10  ADDITIONAL PENALTIES. 
   (A)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by Part Seventeen - Title
Two or Chapter 5703 of the Ohio Revised Code, the following penalties shall
apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Chapter
1727 fails to make and file the return within the time prescribed, including
any extensions of time granted by the tax commissioner, the commissioner may
impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five dollars per month or fraction of a
month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between the due date,
including extensions of the due date, and the date on which the return is
filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this division shall not
exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Chapter
1727 fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a penalty not to exceed the
following:
          (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return;
         (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
1727.01 fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be paid under this
Part Seventeen - Title Two, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to
fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Chapter
1727 that does not contain information upon which the substantial correctness
of the return may be judged or contains information that on its face indicates
that the return is substantially incorrect, and the filing of the return in
that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a desire that is apparent
from the return to delay or impede the administration of Chapter
1727, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Chapter
1727, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of one thousand
dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section
1727.12 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
Section
1727.11 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for
the assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Chapter
1727 and shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in the
same proportion as the underlying tax liability is required to be distributed
to such municipal corporations under Section 718.83 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
   1727.11  ASSESSMENTS. 
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under Chapter
1727 fails to file the return within the time prescribed, files an incorrect
return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for the period covered
by the return, the tax commissioner may make an assessment against the taxpayer
for any deficiency for the period for which the return or tax is due, based
upon any information in the commissioner's possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Section
1719.01 for the same period of time. There shall be no bar or limit to an
assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject to assessment
as required by Chapter
1727, or that files a fraudulent return. The commissioner shall give the
taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided in Section
5703.37 of the Ohio Revised Code. With the notice, the commissioner shall
provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing
on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under Section
5703.60 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by Section 5703.47 of
the Ohio Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until
the assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under Section 131.02 of the Ohio Revised Code, whichever comes
first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney
general for collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by Section 5703.47 of the Ohio
Revised Code from the date of certification until the date it is paid in its
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be
collected by issuing an assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
    (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in Section 5703.37
of the Ohio Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the
clerk. The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the
taxpayer assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division
(B) of this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the
commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the
assessment. Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the
commissioner's consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section
1727.12, with interest on that amount as provided by that section.
(Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
   1727.12 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Chapter
1727, including assessments, shall be filed with the tax commissioner within
three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of
the tax, or within any additional period allowed by division (A) of Section
1719.01. The application shall be filed in the form prescribed by the tax
commissioner.
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in Section 5703.052 of the Ohio Revised Code. If the amount is greater
than ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with Section 5703.70 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under Section 718.83 of the Ohio
Revised Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by Section 5703.47 of the Ohio
Revised Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day
the refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
   1727.13  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under Section
1727.01 and used to determine the tax due under Chapter
1727 must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal
income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the internal revenue
service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax liability under those
sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the tax commissioner
in such form as the commissioner requires. The amended return shall be filed
not later than sixty days after the adjustment is agreed upon or finally
determined for federal income tax purposes or after any federal income tax
deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting therefrom, has been
assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer intends to file an
amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of
return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's
consolidated federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the
commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
1727.11 for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due under this section,
together with any applicable penalty and interest. The amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return no longer subject to assessment that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
1727.12, if the application otherwise conforms to the requirements of that
section. An application filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time prescribed in
Section
1727.05. The application shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations,
or attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return.
(Ord. 06-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
   1727.14  EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND PERSONS.
   (A)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Chapter
1727 for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as required under those sections.
Upon written request by the commissioner or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every taxpayer or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to
investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal and state
income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to Chapter
1727 shall be open to the tax commissioner's inspection during business hours
and shall be preserved for a period of six years following the end of the
taxable year to which the records or documents relate, unless the commissioner,
in writing, consents to their destruction within that period, or by order
requires that they be kept longer. The commissioner may require any person, by
notice served on that person, to keep such records as the commissioner
determines necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the
extent of such liability, for the income tax levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other

   (a)   Effective January 1, 2006 for the purpose of providing revenue with
which to meet the needs of the City for the use of the General Fund of the
City, and for the purpose of providing revenue to enhance the City’s appeal to
visitors and tourists and for the purpose of providing revenue to promote and

transactions by which lodging by a hotel or transient accommodation is or is to

(C) (1).
(Ord. 49-2005. Passed 11-7-05.)
 
   (b)   The tax applies and is collectible at the time the lodging is

to lodging furnished to the State, or any of its political subdivisions, or any
charitable organization for the lodging of transient indigent individuals.
 
   (c)   For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter, and to
prevent the evasion of the tax, it is presumed that all lodging furnished by
hotels or transient accommodations in this City to transient guests is subject
to tax until the contrary is established.

each year prior to the budget hearings to the City Manager by a date to be
established by the City Manager. The proposals shall be presented to Council
during the annual budget hearings, during which a representative of each
applicant shall be present to discuss its proposal. Council shall review and
approve, modify or disapprove the proposals at the same time that the annual
City budget is approved. Council may also provide an opportunity for further
applications for funding throughout the year, in its discretion, if tax
revenues are available.
 
   (f)   Each recipient organization of funds pursuant to this section shall
within 120 days after the end of their fiscal year provide to the Finance
Director financial statements of the organization for such fiscal year prepared
in accordance with standards set forth by the Director of Finance.
(Ord. 4-93. Passed 1-25-93.)
 
   1728.03 TRANSIENT GUEST TO PAY TAX.
   (a)   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient guest
to the vendor, and each vendor shall collect from the transient guest the full
and exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging.
 
   (b)   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest shall
furnish to the vendor, and the vendor shall obtain from the transient guest, a
statement specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax. If no statement is obtained, it shall be presumed the tax applies.
(Ord. 4-93. Passed 1-25-93.)
 
   1728.04 REFUND OF ILLEGAL OR ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS.
   The Finance Director shall refund to vendors the amount of taxes paid
illegally or erroneously or paid on any illegal or erroneous assessment where
the vendor has not reimbursed himself from the transient guest. When such
illegal or erroneous payment or assessment was not paid to a vendor but was
paid by the transient guest directly to the Finance Director, he shall refund
the appropriate amount to the transient guest. Applications shall be filed with
the Finance Director on the form prescribed by him, within ninety days from the
date it is ascertained that the assessment or payment was illegal or erroneous.
However, in any event such application for refund shall be filed with the
Finance Director within four years from the date of the illegal or erroneous
payment of the tax. On filing of such application, the Finance Director shall
determine the amount of refund due and draw a warrant for such amount to the
person claiming such refund. The Finance Director shall make such payments from
a Tax Refund Account as established by this chapter and the same is hereby
established.
(Ord. 4-93. Passed 1-25-93.)
 
   1728.05 REQUIRED RECORDS; INSPECTION AND DESTRUCTION.
   Each vendor shall keep complete and accurate records of lodgings furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices and such other pertinent
documents. If the vendor furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the vendor's
records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale was
exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction if
exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be open
during business hours to the inspection of the Finance Director and shall be
preserved for a period of not less than four years, unless the Finance
Director, in writing, consents to their destruction within that period, or by
order requires that they be kept longer.
(Ord. 4-93. Passed 1-25-93.)
 
   1728.06 RETURNS REQUIRED.
   Each vendor shall file a monthly return on forms prescribed by the Finance
Director showing receipts from furnishing lodging, the amount of tax due from
the vendor to the City for the period covered by the return, and such other
information as the Finance Director deems necessary for the proper
administration of this chapter. The monthly return is due on or before the
fifteenth day of each month during a calendar year. The Finance Director may
extend the time for making and filing returns. Returns shall be filed by
mailing the same to the Finance Director, together with payment of the amount
of tax shown to be due thereon. The Finance Director shall stamp or otherwise
mark on all returns the date received by him and shall also show thereon by
stamp or otherwise the amount of payment received with the return. Any vendor
who fails to file a return under this chapter shall forfeit and pay into the
City Treasury the sum of one percent (1%) of the tax due. The Finance Director,
if he deems it necessary in order to insure the payment of the tax imposed by
this chapter, may require returns and payments to be made for other than
monthly periods. The returns shall be signed by the vendor or his authorized
agent.
(Ord. 4-93. Passed 1-25-93.)
 
   1728.07  LIABILITY, ASSESSMENT AND PETITION FOR REASSESSMENT; PENALTIES.
   (a)   If any vendor collects the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter
and fails to remit the same to the City as prescribed, he shall be personally
liable for any amount collected which he failed to remit. The Finance Director
may make an assessment against such vendor based upon any information in the
Finance Director's possession. If any vendor fails to collect the tax or any
transient guest fails to pay the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter on
any transaction subject to the tax, such vendor or transient guest shall be
personally liable for the amount of the tax applicable to the transaction. The
Finance Director may make an assessment against either the vendor or transient
guest, as the facts may require, based upon any information in his possession.
An assessment against a vendor in cases where the tax imposed by or pursuant to
this chapter has not been collected or paid, shall not discharge the transient
guest's liability to reimburse the vendor for the tax applicable to such
transaction.
 
   (b)   In each case the Finance Director shall give to the vendor or
transient guest assessed written notice of such assessment. Such notice may be
served upon the vendor or transient guest personally or by registered or
certified mail. An assessment issued against either, pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter, shall not be considered an election of remedies, nor a bar to
an assessment against the other for the tax applicable to the same transaction,
provided that no assessment shall be issued against any vendor or transient
guest for the tax due on a particular transaction if such tax has actually been
paid by another.
 
   (c)   The Finance Director may make an assessment against any vendor who
fails to file a return required by this chapter or fails to remit the proper
amount of tax in accordance with this chapter. When information in the
possession of the Finance Director indicates that the amount required to be
collected is, or should be, greater than the amount remitted by the vendor, the
Finance Director may, upon the basis of test checks of a vendor's business for
a representative period which are hereby authorized, determine the ratio which
the tax required to be collected under this chapter bears to the hotel's or
transient accommodations' lodgings which determination shall be the basis of an
assessment as herein provided in this chapter. Notice of such assessment shall
be made in the manner prescribed in this chapter.
 
   (d)   Unless the vendor or transient guest, to whom such notice of
assessment is directed, files within thirty days after service thereof, either
personally or by registered or certified mail, a petition in writing, verified
under oath by such vendor, transient guest or his authorized agent, having
knowledge of the facts, setting forth with particularity the items of the
assessment objected to, together with the reasons for such objections, such
assessment shall become conclusive and the amount thereof shall be due and
payable, from the vendor or transient guests so assessed, to the Finance
Director. When a petition for reassessment is filed, the Finance Director shall
assign a time and place for the hearing of same and shall notify the petitioner
thereof by registered or certified mail, but the Finance Director may continue
the hearings from time to time if necessary.
 
   (e)   A penalty of eighteen percent (18%) shall be added to the amount of
every assessment made under this chapter. The Finance Director may adopt and
promulgate rules and regulations providing for the remission of penalties added
to assessments made under this chapter.
 
   (f)   When any vendor or transient guest files a petition for reassessment
as provided in this chapter, the assessment made by the Finance Director,
together with penalties thereon, shall become due and payable within three days
after notice of the findings made at the hearing has been served, either
personally or by registered or certified mail, upon the party assessed.
(Ord. 4-93. Passed 1-25-93.)
 
   1728.08 FOUR-YEAR LIMITATION FOR ASSESSMENTS; EXCEPTIONS.
 
      (1)   When the Finance Director has substantial evidence of amounts of
taxes collected by a vendor from a transient guest's lodging which were not
returned to the I333iIP
      (2)   When the vendor assessed failed to file a return as required;
      (3)   When the Finance Director and the vendor or guest waive the
limitation in writing.
         (Ord. 4-93. Passed 1-25-93.)
 
   1728.09 TAX PAID BY TRANSIENT GUEST; FALSE EVIDENCE OF TAX-EXEMPT STATUS.
   No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact tax as required by
this chapter, or shall present to the vendor false evidence indicating that the
lodging as furnished is not subject to the tax.
(Ord. 4-93. Passed 1-25-93.)
 
   1728.10  VENDOR TO COLLECT TAX; PROHIBITION AGAINST REBATES.
   No vendor shall fail to collect the full and exact tax as required by this
chapter. No vendor shall refund, remit or rebate to a transient guest, either
directly or indirectly, any of the tax levied pursuant to this chapter, or make
in any form of advertising, verbal or otherwise, any statements which might
imply that he is absorbing the tax, or paying the tax for the transient guest
by an adjustment of prices, or furnishing lodging at a price including the tax,
or rebating the tax in any other manner.
(Ord. 4-93. Passed 1-25-93.)
 
   1728.11 REPORTS FILED; FRAUDULENT REPORTS.
   (a)   No person, including any officer of a corporation or employee of a
corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed
by this chapter, or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false or
fraudulent return, report or statement.
 
   (b)   If any vendor required to file monthly returns under this chapter
fails on two consecutive months or on three or more months within a twelve-
month period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax thereon, or if
any other vendor authorized by the Finance Director to file returns at less
frequent intervals, fails on two or more occasions within a twenty-four month
period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax due thereon, the
Finance Director may require such vendor to furnish security in an amount equal
to the average tax liability of the vendor for a period of one year, as
determined by the Finance Director from a review of returns or other
information pertaining to such vendor, which amount shall in no event be less
than one thousand dollars ($1,000). The security may be in the form of a
payment to be applied to pay the tax due on subsequent returns, or a corporate
surety bond, satisfactory to the Finance Director, conditioned upon payment of
the tax due with the returns from the vendor. The security shall be filed
within ten days following the vendor's receipt of the notice from the Finance
Director of its requirements.
 
   (c)   A corporate surety bond filed under this section shall be returned to
the vendor if, for a period of twelve consecutive months following the date the
bond was filed, the vendor has filed all returns and remitted payment therewith
within the time prescribed in this chapter.
(Ord. 4-93. Passed 1-25-93.)
 
   1728.12 PERSONAL LIABILITY OF CORPORATE OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES.
   If any vendor corporation required to file returns and to remit tax due to
the City under the provisions of the chapter, fails for any reason to make such
filing or payment, any of its officers or employees charged with the
responsibility of filing returns and making payments shall be personally liable
for such failure. The dissolution of a corporation shall not discharge an
officer's or employee's liability for a prior failure of the corporation to
file returns or remit tax due. The sum due for such liability may be collected
by assessment in the manner provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 4-93. Passed 1-25-93.)
 
   1728.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for a
first offense. For each subsequent offense such person shall, if a corporation,
be fined not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) nor more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00), or if an individual, or a member of a partnership,
firm or association, be fined not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), or imprisoned not more than sixty
days, or both, in addition to any other penalties as imposed by this chapter.
