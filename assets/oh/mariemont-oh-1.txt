the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
      (2)   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last
day for doing the act or before its usual closing time on that day, the act may

      (5)   When an act is to take effect or become operative from and after a

(R.C. § 1.15)
      (6)   If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from

originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.

   (B)   The reenactment, amendment, or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in division (C) below:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation, or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal; or

investigation, proceeding, or remedy may be instituted, continued, or enforced,
and the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment imposed, as if the ordinance had not
been repealed or amended.
   (C)   If the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment for any offense is reduced
by a reenactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(R.C. § 1.58)
   (D)   An ordinance which is reenacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(R.C. § 1.54)
(2000 Code, § 10.04)
§ 10.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (A)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
section or an inclusive group of sections, or of divisions or subdivisions of a
section, the reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any provision
of the section, sections, divisions, or subdivisions included in the reference.
   (B)   References in the code to action taken or authorized under designated
sections of the code include, in every case, action taken or authorized under
the applicable legislative provision which is superseded by this code.

   (C)   A reference to any portion of a provision of this code applies to all
reenactments or amendments thereof.

   (D)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(R.C. § 1.56)

the reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified, or renumbered, unless the subject matter has been
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
(2000 Code, § 10.05)
§ 10.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (A)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(R.C. § 1.51)
   (B)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of the legislative
authority are irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment
prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of the legislative authority, one amendment without reference to
another, the amendments are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may
be given to each. If the amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the
latest in date of enactment prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates
language deleted by an earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted
by an earlier amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.
Amendments are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably
be put into simultaneous operation.
(R.C. § 1.52)
   (C)   In the event of a conflict between any of the provisions of this code,
or between any of the provisions of this code and any standard code adopted by
the municipality pursuant to R.C. § 731.231, the provision that establishes the
higher or stricter standard shall control.
(2000 Code, § 10.06)
§ 10.07 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provisions of a section of this code or the application thereof to
any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
other provisions or applications of the section or related sections which can
be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end
the provisions are severable.
(R.C. § 1.50) (2000 Code, § 10.07)
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OFFICES.
   Reference to a public office or officer shall be deemed to apply to any
office, officer, or employee of the municipality exercising the powers, duties,
or functions contemplated in the provision, irrespective of any transfer of
functions or change in the official title of the functionary.
(2000 Code, § 10.08)
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered consisting of the misspelling of any
words, the omission of any words necessary to express the intention of the
provisions affected, the use of words to which no meaning can be attached, or
the use of a word when another word was clearly intended to express the
intention, the spelling shall be corrected, and the words supplied, omitted, or
substituted shall conform with the manifest intention, and the provision shall
have the same effect as though the correct words were contained in the text as
originally published. No alteration shall be made or permitted if any question
exists regarding the nature or extent of the error.
(2000 Code, § 10.09)
§ 10.10 ORDINANCES REPEALED.
   With the exception of any ordinances specifically saved by the municipality,
this code, from and after its effective date, shall contain all of the
provisions of a general nature pertaining to the subjects herein enumerated and
embraced. All prior ordinances pertaining to the subjects treated by this code
shall be deemed repealed from and after the effective date of this code of
ordinances.
(2000 Code, § 10.10)
§ 10.11 ORDINANCES UNAFFECTED.
   All ordinances of a temporary or special nature, all other ordinances
pertaining to subjects not enumerated and embraced in this code of ordinances,
and all ordinances specifically saved by the municipality shall remain in full
force and effect unless herein repealed expressly or by necessary implication.
(2000 Code, § 10.11)
§ 10.12 ORDINANCES SAVED.
   Whenever an ordinance by its nature either authorizes or enables the
legislative body, or a certain municipal officer or employee, to make
additional ordinances or regulations for the purpose of carrying out the
intention of the ordinance, all ordinances and regulations of a similar nature
serving the purpose, effected prior to the codification and not inconsistent
thereto, shall remain in effect and are saved.
(2000 Code, § 10.12)
§ 10.13 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
(2000 Code, § 10.13)
§ 10.14 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
(2000 Code, § 10.14)
§ 10.15 AMENDMENTS TO CODE; AMENDATORY LANGUAGE.
   (A)   Any chapter, section, or division amended or added to this code by

(2000 Code, § 10.15)
§ 10.16 STATUTORY REFERENCES.
   (A)   If a statutory cite is included in the history, located in parentheses
immediately following a division or section of this code, this indicates that
the text of the division or section is substantially equivalent to the
statutory provision.
  Example: (R.C. § 4511.02)
   (B)   If a statutory cite is set forth as a “statutory reference” following
the text of a section, this indicates that the reader should refer to that
statute for further information.

expressly made retrospective.
(R.C. § 1.48)

of the legislative authority, may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;

FEES; GENERALLY
§ 30.01 APPLICATION OF TITLE III.
   (A)   Title III of this code of ordinances is designed to include and
incorporate, insofar as it is practical, all legislation concerning the
organization, qualifications, appointment or election, terms of office,
compensation, and the powers and duties of the officials, boards, and bodies of
the village. Pertinent sections of the Ohio Revised Code relative to these
village offices and boards have been assembled and adopted as a part of this
Title. No material changes of the Revised Code sections referred to in the
legislative histories have been made. The purpose of including these sections
is to afford easy reference to the statutory provisions.
   (B)   In the interest of uniformity and consistency, all references to
“village”, as the term appears in the Revised Code, have been changed to read
“municipality” throughout this title; however, the provisions of this chapter
shall only apply to the administration of village local government.
(2000 Code, § 30.01)
§ 30.02 QUALIFICATIONS; OATHS.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B) below or in another
section of the Revised Code, each officer of the municipality or of any
department or board of the municipality, whether elected or appointed as a
substitute for a regular officer, shall be an elector of the municipality and,
before entering upon official duties, shall take an oath to support the
Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the state and an oath
that the officer will faithfully, honestly, and impartially discharge the
duties of the office to which elected or appointed. These provisions as to
official oaths shall extend to deputies, but they need not be electors.
   (B)   Neither this section nor any section of the Revised Code requires, or
shall be construed to require, that a Fire Chief be an elector of the
municipality.
(R.C. § 733.68) (2000 Code, § 30.02)
§ 30.03 BONDS OF OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES; AMOUNT.
   Before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, each officer and
employee, where such is required by the legislative authority, shall execute a
bond approved according to law in the amount set forth for his or her
respective office or position.
(2000 Code, § 30.03)
§ 30.04 ADDITIONAL BOND; WHERE BONDS RECORDED AND KEPT.
   Except as otherwise provided in the municipal charter or in R.C. § 3.061,
each officer required by law or ordinance to give bond shall do so before
entering upon the duties of the office. Except as otherwise provided in the
municipal charter or in R.C. § 3.061, the Legislative Authority may at any time
require each officer to give a new or additional bond. Each bond, except that
of the Auditor or Clerk, upon its approval, shall be delivered to the Auditor
or Clerk, who shall immediately record it in a record provided for that purpose
and file and carefully preserve it in the Auditor’s or Clerk’s office. The bond
of the Auditor or Clerk shall be delivered to the Treasurer, who shall in like
manner record and preserve it.
(R.C. § 733.69) (2000 Code, § 30.04)
§ 30.05 APPROVAL OF BONDS.
   The official bonds of all municipal officers shall be prepared by the
Village Solicitor. Except as otherwise provided in state law, the bonds shall
be in a sum as the legislative authority prescribes by general or special
ordinance, and be subject to the approval of the Mayor, except that the Mayor’s
bond shall be approved by the legislative authority, or, if it is not legally
organized, by the Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas of the county in which the
municipality or the larger part thereof is situated.
(R.C. § 733.70) (2000 Code, § 30.05)
§ 30.06 SUFFICIENCY OF FORM OF BOND.
   (A)   In each bond mentioned in §
30.05, the condition that the person elected or appointed shall faithfully
perform the duties of the office shall be sufficient.
   (B)   The fact that the instrument is without a seal; that blanks for the
date or amount have been filled subsequent to its execution, but before its
acceptance, without the consent of the sureties; that all the obligees named in
the instrument have not signed it; that new duties have been imposed on the
officers; or that any merely formal objection exists shall not be available in
any suit on the instrument.
(R.C. § 733.71) (2000 Code, § 30.06)
§ 30.07 FILLING VACANCIES IN OFFICES.
   Unless otherwise provided by law, vacancies arising in appointive and
elective offices of the municipality shall be filled by appointment by the
Mayor for the remainder of the unexpired term; provided, that:
   (A)   Vacancies in the office of the Mayor shall be filled in the manner
provided by R.C. § 733.25, or a substantially similar municipal ordinance;
   (B)   Vacancies in the membership of the legislative authority shall be
filled in the manner provided by R.C. § 731.43, or a substantially similar
municipal ordinance;
   (C)   Vacancies in the office of President Pro Tem of the legislative
authority shall be filled in the manner provided by R.C. § 731.11, or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance;
   (D)   Vacancies in the office of Clerk or Treasurer may be filled in the
following manner: the Mayor may appoint a person to serve as acting officer to
perform the duties of the office until a permanent officer is appointed to fill
the vacancy.
(R.C. § 733.31(A)) (2000 Code, § 30.07)
§ 30.08 PUBLIC RECORDS AVAILABLE.
   (A)   Upon request by any person and subject to division (H) of this
section, all public records responsive to the request shall be promptly
prepared and made available for inspection to the requester at all reasonable
times during regular business hours. Subject to division (H) of this section,
upon request by any person, a public office or person responsible for public
records shall make copies of the requested public record available to the
requestor at cost and within a reasonable period of time. If a public record
contains information that is exempt from the duty to permit public inspection
or to copy the public record, the public office or the person responsible for
the public record shall make available all of the information within the public
record that is not exempt. When making that public record available for public
inspection or copying that public record, the public office or the person
responsible for the public record shall notify the requester of any redaction
or make the redaction plainly visible. A redaction shall be deemed a denial of
a request to inspect or copy the redacted information, except if federal or
state law authorizes or requires a public office to make the redaction.
   (B)   To facilitate broader access to public records, a public office or the
person responsible for public records shall organize and maintain public
records in a manner that they can be made available for inspection or copying
in accordance with this section. A public office also shall have available a
copy of its current records retention schedule at a location readily available
to the public. If a requester makes an ambiguous or overly broad request or has
difficulty in making a request for copies or inspection of public records under
this section, such that the public office or the person responsible for the
requested public record cannot reasonably identify what public records are
being requested, the public office or the person responsible for the requested
public record may deny the request but shall provide the requester with an
opportunity to revise the request by informing the requester of the manner in
which records are maintained by the public office and accessed in the ordinary
course of the public office’s or person’s duties.
   (C)   If a request is ultimately denied, in part or in whole, the public
office or the person responsible for the requested public record shall provide
the requester with an explanation, including legal authority, setting forth why
the request was denied. If the initial request was provided in writing, the
explanation also shall be provided to the requester in writing. The explanation
shall not preclude the public office or the person responsible for the
requested public record from relying upon additional reasons or legal authority
in defending an action commenced under R.C. § 149.43(C).
   (D)   Unless specifically required or authorized by state or federal law or
in accordance this section, no public office or person responsible for public
records may limit or condition the availability of public records by requiring
disclosure of the requester’s identity or the intended use of the requested
public record. Any requirement that the requester disclose the requester’s
identity or the intended use of the requested public record constitutes a
denial of the request.
   (E)   A public office or person responsible for public records may ask a
requester to make the request in writing, may ask for the requester’s identity,
and may inquire about the intended use of the information requested, but may do
so only after disclosing to the requester that a written request is not
mandatory and that the requester may decline to reveal the requester’s identity
or the intended use and when a written request or disclosure of the identity or
intended use would benefit the requester by enhancing the ability of the public
office or person responsible for public records to identify, locate, or deliver
the public records sought by the requester.
   (F)   If any person requests a copy of a public record in accordance with
this section, the public office or person responsible for the public record may
require the requester to pay in advance the cost involved in providing the copy
of the public record in accordance with the choice made by the requester under
this division. The public office or the person responsible for the public
record shall permit the requester to choose to have the public record
duplicated upon paper, upon the same medium upon which the public office or
person responsible for the public record keeps it, or upon any other medium
upon which the public office or person responsible for the public record
determines that it reasonably can be duplicated as an integral part of the
normal operations of the public office or person responsible for the public
record. When the requester makes a choice under this division, the public
office or person responsible for the public record shall provide a copy of it
in accordance with the choice made by the requester. Nothing in this section
requires a public office or person responsible for the public record to allow
the requester of a copy of the public record to make the copies of the public
record.
   (G)   (1)   Upon a request made in accordance with this section and subject
to division (F) above, a public office or person responsible for public records
shall transmit a copy of a public record to any person by U.S. mail or by any
other means of delivery or transmission within a reasonable period of time
after receiving the request for the copy. The public office or person
responsible for the public record may require the person making the request to
pay in advance the cost of postage if the copy is transmitted by United States
mail or the cost of delivery if the copy is transmitted other than by U.S.
mail, and to pay in advance the costs incurred for other supplies used in the
mailing, delivery or transmission.
      (2)   Any public office may adopt a policy and procedures that it will
follow in transmitting, within a reasonable period of time after receiving a
request, copies of public records by United States mail or by any other means
of delivery or transmission pursuant to division (G) of this section. A public
office that adopts a policy and procedures under division (G) of this section
shall comply with them in performing its duties under that division.
      (3)   In any policy and procedures adopted under division (G) of this
section:
         (a)   A public office may limit the number of records requested by a
person that the office will physically deliver by United States mail or by
another delivery service to ten per month, unless the person certifies to the
office in writing that the person does not intend to use or forward the
requested records, or the information contained in them, for commercial
purposes.
         (b)   A public office that chooses to provide some or all of its
public records on a web site that is fully accessible to and searchable by
members of the public at all times, other than during acts of God outside the
public office’s control or maintenance, and that charges no fee to search,
access, download, or otherwise receive records provided on the web site, may
limit to ten per month the number of records requested by a person that the
office will deliver in a digital format, unless the requested records are not
provided on the web site and unless the person certifies to the office in
writing that the person does not intend to use or forward the requested
records, or the information contained in them, for commercial purposes.
         (c)   For purposes of division (G) of this section, COMMERCIAL shall
be narrowly construed and does not include reporting or gathering news,
reporting or gathering information to assist citizen oversight or understanding
the operation or activities of government, or nonprofit educational research.
   (H)   A public office or person responsible for public records is not
required to permit a person who is incarcerated pursuant to a criminal
conviction or a juvenile adjudication to inspect or to obtain a copy of any
public record concerning a criminal investigation or prosecution or concerning
what would be a criminal investigation or prosecution if the subject of the
investigation or prosecution were an adult, unless the request to inspect or to
obtain a copy of the record is for the purpose of acquiring information that is
subject to release as a public record under this section and the judge who
imposed the sentence or made the adjudication with respect to the person, or
the judge’s successor in office, finds that the information sought in the
public record is necessary to support what appears to be a justiciable claim of
the person.
   (I)   (1)   Upon written request made and signed by a journalist, a public
office, or person responsible for public records, having custody of the records
of the agency employing a specified designated public service worker, as
defined in R.C. § 149.43, shall disclose to the journalist the address of the
actual personal residence of the designated public service worker and, if the
designated public service worker’s spouse, former spouse or child is employed
by a public office, the name and address of the employer of the designated
public service worker’s spouse, former spouse or child. The request shall
include the journalist’s name and title and the name and address of the
journalist’s employer and shall state that disclosure of the information sought
would be in the public interest.
      (2)   Division (I)(1) of this section also applies to journalist requests
for:
         (a)   Customer information maintained by a municipally owned or
operated public utility, other than social security numbers and any private
financial information such as credit reports, payment methods, credit card
numbers, and bank account information.
         (b)    Information about minors involved in a school vehicle accident
as provided in division R.C. § 149.43(A)(1)(gg), other than personal
information as defined in R.C. § 149.45.
      (3)   As used in this division (I), JOURNALIST means a person engaged in,
connected with or employed by any news medium, including a newspaper, magazine,
press association, news agency,  or wire service, a radio or television
station, or a similar medium, for the purpose of gathering, processing,
transmitting, compiling, editing, or disseminating information for the general
public.
   (J)   Upon a request made by a victim, victim’s attorney, or victim’s
representative, as that term is used in R.C. § 2930.02, a public office or
person responsible for public records shall transmit a copy of a depiction of
the victim as described in R.C. § 149.43(A)(1)(ii) to the victim, victim’s
attorney, or victim’s representative.
   (K)   (1)   To ensure that all employees of public offices are appropriately
educated about a public office’s obligations under this section, all elected
officials or their appropriate designees shall attend training approved by the
Attorney General as provided in R.C. § 109.43. A future official may satisfy
the requirements of this division by attending the training before taking
office, provided that the future official may not send a designee in the future
official’s place.
      (2)   All public offices shall adopt a public records policy in
compliance with this section for responding to public records requests. In
adopting a public records policy under this division, a public office may
obtain guidance from the model public records policy developed and provided to
the public office by the Attorney General under R.C. § 109.43. Except as
otherwise provided in this section or R.C. § 149.43, the policy may not limit
the number of public records that the public office will make available to a
single person, may not limit the number of public records that it will make
available during a fixed period of time, and may not establish a fixed period
of time before it will respond to a request for inspection or copying of public
records, unless that period is less than eight hours.
      (3)   The public office shall distribute the public records policy
adopted by the public office under this division (K) to the employee of the
public office who is the records custodian or records manager or otherwise has
custody of the records of that office. The public office shall require that
employee to acknowledge receipt of the copy of the public records policy. The
public office shall create a poster that describes its public records policy
and shall post the poster in a conspicuous place in the public office and in
all locations where the public office has branch offices. The public office may
post its public records policy on the internet web site of the public office if
the public office maintains an internet web site. A public office that has
established a manual or handbook of its general policies and procedures for all
employees of the public office shall include the public records policy of the
public office in the manual or handbook.

§ 30.09 MEETINGS OF PUBLIC BODIES TO BE OPEN; EXCEPTIONS; NOTICE.
   (A)   This section shall be liberally construed to require public officials
to take official action and to conduct all deliberations upon official business
only in open meetings, unless the subject matter is specifically excepted by
law.
   (B)   As used in this section:
      MEETING. Any prearranged discussion of the public business of the public
body by a majority of its members.
      PUBLIC BODY. Any of the following:
         (a)   Any board, commission, committee, council, or similar decision-
making body of a state agency, institution, or authority, and any legislative
authority or board, commission, committee, council, agency, authority, or
similar decision-making body of any county, township, municipal corporation,

of a member of the board of directors of such a district pursuant to R.C. §
6115.10, if applicable, or for any other matter related to such a district
other than litigation involving the district. As used in this division (c),
COURT OF JURISDICTION has the same meaning as “court” in R.C. § 6115.01.
      PUBLIC OFFICE. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 149.011.
      REGULATED INDIVIDUAL. Either of the following:
         (a)   A student in a state or local public educational institution; or
         (b)   A person who is, voluntarily or involuntarily, an inmate,
patient or resident of a state or local institution because of criminal
behavior, mental illness, an intellectual disability, disease, disability, age,
or other condition requiring custodial care.
   (C)   (1)   All meetings of any public body are declared to be public
meetings open to the public at all times. A member of a public body shall be
present in person at a meeting open to the public to be considered present or
to vote at the meeting and for purposes of determining whether a quorum is
present at the meeting.
      (2)   The minutes of a regular or special meeting of any public body
shall be promptly prepared, filed, and maintained and shall be open to public
inspection. The minutes need only reflect the general subject matter of
discussions in executive sessions authorized under division (F) below.
   (D)   This section does not apply to any of the following: a grand jury; an
audit conference conducted by the auditor of state or independent certified
public accountants with officials of the public office that is the subject of
the audit; or to other entities as set forth in R.C. § 121.22(D) and (E).
   (E)   (1)   Every public body, by rule, shall establish a reasonable method
whereby any person may determine the time and place of all regularly scheduled
meetings and the time, place, and purpose of all special meetings. A public
body shall not hold a special meeting unless it gives at least 24 hours’
advance notice to the news media that have requested notification, except in
the event of an emergency requiring immediate official action. In the event of
an emergency, the member or members calling the meeting shall notify the news
media that have requested notification immediately of the time, place, and
purpose of the meeting.
      (2)   The rule shall provide that any person, upon request and payment of
a reasonable fee, may obtain reasonable advance notification of all meetings at
which any specific type of public business is to be discussed. Provisions for
advance notification may include, but are not limited to, mailing the agenda of
meetings to all subscribers on a mailing list or mailing notices in self-
addressed, stamped envelopes provided by the person.
   (F)   Except as provided division (F)(8) below, the members of a public body
may hold an executive session only after a majority of a quorum of the public
body determines, by a roll call vote, to hold an executive session and only at
a regular or special meeting for the sole purpose of the consideration of any
of the following matters:
      (1)   To consider the appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline,
promotion, demotion, or compensation of a public employee or official, or the
investigation of charges or complaints against a public employee, official,
licensee, or regulated individual, unless the public employee, official,
licensee, or regulated individual requests a public hearing. Except as
otherwise provided by law, no public body shall hold an executive session for
the discipline of an elected official for conduct related to the performance of
the elected official’s official duties or for the elected official’s removal
from office. If a public body holds an executive session pursuant to this
division (F)(1), the motion and vote to hold that executive session shall state
which one or more of the approved purposes listed in this division (F)(1) are
the purposes for which the executive session is to be held, but need not
include the name of any person to be considered at the meeting;
      (2)   (a)   To consider the purchase of property for public purposes, the
sale of property at competitive bidding, or the sale or other disposition of
unneeded, obsolete, or unfit-for-use property in accordance with R.C. § 505.10,
if premature disclosure of information would give an unfair competitive or
bargaining advantage to a person whose personal, private interest is adverse to
the general public interest. No member of a public body shall use this division
(F)(2) as a subterfuge for providing covert information to prospective buyers
or sellers. A purchase or sale of public property is void if the seller or
buyer of the public property has received covert information from a member of a
public body that has not been disclosed to the general public in sufficient
time for other prospective buyers and sellers to prepare and submit offers.
         (b)   If the minutes of the public body show that all meetings and
deliberations of the public body have been conducted in compliance with this
section, any instrument executed by the public body purporting to convey,
lease, or otherwise dispose of any right, title or interest in any public
property shall be conclusively presumed to have been executed in compliance
with this section insofar as title or other interest of any bona fide
purchasers, lessees, or transferees of the property is concerned.
      (3)   Conferences with an attorney for the public body concerning
disputes involving the public body that are the subject of pending or imminent
court action;
      (4)   Preparing for, conducting or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment;
      (5)   Matters required to be kept confidential by federal law or
regulations or state statutes;
      (6)   Details relative to the security arrangements and emergency
response protocols for a public body or a public office, if disclosure of the
matters discussed could reasonably be expected to jeopardize the security of
the public body or public office;
      (7)    In the case of a county hospital operated pursuant to R.C. Ch.
339, a joint township hospital operated pursuant to R.C. Ch. 513, or a
municipal hospital operated pursuant to R.C. Ch. 749, to consider trade
secrets, as defined in R.C. § 1333.61; and
      (8)   To consider confidential information related to the marketing
plans, specific business strategy, production techniques, trade secrets, or
personal financial statements of an applicant for economic development
assistance, or to negotiations with other political subdivisions respecting
requests for economic development assistance; provided, that both of the
following conditions apply:
         (a)   The information is directly related to a request for economic
development assistance that is to be provided or administered under any
provision of R.C. Ch. 715, 725, 1724, or 1728 or R.C. §§ 701.07, 3735.67 to
3735.70, 5709.40 to 5709.43, 5709.61 to 5709.69, 5709.73 to 5709.75, or 5709.77
to 5709.81, or that involves public infrastructure improvements or the
extension of utility services that are directly related to an economic
development project; or
         (b)   A unanimous quorum of the public body determines, by a roll call
vote, that the executive session is necessary to protect the interests of the
applicant or the possible investment or expenditure of public funds to be made
in connection with the economic development project.
      (9)   If a public body holds an executive session to consider any of the
matters listed in divisions (F)(2) through (F)(8) above, the motion and vote to
hold that executive session shall state which one or more of the approved
matters listed in those divisions are to be considered at the executive
session; or
      (10)   A public body specified in division (c) of the definition of
“public body” in this section shall not hold an executive session when meeting
for the purposes specified in that division (c).
   (G)   A resolution, rule, or formal action of any kind is invalid unless
adopted in an open meeting of the public body. A resolution, rule, or formal
action adopted in an open meeting that results from deliberations in a meeting
not open to the public is invalid unless the deliberations were for a purpose
specifically authorized in division (F) above and conducted at an executive
session held in compliance with this section. A resolution, rule, or formal
action adopted in an open meeting is invalid if the public body that adopted
the resolution, rule, or formal action violated division (E) above.
   (H)   (1)   (a)   Any person may bring an action to enforce this section. An
action under this division (H)(1) shall be brought within two years after the
date of the alleged violation or threatened violation.
         (b)   Upon proof of a violation or threatened violation of this
section in an action brought by any person, the Court of Common Pleas shall
issue an injunction to compel the members of the public body to comply with its
provisions.
      (2)   (a)   If the Court of Common Pleas issues an injunction pursuant to
division (H)(1) above, the court shall order the public body that it enjoins to
pay a civil forfeiture of $500 to the party that sought the injunction and
shall award to that party all court costs and, subject to reduction as
described in this division (H)(2), reasonable attorney’s fees. The court, in
its discretion, may reduce an award of attorney’s fees to the party that sought
the injunction or not award attorney’s fees to that party if the court
determines both of the following:
            1.   Based on the ordinary application of statutory law and case
law as it existed at the time of violation or threatened violation that was the
basis of the injunction, a well-informed public body reasonably would believe
that the public body was not violating or threatening to violate this section;
or
            2.   A well-informed public body reasonably would believe that the
conduct or threatened conduct that was the basis of the injunction would serve
the public policy that underlies the authority that is asserted as permitting
that conduct or threatened conduct.
         (b)   If the Court of Common Pleas does not issue an injunction
pursuant to division (H)(1) above and the court determines at that time that
the bringing of the action was frivolous conduct, as defined in R.C. § 2323.51
(A), the court shall award to the public body all court costs and reasonable

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 32.01 MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY; ELECTION; TERMS OF OFFICE.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (B) or (C) below, the
legislative power of each municipality shall be vested in, and exercised by, a
legislative authority, composed of six members, who shall be elected by the
electors of the municipality at large, for terms of four years.
   (B)   The legislative authority may adopt an ordinance or resolution that,
if approved by a majority of the electors voting on the issue, would reduce the
number of members of the legislative authority to five. A certified copy of the
ordinance or resolution shall be filed with the Board of Elections no later
than 4:00 p.m. of the ninetieth day before the day of the next election at
which members of the legislative authority are to be elected.
   (C)   The electors may propose a reduction in the number of members of the
legislative authority from six to five by initiative petition in accordance
with the procedure set forth in R.C. § 731.28.
   (D)   (1)   If a majority of the votes cast on the question proposed under
divisions (B) or (C) above is in the affirmative, the legislative authority
shall be composed of five members, who shall be elected at large, for terms of
four years.
      (2)   If members of the legislative authority have staggered terms of
office as required by this section, the decrease in number of members shall be
implemented as necessary over the next two municipal elections at which members
of the legislative authority would be elected.
      (3)   If the legislative authority has adopted an ordinance or resolution
to eliminate staggered terms of office under division (E) below, the five
members shall be elected as set forth in division (E)(2)(b) below.
(R.C. § 731.09)
   (E)   (1)   The legislative authority may, by the adoption of an ordinance
or resolution to eliminate staggered terms of office, determine that all
members of the legislative authority shall be elected at the same municipal
election as provided for in this section.
      (2)   At the regular municipal election occurring not less than 90 days
after the certification of the ordinance or resolution to the Board of
Elections eliminating staggered terms of office, the following apply.
         (a)   If there are six members of the legislative authority, the
number of members eligible for election at that regular municipal election
shall be elected to two-year non-staggered terms, and all members of the
legislative authority shall be elected to four-year non-staggered terms at all
following municipal elections.
         (b)   If there are five members of the legislative authority, a number
of members that is one less than the number of members that would otherwise be
eligible for election at that regular municipal election but for the first-time
implementation of the new membership of five, or, in the case of a village that
has previously reduced its number of members to five, then the number of
members eligible for election at that regular municipal election shall be
elected to two-year non-staggered terms, and all members shall be elected to
four-year non-staggered terms at all following municipal elections.
(R.C. § 731.091)
(2000 Code, § 32.01)
§ 32.02 PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE; EMPLOYEES.
   (A)   At the first meeting in January of each year, the legislative
authority shall immediately proceed to elect a President Pro Tem from its own
number, who shall serve until the first meeting in January next after his or
her election. The legislative authority may provide employees for the
municipality as it determines, and employees may be removed at any regular
meeting by a majority of the members elected to the legislative authority.
   (B)   When the Mayor is absent from the municipality, or is unable, for any
cause, to perform his or her duties, the President Pro Tem shall be the acting
Mayor, and shall have the same powers and perform the same duties as the Mayor.
(R.C. § 731.10) (2000 Code, § 32.02)
§ 32.03 VACANCY WHEN PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE BECOMES MAYOR.
   When the President Pro Tem of the legislative authority becomes the Mayor,
the vacancy thus created shall be filled as provided in §
32.06, and the legislative authority shall elect another President Pro Tem from
its own number, who shall have the same rights, powers, and duties as his or
her predecessor.
(R.C. § 731.11) (2000 Code, § 32.03)
§ 32.04 QUALIFICATIONS OF MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY.
   (A)   (1)   Each member of the legislative authority shall have resided in
the municipality for at least one year immediately preceding the member’s
election, and shall be an elector of the municipality.
      (2)   No member of the legislative authority shall hold any other public
office, be interested in any contract with the municipality, or hold employment
with the municipality, except that the member may be a notary public, a member
of the state militia, or a volunteer firefighter of the village; provided, that
such member shall not receive any compensation for his or her services as a
volunteer firefighter of the village in addition to his or her regular
compensation as a member of the legislative authority.
      (3)   Any member who ceases to possess any of these qualifications, or
who moves from the municipality, shall forfeit his or her office.
   (B)   The purpose of establishing a one-year residency requirement in this
section is to recognize that the municipality has a substantial and compelling
interest in encouraging qualified candidacies for election to the office of
member of the legislative authority by ensuring that a candidate for the office
has every opportunity to become knowledgeable with and concerned about the
problems and needs of the area the candidate seeks to represent. In enacting
this requirement, the municipality finds that the one-year period is reasonably
related to this purpose, while leaving unimpaired a person’s right to travel,
to vote, and to be a candidate for public office.

§ 32.05 COMPENSATION AND BONDS OF MUNICIPAL OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES.

their compensation for the ensuing term of office at a meeting held not later
than five days prior to the last day fixed by law for filing as a candidate for
such office. All bonds shall be made with sureties subject to the approval of
the Mayor. The compensation so fixed shall not be increased or diminished
during the term for which any officer is elected or appointed. This section
does not prohibit the payment of any increased costs of continuing to provide
the identical benefits provided to an officer at the commencement of his or her
term of office.

   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B) below, when the office of

filled by election by the legislative authority for the unexpired term. If the
legislative authority fails within 30 days to fill the vacancy, the Mayor shall
fill it by appointment, except that subject to division (B) below, when the
vacancy occurs because of the operation of R.C. § 733.25, or a substantially
similar municipal ordinance, the successor shall hold office only for the
period the President Pro Tem of the legislative authority holds the office of
Mayor.
   (B)   (1)   When a vacancy occurs in the office of a member of the
legislative authority of a village with a population of less than 2,000 because
of the operation of R.C. § 733.25, or a substantially similar municipal
ordinance, at the time the President Pro Tem becomes Mayor, the President Pro
Tem shall decide whether he or she wishes to serve the remainder of his or her
unexpired term as a member of the legislative authority when the Mayor’s
successor is elected and qualified in accordance with R.C. § 733.25, or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance.
      (2)   If the President Pro Tem decides to serve the remainder of his or
her unexpired term as a member of the legislative authority, the vacancy on the
legislative authority shall not be filled and the President Pro Tem shall
resume serving his or her unexpired term on the legislative authority as soon
as the Mayor’s successor is elected and qualified. If the President Pro Tem
decides not to resume serving the remainder of his or her unexpired term as a
member of the legislative authority as soon as the Mayor’s successor is elected
and qualified, then the vacancy in the office of the member of the legislative
authority shall be filled in accordance with this section.

§ 32.07 JUDGE OF ELECTION AND QUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS; QUORUM AND SPECIAL
MEETINGS.

of absent members in a manner and under penalties as are prescribed by
ordinance.
   (B)   The legislative authority shall provide rules for the manner of

personal protective equipment necessary to respond to that emergency, when any
expenditure, other than the compensation of persons employed in the
municipality, exceeds $50,000, such contracts shall be in writing and made to
the lowest and best bidder after advertising once a week for not less than two
consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation within the
municipality. The legislative authority may also cause notice to be inserted in
trade papers or other publications designated by it or to be distributed by
electronic means, including posting the notice on the legislative authority’s
internet web site. If the legislative authority posts the notice on its web
site, it may eliminate the second notice otherwise required to be published in
a newspaper of general circulation within the municipality; provided, that the
first notice published in such newspaper meets all of the following
requirements:
         (a)   It is published at least two weeks before the opening of bids.
         (b)   It includes a statement that the notice is posted on the
legislative authority’s internet web site.
         (c)   It includes the internet address of the legislative authority’s
internet web site.
         (d)   It includes instructions describing how the notice may be
accessed on the legislative authority’s internet web site.
      (2)   The bids shall be opened and shall be publicly read by the Clerk or
a person designated by the Clerk at the time, date, and place specified in the

openings may be extended to a late date by the legislative authority; provided,
that written or oral notice of the change shall be given to all persons who
have received or requested specifications no later than 96 hours prior to the
original time and date fixed for the opening. This division (A) does not apply
to the municipality if an Administrator has been appointed pursuant to the
provisions of R.C. § 735.271, or a substantially equivalent municipal

      (3)   As used in this division (A), PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT means

supervision involving not more than $50,000. When an expenditure, other than
the compensation of persons employed by the municipality, exceeds $50,000, the
expenditure shall first be authorized and directed by ordinance of the

read by the Administrator or a person designated by the Administrator at the
time, date, and place specified in the advertisement to bidders or
specifications. The time, date and place of bid openings may be extended to a
later date by the Administrator; provided, that written or oral notice of the
change shall be given to all persons who have received or requested
specifications no later than 96 hours prior to the original time and date fixed
for the opening. All contracts shall be executed in the name of the
municipality and signed on its behalf by the Administrator and the Clerk.
      (2)   The legislative authority may provide, by ordinance, for central
purchasing for all offices, departments, divisions, boards, and commissions of
the municipality, under the direction of the Administrator who shall make

§ 32.26 BIDS AND PROCEEDINGS.
   (A)   (1)   Each bid on any contract under §
32.25 shall contain the full name of every person interested in such bid. If
the bid is for the construction, demolition, alteration, repair, or
reconstruction of an improvement, it shall meet the requirements of R.C. §
153.54.
      (2)   If the bid is for any other contract authorized by §
32.25, it shall be accompanied by a sufficient bond or certified check,
cashier’s check, or money order on a solvent bank or savings and loan
association that, if the bid is accepted, a contract will be entered into and
the performance of it properly secured.
   (B)   (1)   If the bid for work embraces both labor and materials, it shall
be separately stated, with the price thereof.
      (2)   The legislative authority or Administrator, in the event an
Administrator has been appointed as provided by R.C. § 735.271, or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, may reject any and all bids.
      (3)   The contract shall be between the municipality and the bidder, and
the municipality shall pay such contract price in cash.
   (C)   (1)   When a bonus is offered for completion of a contract prior to a
specified date, the legislative authority or Administrator, in the event an
Administrator has been appointed as provided in R.C. § 735.271, or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, may exact a prorated penalty in like
sum for each day or delay beyond the specified date.
      (2)   When there is reason to believe there is collusion or combination
among bidders, the bids of those concerned therein shall be rejected.
(R.C. § 731.15) (2000 Code, § 32.26)
§ 32.27 ALTERATIONS OR MODIFICATIONS OF CONTRACT.
   When it becomes necessary in the opinion of the legislative authority or
Administrator, in the event an Administrator has been appointed as provided in
R.C. § 735.271, or a substantially similar municipal ordinance, in the
prosecution of any work under contract, to make alterations or modifications in
such contract, such alterations or modifications shall be made only by the
legislative authority by resolution or by the Administrator in writing. In the
event an Administrator had been appointed as provided in R.C. § 735.271, or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, but such resolution or written
modification shall be of no effect until the price to be paid for the work and
material, or both, under the altered or modified contract has been agreed upon
in writing and signed by the contractor, and by the Mayor or Administrator in
the event an Administrator has been appointed as provided in R.C. § 735.271, or
a substantially similar municipal ordinance, on behalf of the municipality. No
contractor shall recover anything for work or material because of any
alteration or modification unless such contract is made as provided in this
section, nor shall the contractor recover for such work or material, or either,
more than the agreed price. The law relating to requiring the bids and the
awarding of contracts for public buildings, so far as they apply, shall remain
in effect. A duplicate copy of each contract shall be filed in the office of
the Village Fiscal Officer.
(R.C. § 731.16) (2000 Code, § 32.27)
§ 32.28 CONTRACT RESTRICTIONS.
   The legislative authority shall not enter into any contract which is not to
go into full operation during the term for which all the members of such
legislative authority are elected.
(R.C. § 731.48) (2000 Code, § 32.28)
§ 32.29 AWARD TO LOWEST RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE BIDDER.
   (A)   (1)   If the municipality is required by law or by an ordinance or
resolution adopted under division (C) of this section to award a contract to
the lowest responsive and responsible bidder, a bidder on the contract shall be
considered responsive if the bidder’s proposal responds to bid specifications
in all material respects and contains no irregularities or deviations from the
specifications which would affect the amount of the bid or otherwise give the
bidder a competitive advantage. The factors that the municipality shall
consider in determining whether a bidder on the contract is responsible include
the experience of the bidder, the bidder’s financial condition, conduct and
performance on previous contracts, facilities, management skills, and ability
to execute the contract properly.
      (2)   For purposes of this division, the provision of a bid guaranty in
accordance with R.C. § 153.54(A)(1) and (B) issued by a surety licensed to do
business in this state is evidence of financial responsibility, but the
municipality may request additional financial information for review from an
apparent low bidder after it opens all submitted bids. The municipality shall
keep additional financial information it receives pursuant to a request under
this division confidential, except under proper order of a court. The
additional financial information is not a public record under R.C. § 149.43.
      (3)   An apparent low bidder found not to be responsive and responsible
shall be notified by the municipality of that finding and the reasons for it.
The notification shall be given in writing and either by certified mail or, if
the municipality has record of an internet identifier of record associated with
the bidder, by ordinary mail and by that internet identifier of record.
   (B)   Where the municipality has adopted an ordinance or resolution under
division (C) of this section and determines to award a contract to a bidder
other than the apparent low bidder or bidders for the construction,
reconstruction, improvement, enlargement, alteration, repair, painting or
decoration of a public improvement, it shall meet with the apparent low bidder
or bidders upon a filing of a timely written protest. The protest must be
received within five days of the notification required in division (A) of this
section. No final award shall be made until the municipality either affirms or
reverses its earlier determination. Notwithstanding any other provision of the
Ohio Revised Code, the procedure described in this division is not subject to
R.C. Chapter 119.
   (C)   The municipality may, by ordinance or resolution, adopt a policy of
requiring each competitively bid contract it awards to be awarded to the lowest
responsive and responsible bidder in accordance with this section.
   (D)   As used in this section, INTERNET IDENTIFIER OF RECORD means an
electronic mail address, or any other designation used for self- identification
or routing in internet communication or posting, provided for the purpose of
receiving communication.

Editor’s note:
The ability of a Mayor to preside over a Mayor’s Court was significantly
affected by DePiero v. City of Macedonia, 180 F.3d 770 (6th Cir. 1999), cert.
denied, 120 S. Ct. 844 (2000). The DePiero case essentially put all
municipalities on notice that a defendant’s due process rights may be violated
each time the Mayor presides over the Mayor’s Court. Such notice suggests that
a Mayor presiding over Mayor’s Court after June 23, 1999 (the date of issuance
of the opinion) could be personally liable to such a defendant for compensatory
and punitive damages. As a result of this case, many municipalities now have a
Magistrate preside over their Mayor’s Court pursuant to R.C. § 1905.05. Please
consult your Village Attorney if you have any questions regarding the impact of
this case.

   (A)   The Mayor and a Mayor’s Court Magistrate shall keep a docket. Neither
the Mayor nor a Mayor’s Court Magistrate shall retain or receive for his or her
own use any of the fines, forfeitures, fees, or costs he or she collects. A
Mayor’s Court Magistrate shall account for all such fines, forfeitures, fees,
and costs he or she collects and transfer them to the Mayor. The Mayor shall
account for and dispose of all such fines, forfeitures, fees, and costs he or
she collects, including all such fines, forfeitures, fees, and costs that are
transferred to him or her by a Mayor’s Court Magistrate, as provided in R.C. §
733.40.

   (C)   The Mayor shall keep an office, provided by the legislative authority,

§ 33.04 MAYOR’S COURT MAGISTRATE.
   (A)   A Mayor of a municipality that has a Mayor’s Court may appoint a
person as Mayor’s Court Magistrate to hear and determine prosecutions and
criminal cases in the Mayor’s Court that are within the jurisdiction of the
Mayor’s Court, as set forth in R.C. § 1905.01. No person shall be appointed as
a Mayor’s Court Magistrate unless the person has been admitted to the practice
of law in this state and, for a total of at least three years preceding his or
her appointment or the commencement of his or her service as magistrate, has
been engaged in the practice of law in this state or served as a judge of a
court of record in any jurisdiction in the United States, or both.
      (1)   A person appointed as a Mayor’s Court Magistrate under this
division (A)(1) is entitled to hear and determine prosecutions and criminal
cases in the Mayor’s Court that are within the jurisdiction of the Mayor’s
Court, as set forth in R.C. § 1905.01. If a Mayor is prohibited from hearing or
determining a prosecution or cause that charges a person with a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19 or a municipal OVI ordinance as defined in R.C. § 4511.181 due
to the operation of R.C. § 1905.03(C), or is prohibited from hearing or
determining any other prosecution or cause due to the operation of R.C. §
1905.031(C), the prohibition against the Mayor hearing or determining the
prosecution or causes does not affect and shall not be construed as affecting
the jurisdiction or authority of a person appointed as a Mayor’s Court
Magistrate under this division (A)(1) to hear and determine the prosecution or
cause in accordance with this section. In hearing and determining such
prosecutions and causes, the magistrate has the same powers, duties, and
authority as does a Mayor who conducts a Mayor’s Court to hear and determine
prosecutions and causes in general, including, but not limited to, the power
and authority to decide the prosecution or cause, enter judgement, and impose
sentence; the powers, duties, and authority granted to Mayors of Mayor’s Courts
by this chapter, in relation to the hearing and determination of prosecutions
and causes in Mayor’s Courts; and the powers, duties, and authority granted to
Mayors of Mayor’s Courts by any provisions of the Ohio Revised Code, in
relation to the hearing and determination of prosecutions and causes in Mayor’s
Courts. A judgement entered and a sentence imposed by a Mayor’s Court
Magistrate do not have to be reviewed or approved by the Mayor who appointed
the Magistrate, and have the same force and effect as if they had been entered
or imposed by the Mayor.
      (2)   A person appointed as a Mayor’s Court Magistrate under this
division (A)(2) is not entitled to hear or determine any prosecution or
criminal cause other than prosecutions and causes that are within the
jurisdiction of the Mayor’s Court, as set forth in R.C. § 1905.01.
      (3)   A municipality that a Mayor’s Court Magistrate serves shall pay the
compensation for the services of the Magistrate, which shall be either a fixed
annual salary set by the legislative authority or a fixed annual amount or fees
for services rendered set under a contract the Magistrate and the municipality
enter into.
   (B)   The appointment of a person as a Mayor’s Court Magistrate under
division (A) above does not preclude the Mayor that appointed the Magistrate,
subject to the limitation contained in R.C. § 1905.03 and the limitation
contained in R.C. § 1905.031, from also hearing and determining prosecutions
and criminal causes in the Mayor’s Court that are within the jurisdiction of
the Mayor’s Court, as set forth in R.C. § 1905.01.

   (B)   In addition, defendants may be required to pay any additional costs or
charges assessed by the state.

funds, and prepare an accounting of the funds.

§ 33.07 MAYOR’S COURT COMPUTER FUND.
   (A)   Pursuant to the general authority provided by R.C. § 5705.12, a Fund
is hereby created, called the Mayor’s Court Computer Fund, requiring that $3 of
every Mayor’s Court case be assessed said fee, that said fee be transferred and
deposited into the Mayor’s Court Computer Fund.

737.22.
   (B)   Fire Captains. Fire Captains shall alternate in the performance of
their duties as Fire Captains, and shall be charged with the responsibility of:
      (1)   The operation of fire equipment and apparatus;
      (2)   The prevention of fires by fire inspection;
      (3)   Directing firefighting and combating fires and saving lives;

      (7)   One of the Fire Captains may be designated by the Fire Chief as
instructor, and shall be charged with the additional responsibility of:
         (a)   Instructing and drilling of apprentice firefighters;
         (b)   Drilling of firefighters; and
         (c)   Keeping an accurate record of attendance of apprentices at all
instruction periods.
      (8)   Each Fire Captain shall assign firefighters under his or her
command to all duties at fires and lead the firefighters in saving lives and
property and in extinguishing fires. He or she shall also assign firefighters,
or apprentices under firefighters, in removing ashes from the premises or to
any other help that may be needed.
   (C)   Firefighters and apprentices. Volunteer firefighters who have
demonstrated their proficiency as firefighters through previous experience or
by examination, whether such examination be given by the instructor of the
state, or by the instructor of the village, and who have been previously
appointed by the Mayor are designated as firefighters. Volunteer firefighters
who have likewise been appointed by the Mayor, but have not demonstrated their
proficiency or passed the examination, are designated apprentices.
   (D)   Drills. In order to maintain a high degree of efficiency and
manipulative skill, all firefighters shall attend a period of drills not less
than once each calendar month to receive instructions and drill in the
practical and modern methods in the use and handling of all tools and
appliances used in the extinguishing of fires, and the saving of lives, and
shall be so instructed that they shall become thoroughly familiar with the
special duties of all positions, and may be called to demonstrate their skill
and knowledge in handling such tools, equipment, or apparatus. Times for drills
shall be specified by the instructor. Drill evolutions with the apparatus shall
be conducted in front of the fire station or at a conveniently near location
where it will be possible to train the fire force in speedy and safe operation
and driving, hydrant connecting, raising serial or portable ladders for the
purpose of rescuing persons, and elevating or advancing hose and equipment.
   (E)   Instruction of apprentice firefighters. All apprentices are required
to fulfill the necessary instruction requirements and show their proficiency by
examination. Instructions shall be given by the instructor and be based on a

traffic-control signs and signals shall be observed and obeyed on returning
from a fire or alarm.

on duty using their own cars in attending fires are to proceed in a cautious
manner, observe all traffic signs and signals and obey traffic officers who may
be on duty in the vicinity of the fire, and shall park their cars at a distance
from the fire, so as not to interfere with the operation of the apparatus or
the fighting of the fire itself and as to avoid blocking the steady flow of
traffic.
      (3)   Fire Captains and firefighters shall see that no persons other than
members of the Department or authorized officials ride on the fire apparatus
either going to or returning from a fire.
   (H)   Equipment. It is the duty of firefighters and apprentices to keep all
equipment in good condition and working order at all times and to use diligence
to see that no equipment is taken from the apparatus but that necessary for the
work at hand and shall prevent unauthorized persons from taking or handling
fire equipment. Before leaving the scene of a fire, a check shall be made to
see that all equipment is accounted for and in its proper place on the
apparatus.
   (I)   Fire hydrants. Firefighters and apprentices must note carefully the
location of hydrants within the village, study their operation, exercise great
care in opening and closing them, and see that all cups and covers are properly
adjusted after use.
   (J)   Badges. All firefighters shall be provided with a badge to be known as
the regulations badge of the Department, which shall be worn in a conspicuous
place during the time they are on duty. The badges shall not be loaned and
shall at all times remain village property.
   (K)   Suggestions and recommendations. Fire- fighters and apprentices are
urged to submit written recommendations for increasing the efficiency of the
Department. Recommendation of suitable appointees as firefighters or apprentice
firefighters shall be made to the Fire Chief.

not liable in damages in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to person or
property allegedly caused by any act or omission of the political subdivision
or an employee of the political subdivision in connection with a governmental
or proprietary function.
      (2)   The defenses and immunities conferred under this chapter and R.C.
Ch. 2744 apply in connection with all governmental and proprietary functions
performed by the political subdivision and its employees, whether performed on
behalf of the political subdivision or on behalf of another political
subdivision.
      (3)   Subject to statutory limitations upon their monetary jurisdiction,
the Courts of Common Pleas, the Municipal Courts, and the County Courts have
jurisdiction to hear and determine civil actions governed by or brought
pursuant to this chapter.
   (B)   Exceptions. Subject to §
36.03 and R.C. §§ 2744.03 and 2744.05, a political subdivision is liable in
damages in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to person or property
allegedly caused by an act or omission of the political subdivision or of any
of its employees in connection with a governmental or proprietary function, as
follows:
      (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (B), political
subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused
by the negligent operation of any motor vehicle by their employees when the
employees are engaged within the scope of their employment and authority.
         (b)   The following are full defenses to that liability:
            1.   A member of a municipal police department or any other police
agency was operating a motor vehicle while responding to an emergency call and
the operation of the vehicle did not constitute willful or wanton misconduct;
            2.   A member of a municipal fire department or any other
firefighting agency was operating a motor vehicle while engaged in duty at a
fire, proceeding toward a place where a fire is in progress or is believed to
be in progress, or answering any other emergency alarm and the operation of the
vehicle did not constitute willful or wanton misconduct; and
            3.   A member of an emergency medical service owned or operated by
a political subdivision was operating a motor vehicle while responding to or
completing a call for emergency medical care or treatment, the member was
holding a valid commercial driver’s license issued pursuant to R.C. Ch. 4506 or
a driver’s license issued pursuant to R.C. Ch. 4507, the operation of the
vehicle did not constitute willful or wanton misconduct, and the operation
complies with the precautions of R.C. § 4511.03.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. §§ 3314.07 and 3746.24,
political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or
property caused by the negligent performance of acts by their employees with
respect to proprietary functions of the political subdivisions.
      (3)   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. § 3746.24, political
subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused
by their negligent failure to keep public roads in repair and other negligent
failure to remove obstructions from public roads, except that it is a full
defense to that liability, when a bridge within a municipality is involved,
that the municipality does not have the responsibility for maintaining or
inspecting the bridge.
      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. § 3746.24, political
subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property that
is caused by the negligence of their employees and that occurs within or on the
grounds of, and is due to physical defects within or on the grounds of,
buildings that are used in connection with the performance of a governmental
function, including, but not limited to, office buildings and courthouses, but
not including jails, places of juvenile detention, workhouses, or any other
detention facility, as defined in R.C. § 2921.01.
      (5)   In addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B)(1)
through (B)(4) above, a political subdivision is liable for injury, death, or
loss to person or property when civil liability is expressly imposed upon the
political subdivision by a section of the Ohio Revised Code, including, but not
limited to, R.C. §§ 2743.02 and 5591.37. Civil liability shall not be construed
to exist under another section of this code or the Ohio Revised Code merely
because that section imposes a responsibility or mandatory duty upon a
political subdivision, because that section provides for a criminal penalty,
because of a general authorization in that section that a political subdivision
may sue and be sued, or because that section uses the term “shall” in a
provision pertaining to a political subdivision.
   (C)   An order that denies a political subdivision or an employee of a
political subdivision the benefit of an alleged immunity from liability as
provided in this chapter or any other provision of the law is a final order.
(R.C. § 2744.02) (2000 Code, § 36.02)
§ 36.03 DEFENSES AND IMMUNITIES.
   (A)   In a civil action brought against a political subdivision or an
employee of a political subdivision to recover damages for injury, death, or
loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or omission in
connection with a governmental or proprietary function, the following defenses
or immunities may be asserted to establish non-liability.
      (1)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the employee
involved was engaged in the performance of a judicial, quasi-judicial,
prosecutorial, legislative, or quasi-legislative function.
      (2)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the conduct
of the employee involved, other than negligent conduct, that gave rise to the
claim of liability was required by law or authorized by law, or if the conduct
of the employee involved that gave rise to the claim of liability was necessary
or essential to the exercise of powers of the political subdivision or
employee.
      (3)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the action or
failure to act by the employee involved that gave rise to the claim of
liability was within the discretion of the employee with respect to policy
making, planning, or enforcement powers by virtue of the duties and
responsibilities of the office or position of the employee.
      (4)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the action or
failure to act by the political subdivision or employee involved that gave rise
to the claim of liability, resulted in injury or death to a person who had been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to a criminal offense and who, at the time of
the injury or death, was serving any portion of his or her sentence by
performing community service work for or in the political subdivision whether
pursuant to R.C. § 2951.02 or otherwise, or resulted in injury or death to a
child who was found to be a delinquent child and who, at the time of the injury
or death, was performing community service or community work for or in a
political subdivision in accordance with the order of a juvenile court entered
pursuant to R.C. § 2152.19 or 2152.20, and if, at the time of that person’s or
child’s injury or death, the person or child was covered for purposes of R.C.
Ch. 4123 in connection with the community service or community work for or in
the political subdivision.
      (5)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the injury,
death, or loss to person or property resulted from the exercise of judgment or
discretion in determining whether to acquire, or how to use, equipment,
supplies, materials, personnel, facilities, and other resources, unless the
judgment or discretion was exercised with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or
in a wanton or reckless manner.
      (6)   In addition to any immunity or defense referred to in divisions (A)
(7) below and in circumstances not covered by that division or R.C. §§ 3314.07
and 3746.24, the employee is immune from liability unless one of the following
applies:
         (a)   His or her acts or omissions were manifestly outside the scope
of his or her employment or official responsibilities;
         (b)   His or her acts or omissions were with malicious purpose, in bad
faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner; or
         (c)   Civil liability is expressly imposed upon the employee by a
section of the Ohio Revised Code. Civil liability shall not be construed to
exist under another section of the Ohio Revised Code merely because that
section imposes a responsibility or mandatory duty upon an employee, because
that section provides for a criminal penalty, because of a general
authorization in that section that an employee may sue and be sued, or because
the section uses the term “shall” in a provision pertaining to an employee.
      (7)   The political subdivision, and an employee who is the Chief Legal
Officer of a political subdivision, an assistant of any such person, or a judge
of a court of this state, is entitled to any defense or immunity available at
common law or established by the Ohio Revised Code.
   (B)   Any immunity or defense conferred upon, or referred to in connection
with, an employee by divisions (A)(6) or (A)(7) above does not affect or limit
any liability of a political subdivision for an act or omission of the employee
as provided in §
36.02.
(R.C. § 2744.03) (2000 Code, § 36.03)
§ 36.04 LIMITATION OF ACTIONS.
   (A)   An action against a political subdivision to recover damages for
injury, death, or loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or
omission in connection with a governmental or proprietary function, whether
brought as an original action, cross- claim, counterclaim, third-party claim,
or claim for subrogation, shall be brought within two years after the cause of
action accrues, or within any applicable shorter period of time for bringing
the action provided by the Ohio Revised Code. The period of limitation
contained in this division (A) shall be tolled pursuant to R.C. § 2305.16. This
section applies to actions brought against political subdivisions by all
persons, governmental entities, and the state.
   (B)   In the complaint filed in a civil action against a political
subdivision or an employee of a political subdivision to recover damages for
injury, death, or loss to person or property allegedly caused by an act or
omission in connection with a governmental or proprietary function, whether
filed in an original action, cross-claim, counterclaim, third-party claim, or
claim for subrogation, the complainant shall include a demand for a judgment
for the damages that the judge in a non-jury trial or the jury in a jury trial
finds that the complainant is entitled to be awarded, but shall not specify in
that demand any monetary amount for damages sought.
(R.C. § 2744.04) (2000 Code, § 36.04)
§ 36.05 DAMAGES.
   (A)   Notwithstanding any other provision of the Ohio Revised Code or rules
of a court to the contrary, in an action against a political subdivision to
recover damages for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by an
act or omission in connection with a governmental or proprietary function,
punitive or exemplary damages shall not be awarded.
   (B)   (1)   If a claimant receives or is entitled to receive benefits for
injuries or loss allegedly incurred from a policy or policies of insurance or
any other source, the benefits shall be disclosed to the court, and the amount
of the benefits shall be deducted from any award against a political
subdivision recovered by the claimant. No insurer or other person is entitled
to bring an action under a subrogation provision in an insurance or other
contract against a political subdivision with respect to those benefits. The
amount of the benefits shall be deducted from an award against a political
subdivision under this division (B)(1) regardless of whether the claimant may
be under an obligation to pay back the benefits upon recovery, in whole or in
part, for the claim. A claimant whose benefits have been deducted from an award
under this division (B)(1) is not considered fully compensated and shall not be
required to reimburse a subrogated claim for benefits deducted from an award
pursuant to this division (B)(1).
      (2)   Nothing in division (B)(1) above shall be construed to do either of
the following:
         (a)   Limit the rights of a beneficiary under a life insurance policy
or the rights of sureties under fidelity or surety bonds; or
         (b)   Prohibit the Department of Medicaid from recovering from the
political subdivision, pursuant to R.C. § 5160.37, the cost of medical
assistance under a medical assistance program.
   (C)   (1)   There shall not be any limitation on compensatory damages that
represent the actual loss of the person who is awarded the damages; however,
except in wrongful death actions brought pursuant to R.C. Ch. 2125, damages
that arise from the same cause of action, transaction, or occurrence, or series
of transactions or occurrences and that do not represent the actual loss of the
person who is awarded the damages shall not exceed $250,000 in favor of any one
person. The limitation on damages that do not represent the actual loss of the
person who is awarded the damages provided in this section does not apply to
court costs that are awarded to a plaintiff, or to interest on a judgment
rendered in favor of a plaintiff, in an action against a political subdivision.
      (2)   (a)   As used in this section, THE ACTUAL LOSS OF THE PERSON WHO IS
AWARDED THE DAMAGES includes all of the following:
            1.   All wages, salaries, or other compensation lost by the person
injured as a result of the injury, including wages, salaries, or other
compensation lost as of the date of a judgment and future expected lost
earnings of the person injured;

behalf of the person injured for medical care or treatment, for rehabilitation
services, or for other care, treatment, services, products, or accommodations
that were necessary because of the injury;
            3.   All expenditures to be incurred in the future, as determined
by the court, by the person injured or another person on behalf of the person
injured for medical care or treatment, for rehabilitation services, or for
other care, treatment, service, products, or accommodations that will be
necessary because of the injury;
            4.   All expenditures of a person whose property was injured or
destroyed or of another person on behalf of the person whose property was

property was injured or destroyed or of another person on behalf of the person
injured or of the person whose property was injured or destroyed in relation to
the actual preparation or presentation of the claim involved; and
            6.   Any other expenditures of the person injured or of the person
whose property was injured or destroyed or of another person on behalf of the
person injured or of the person whose property was injured or destroyed that
the court determines represent an actual loss experienced because of the
personal or property injury or property loss.
         (b)   As used in this section, THE ACTUAL LOSS OF THE PERSON WHO IS
AWARDED THE DAMAGES does not include any fees paid or owed to an attorney for
any services rendered in relation to a personal or property injury or property
loss, and does not include any damages awarded for pain and suffering, for the
loss of society, consortium, companionship, care, assistance, attention,
protection, advice, guidance, counsel, instruction, training, or education of
the person injured, for mental anguish, or for any other intangible loss.
(R.C. § 2744.05) (2000 Code, § 36.05)
§ 36.06 SATISFACTION OF JUDGMENTS.
   (A)   Real or personal property, and monies, accounts, deposits, or

political subdivision in a civil action to recover damages for injury, death,
or loss to person or property caused by an act or omission of the political
subdivision or any of its employees in connection with a governmental or
proprietary function. Those judgments shall be paid from funds of the political
subdivisions that have been appropriated for that purpose, but, if sufficient
funds are not currently appropriated for the payment of judgments, the fiscal
officer of a political subdivision shall certify the amount of any unpaid
judgments to the taxing authority of the political subdivision for inclusion in
the next succeeding budget and annual appropriation measure and payment in the
next succeeding fiscal year as provided by R.C. § 5705.08, unless any judgment
of that nature is to be paid from the proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to R.C.
§ 133.14 or pursuant to annual installments authorized by divisions (B) or (C)
below.
   (B)   (1)   (a)   As used in this section, THE ACTUAL LOSS OF THE PERSON WHO
IS AWARDED THE DAMAGES includes all of the following:
            1.   All wages, salaries, or other compensation lost by the person
injured as a result of the injury, as of the date of judgment;
            2.   All expenditures of the person injured or of another person on
behalf of the person injured for medical care or treatment, for rehabilitation
services, or for other care, treatment, services, products, or accommodations
that were necessary because of the injury;
            3.   All expenditures of a person whose property was injured or
destroyed or of another person on behalf of the person whose property was

            4.   All expenditures of the person injured or whose property was
injured or destroyed or of another person on behalf of the person injured whose
property was injured or destroyed in relation to the actual preparation or
presentation of the claim involved; and
            5.   Any other expenditure of the person injured or whose property
was injured or destroyed or of another person on behalf of the person injured
or of the person whose property was injured or destroyed that the court
determines represent an actual loss experienced because of the personal or
property injury or property loss.
         (b)   As used in this section, THE ACTUAL LOSS OF THE PERSON WHO IS
AWARDED THE DAMAGES does not include any of the following:
            1.   Wages, salaries, or other compensation lost by the person
injured as a result of the injury that are future expected earnings of that
person;
            2.   Expenditures to be incurred in the future, as determined by
the court, by the person injured or by another person on behalf of the person
injured for medical care or treatment, for rehabilitation services, or for
other care, treatment, services, products, or accommodations that will be
necessary because of the injury;
            3.   Any fees paid or owed to an attorney for any services rendered
in relation to a personal or property injury or property loss; or
            4.   Any damages awarded for pain and suffering, for the loss of
society, consortium, companionship, care, assistance, attention, protection,
advice, guidance, counsel, instruction, training, or education of the person
injured, for mental anguish, or for any other intangible loss.
      (2)   (a)   Except as specifically provided to the contrary in this
section, a court that renders a judgment against a political subdivision as
described in division (A) above and that is not in favor of the state may
authorize the political subdivision, upon the motion of the political
subdivision, to pay the judgment or a specified portion of the judgment in
annual installments over a period not to exceed ten years, subject to the
payment of interest at the rate specified in R.C. § 1343.03(A). A court shall
not authorize the payment in installments under this division (B) of any
portion of a judgment or entire judgment that represents the actual loss of the
person who is awarded the damages.
         (b)   Additionally, a court shall not authorize the payment in
installments under this division (B) of any portion of a judgment or entire
judgment that does not represent the actual loss of the person who is awarded
the damages unless the court, after balancing the interests of the political
subdivision and of the person in whose favor the judgment was rendered,
determines that installment payments would be appropriate under the
circumstances and would not be unjust to the person in whose favor the judgment
was rendered. If a court makes that determination, it shall fix the amount of
the installment payments in a manner that achieves for the person in whose
favor the judgment was rendered the same economic result over the period as
that person would have received if the judgment or portion of the judgment
subject to the installment payments had been paid in a lump sum payment.
   (C)   At the option of a political subdivision, a judgment as described in
division (A) above and that is rendered in favor of the state may be paid in
equal annual installments over a period not to exceed ten years, without the
payment of interest.
(R.C. § 2744.06) (2000 Code, § 36.06)
§ 36.07 DEFENDING AND INDEMNIFYING EMPLOYEES.
   (A)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (A)(2) of this section,

state or federal court, in any civil action or proceeding which contains an
allegation for damages for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused
by an act or omission of the employee in connection with a governmental or
proprietary function. Amounts expended by a political subdivision in the
defense of its employees shall be from funds appropriated for this purpose or
from proceeds of insurance.
      (2)   A political subdivision does not have the duty to provide for the
defense of an employee under division (A)(1) of this section if any of the
following apply:
         (a)   The act or omission occurred while the employee was not acting
in good faith.
         (b)   The act or omission occurred while the employee was acting
manifestly outside the scope of the employee’s employment or official
responsibilities.
         (c)   The civil action or proceeding is commenced by or on behalf of a
political subdivision.
         (d)   The employee is an employee of a regional council of governments

            1.   The employee is not also an employee of a political
subdivision that is a member of the council.
            2.   The act or omission, if proven, would constitute a violation
of R.C. Chapter 102 or R.C. Chapter 2921.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B)(2) of this section,
a political subdivision shall indemnify and hold harmless an employee in the
amount of any judgment, other than a judgment for punitive or exemplary
damages, that is obtained against the employee in a state or federal court or
as a result of a law of a foreign jurisdiction and that is for damages for
injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by an act or omission in
connection with a governmental or proprietary function.
      (2)   A political subdivision is not required to indemnify and hold

following apply:
         (a)   At the time of the act or omission, the employee was not acting
in good faith.
         (b)   At the time of the act or omission, the employee was not acting

            1.   The employee is not also an employee of a political
subdivision that is a member of the council.
            2.   The act or omission constitutes a violation of R.C. Chapter
102 or R.C. Chapter 2921.
   (C)   (1)   A political subdivision may enter into a consent judgment or
settlement and may secure releases from liability for itself or an employee,
with respect to any claim for injury, death, or loss to person or property
caused by an act or omission in connection with a governmental or proprietary
function.
      (2)   No action or appeal of any kind shall be brought by any person,
including any employee or a taxpayer, with respect to the decision of a
political subdivision pursuant to division (C)(1) of this section whether to
enter into a consent judgment or settlement or to secure releases, or
concerning the amount and circumstances of a consent judgment or settlement.
Amounts expended for any settlement shall be from funds appropriated for this
purpose.
   (D)   (1)   If a political subdivision refuses to provide an employee with a
defense in a civil action or proceeding as described in division (A) of this
section, upon the motion of the political subdivision, the court shall conduct
a hearing regarding the political subdivision’s duty to defend the employee in
that civil action. The political subdivision shall file the motion within 30
days of the close of discovery in the action. After the motion is filed, the
employee shall have not less than 30 days to respond to the motion.
      (2)   At the request of the political subdivision or the employee, the
court shall order the motion to be heard at an oral hearing. At the hearing on
the motion, the court shall consider all evidence and arguments submitted by
the parties. The court shall determine whether the political subdivision has

to defend the employee under division (A) of this section, the court shall
order the political subdivision to defend the employee in the action.
(R.C. § 2744.07) (2000 Code, § 36.07)
§ 36.08 LIABILITY INSURANCE.
   (A)   (1)   A political subdivision may use public funds to secure insurance
with respect to its and its employees’ potential liability in damages in civil
actions for injury, death, or loss to persons or property allegedly caused by
an act or omission of the political subdivision or any of its employees in
connection with a governmental or proprietary function. The insurance may be at
the limits, for the circumstances, and subject to the terms and conditions,
that are determined by the political subdivision in its discretion. The
insurance may be for the period of time that is set forth in specifications for
competitive bids or, when competitive bidding is not required, for the period
of time that is mutually agreed upon by the political subdivision and insurance
company. The period of time does not have to be, but can be, limited to the
fiscal cycle under which the political subdivision is funded and operated.
      (2)   (a)   Regardless of whether a political subdivision procures a
policy of liability insurance pursuant to division (A)(1) above or otherwise,
the political subdivision may establish and maintain a self- insurance program
relative to its and its employees’ potential liability in damages in civil
actions for injury, death, or loss to persons or property allegedly caused by
an act or omission of the political subdivision or any of its employees in
connection with a governmental or proprietary function. The political
subdivision may reserve such funds as it deems appropriate in a special fund
that may be established pursuant to an ordinance or resolution of the political
subdivision and not subject to R.C. § 5705.12. The political subdivision may
allocate the costs of insurance of a self-insurance program, or both, among the
funds or accounts in the subdivision’s treasury on the basis of relative
exposure and loss experience. The political subdivision may require any
deductibles under an insurance or self-insurance program, or both, to be paid
from funds or accounts in the subdivision’s treasury from which a loss was
directly attributable. If it so chooses, the political subdivision may contract
with any person, other political subdivision, or regional council of
governments for purposes of the administration of the program.
         (b)   Political subdivisions that have established self-insurance
programs relative to their and their employees’ potential liability as
described in division (A)(2)(a) above may mutually agree that their self-
insurance programs will be jointly administered in a specific manner.
   (B)   The purchase of liability insurance, or the establishment and
maintenance of a self-insurance program, by a political subdivision does not
constitute a waiver of any immunity or defense of the political subdivision or
its employees, except that the political subdivision may specifically waive any
immunity or defense to which it or its employees may be entitled if a provision
to that effect is specifically included in the policy of insurance or in a
written plan of operation of the self-insurance program, or if any, the
legislative enactment of the political subdivision authorizing the purchase of
the insurance or the establishment and maintenance of the self-insurance
program. Such a specific waiver shall be only to the extent of the insurance or
self-insurance program coverage.
   (C)   The authorizations for political subdivisions to secure insurance and
to establish and maintain self- insurance programs in this section are in
addition to any other authority to secure insurance or to establish and
maintain self-insurance programs that is granted pursuant to the Ohio Revised
Code or the Ohio Constitution, and they are not in derogation of any other
authorization.
(R.C. § 2744.08)
   (D)   If a political subdivision, pursuant to division (A)(2)(a) above or a
joint self-insurance pool pursuant to R.C. § 2744.081, has allocated costs to,
or required the payment of deductibles from, funds or accounts in the
subdivision’s treasury, the subdivisions’s fiscal officer, pursuant to
ordinance or resolution of the legislative authority, shall transfer amounts
equal to those costs or deductibles from the funds or accounts of the
subdivision’s General Fund if both of the following occur:
      (1)   The subdivision requests payment from the employee responsible for
the funds or accounts for those costs or deductibles; and
      (2)   The employee receiving the request fails to remit payment within 45
days after the date of receipt of the request.
   (E)   The provisions of R.C. §§ 5705.14, 5705.15, and 5705.16 do not apply
to transfers made pursuant to division (D) above.

following:
   (A)   Civil actions that seek to recover damages from a political
subdivision or any of its employees for contractual liability;

permittee has made the back fill and installed the proper base;
      (3)   The work may be done either completely as in this division (A) or
as to paving surface only, as in division (B) below, by a village contractor or
County Engineer duly authorized by a contract with the village; or
      (4)   The entire work of restoration may be done by the permittee.
   (B)   In all cases, the entire work shall be carried out under the direction
of and to the satisfaction of the Mayor and Building Commissioner, and in

describing the manner in which restoration work shall be done. The rules and
regulations shall contain a schedule of prices to be charged for various size
openings in various kinds of paving, due regard being had to the kind of
service to be rendered by the village and prevailing prices in connection with
the restoration work. The Mayor shall recommend changes in the rules,
regulations, and specifications and revisions to the schedule of prices

Officer shall, under the direction of the Mayor, cause notices to be sent to
all abutting property owners requiring them to install any needed water or
sewer service branches.
   (B)   Notice shall also be sent to all public utility corporations and
village departments to install all necessary mains, conduits, service branches,
and structures. Property owners, public utility corporations, and water works
shall be allowed the necessary and legal time required for the aforesaid
installations before the new pavement is laid. Thereafter, during the period of
three years from the final completion and acceptance of the new pavement, no
permit for making an opening in such pavement shall be issued except by express
authority in each case from the Mayor, and he or she shall exercise this
special authority only for reasons of public necessity or of undue private
hardship where the necessity for the opening arises from causes over which the
applicant has no control. Lack of foresight in not installing service
connection prior to the laying of a new pavement shall not be considered as
adequate reason for abrogation of the three-year restriction. In all cases
where a street opening permit shall be issued during the restriction period, an
additional suitable charge in excess of the schedule rate shall be imposed on
the basis of 2% per month of the unelapsed period, in no event less than 10%.

by deposits based on the estimated cost of restoring the street openings. In
cases where the edge of the excavation is more than three feet from the curb
line, the Building Commissioner shall, at the first indication of any
settlement in the street surface or curbing, require the builder to obtain a
street opening permit from the Department and shall have the right to suspend
or cancel the building permit until the street opening permit has been issued.

any street because of building operations and that no permit deposit or other
provision has been made for the street restoration, the expense of the
necessary restoration shall be charged to the property owner as though a permit
had been issued, and, where necessary, suit shall be brought by the Village
Solicitor to collect the amount of the same, if not paid.

or otherwise improving the same, or desires to construct a sewer through
private property to connect with a public sewer, he or she shall deposit the
estimated cost of inspection and supervision and submit the plans and
specifications under which the work is to be executed. The Village Engineer
shall certify that all requirements of the village with respect thereto have
been complied with or issue a statement as to conditions and modifications
required. Upon certification by the Village Engineer and upon application by

§ 55.09 SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION, REPLACEMENT, REPAIR, AND SUPERVISION.
   (A)   Construction and replacement of public sidewalks. All sidewalks
constructed, repaired, and/or replaced shall be constructed of portland cement
concrete and shall be poured-in-place at the site.
   (B)   Repairs of existing sidewalks. Any existing sidewalks may be repaired
with the same type of material; provided, that more than 90% of the entire
front footage of the premises of one owner is in a condition acceptable to the
Building Commissioner, otherwise it shall be replaced by a portland cement
sidewalk.
   (C)   Sidewalk specifications. Portland cement concrete walks and portland
cement concrete handicap ramps shall be five inches thick and of one course
construction, being laid directly on the prepared subgrade. They shall be
composed of Class “C” concrete containing 6+ or - 2% of entrained air in
accordance with Item 499 of the Construction and Material Specifications, State
Department of Transportation. The width and grade of all new and replaced shall
be as provided in §
55.02.
      (1)   Excavation for the walk shall be made to a depth of five inches
below the proposed finished grade, and to a width of three inches more on each
side than the width of the proposed walk. All tree roots exposed by excavation
shall be cut off at least three inches outside the lines of the new walk and
three inches below the subgrade. After having been evenly fine graded, the
subgrade shall be thoroughly compacted with a five-ton roller. Where the use of
a roller is impracticable, the subgrade shall be compacted by heavy tamping. If
springs are encountered, drains shall be laid as directed by the Engineer.
      (2)   Forms may be either steel or sound two- inch plank and shall be
straight, true and clean. The forms shall be set true to line and grade and
firmly staked down. Where curved walks are required, thin strips or forms that
will produce a smooth, regular curve shall be used. The alignment, elevation,
and slope of all walks shall be subject to special directions from the
Engineer. Full width walk at its junction with the curb shall usually be one-
fourth inch above the curbing. Also, the slope of full width walk shall be
five-sixteenths inch per foot up from the curb to the building line. Any
variation from these details will be shown on the plans or as directed by the
Engineer.
      (3)   Concrete for portland cement concrete walks shall be of plastic
consistence and shall be placed on the prepared subgrade in one operation. It
shall be struck off and truly straightened, and neatly hand floated until all
coarse aggregate is entirely covered. Before the concrete sets, the surface of
the walk shall be cut into blocks with a jointer, and the edges tooled until
they are firm and smooth. The blocks shall be cut to straight lines generally
rectangular, measuring usually not less than two or more than five feet on the
side. The design of the blocking shall be subject to special direction of the
Engineer. After the walk has been blocked out, the concrete shall be carefully
floated to a smooth and uniform surface. The margin of each block shall then be
tooled with the edger or jointer to a smooth, dense finish. These final edger
or jointer marks shall not be floated out.
      (4)   Around street and stop sign posts, the walk shall be blocked out in
one-foot squares. Around utility poles, the walk shall be blocked out in two-
foot squares.
      (5)   Expansion joints shall be provided at such intervals, not exceeding
30 feet, as the Engineer may direct. Joints shall be made of preformed
material, one-half inch thick and five inches wide, meeting the requirements of
Item 451 of the Construction and Material Specifications.
      (6)   The same type of joint shall be constructed at all joints between
the new walk and the curb, between the new walk and all new entrance walks and
driveways, and between the curb and all new entrance walks. Also, the same kind
of material one-fourth inch thick and five inches wide shall be installed
around all poles, fire hydrants, cellar holes, inlets, and the like. Where
cement walks are laid along steel faced curbs, expansion joints shall be
installed in conformity with the joints in the curbs. The breaking or
displacement of curbs or the buckling of walks due to lack of proper expansion
joints shall be made good by the contractor at his or her own expense.
      (7)   It is understood that all work must connect with the adjoining work
in a reasonable manner, to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
      (8)   Portland cement concrete walks shall be cured in strict accordance
with the provisions of § 451.10, Construction and Material Specifications,
State of Ohio Department of Transportation, as follows.
      (9)   Immediately after the finishing operations have been completed and
after the free water has disappeared, all exposed surface of the concrete shall
be sealed by spraying thereon a uniform application of curing membrane in such
a manner as to provide a continuous uniform film without marring the surface of
the concrete. The material shall be applied with an approved self-propelled
mechanical sprayer. Wind protection to the spray fog shall be provided by an
adequate shield. A minimum of one gallon of material shall be used for each 150
square feet of surface treated. Curing material shall be thoroughly agitated
immediately prior to use.
         (a)   On small or irregular areas which are inaccessible to the
mechanical spray machine, the curing material may be applied by a hand spray.
         (b)   As soon as the forms have been removed, any honeycomb areas
shall be immediately corrected and the edges of the pavement coated with the
curing material. Any areas of pavement film that may have been damaged during
the sawing shall be resprayed during this operation.
         (c)   Concrete placed after October 31 and prior to April 1 shall be
cured by used of resin base curing compounds, or burlap mats, water-proof
paper, polyethylene sheeting or water-proofing curing blankets. Curing shall be
applied as soon after the finishing operations as possible without marring the
surface of the concrete. The entire surface of the top and sides of the newly
placed concrete shall be covered and maintained covered for seven days, unless
specimen beams have attained a modules of rupture of 600 psi.
         (d)   The contractor shall be responsible for protecting the concrete
from freezing until beams attain a strength of 600 psi.
         (e)   The above requirements for curing are minimum requirements only.
Any concrete showing injury or damage due to inadequate curing shall be
repaired or replaced by the contractor at no additional cost.
      (10)   (a)   When the temperature is below 40°F, or predicted to go below
36°F, in the next 24 hours, or predicted to go below 32°F in the next 72 hours,
no concrete pavement shall be poured without the express permission of the
Engineer. Permission so granted shall be for the day and location in question
only and must again be requested on subsequent days when the temperatures are
as above.
         (b)   When such permission is granted, the following requirements must
be met.
            1.   No concrete shall be poured until adequate covering material
is on the side and a sufficient number of workers are present to expedite the
finishing and covering to keep both as close behind spread as is practicable.
            2.   All forms shall be cleaned of all frost. In no case shall
concrete be poured on frozen ground or subgrade on which there is frost.
      (11)   The contractor shall, after removing the strips used in screening
the walk, fill the spaces left by the removal with fine earth well compacted.
When there is a lawn space between curb and walk, this shall also be neatly
dressed to conform to grade of walk and curb. The earth shall also be well
banked against the property line side of the walk.
   (D)   Concrete driveways across public sidewalks.
      (1)   The concrete for driveways shall be Class “C”. The driveways shall
be seven inches thick and of the length and width ordered by the Engineer. The
driveways shall be constructed in strict accordance with the standard drawings
on file in the Col. Donald L. Shanks Municipal Building which show the details
of construction along the various types of curbs.
      (2)   Excavation shall be made and the subgrade shall be evenly fine
graded and solidly compacted with a five-ton roller. Where the use of a roller
is impractical, the subgrade shall be compacted by heavy tamping. Forms may be
of either steel or sound two-inch plank, and they shall be straight, true and
clean. The forms shall be set true to line and grade firmly staked down and
well braced. Concrete shall be placed in accordance with the requirements for
sidewalks and shall be given an even and uniform float finish. Preformed
expansion joint filler one-half inch thick shall be placed on both sides
between the driveway and walk and the driveway and the curb. If the driveway is
over 30 feet long, the joint filler along the curb shall be one inch thick.
      (3)   Concrete driveways shall be cut into blocks, the same as a walk and
shall be cured in strict accordance with the requirements for sidewalks.

condemning sidewalks.
      (1)   Any block having a crack or cracks in it more than five-eighths of
an inch wide;
      (2)   Adjoining blocks or portions thereof whose edges differ vertically
by more than five- eighths of an inch;
      (3)   Blocks that have holes in them five- eighths of an inch or more in
diameter or are cracked and broken so that pieces are missing or loose;
      (4)   Blocks having depressions, reverse cross-slope, (sloping away from
the street) or below curb grade so as to impound mud or water;
      (5)   Blocks having a cross-slope in excess of three-fourths of an inch
vertical per one foot horizontal;
      (6)   Blocks that cause an abrupt change in the longitudinal grade of the
sidewalk.;

it very rough with the coarse aggregate protruding;
      (8)   Sidewalk material placed without prior approval through the
granting of a revokable minor street privilege;
      (9)   Sod area between the sidewalk and street that protrudes above the
sidewalk and impounds water or causes it to drain along the sidewalk, in such
cases the condition should be corrected by lowering the sod. In cases where the
sod area on either side of the sidewalk is below the grade of the sidewalk, a
fill should be made and the area either sodded or seeded;
      (10)   Stumps, stones, private sign posts, or any other unauthorized
obstruction in the sidewalk space;
      (11)   Trees, bushes, or shrubs that overhang the sidewalk. Tree limbs
should be trimmed to at least eight feet above the sidewalk after obtaining
permit from the Maintenance Superintendent. Bushes or shrubs should be trimmed
so as not to overhang the sidewalk even after a rain; or
      (12)   Water stop-boxes, gas stop-boxes, and the like, that are not to
proper grade.
   (B)   Criteria for condemning driveways. The following are criteria for
condemning driveways.
      (1)   Any driveway having a crack or cracks in it more than five-eighths
of an inch wide;
      (2)   Driveways that differ vertically by more than five-eighths of an
inch either above or below the sidewalk;
      (3)   Driveways that are cracked or broken or have holes larger than
five-eighths of an inch in diameter;
      (4)   Driveway entrances within the street right-of-way constructed of
materials other than concrete or bituminous concrete on an unimproved street
(streets not having curbs) that have been placed without prior approval through
the granting of a revokable minor street privilege;
      (5)   Driveways that are dipped across the sidewalk so as to create an
abrupt change of grade. This condition normally exists where the driveway at
street edge of the sidewalk has been held several inches below the grade of the
sidewalk and the transition from the driveway to sidewalk grade is accomplished
in a very short distance; or
      (6)   Curb to be restored only if sidewalk abuts curb or if abandoned or
unimproved driveway is being used illegally.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
§ 56.01 BACKGROUND.
   (A)   Ohio House Bill 478 ("HB 478") modifies a previously adopted law
regarding wireless service and the placement of small cell facilities in city
rights-of-way. It was passed on April 11, 2018, signed by the governor on May
2, 2018 and is effective as of August 1, 2018. The law is intended to promote
the rapid deployment of small cell facility infrastructure within the right-of-
way by ensuring that municipalities grant or deny consent to install, operate,
modify, or replace wireless facilities in a timely manner. The law recognizes
the authority of a municipality to manage access to, and occupancy of, rights-
of-ways to the extent necessary with regard to matters of local concern. This
includes the protection of the integrity of historic areas and ensures that the
use of the rights-of-way in such districts is technologically and aesthetically
appropriate.
   (B)   Chapter 15 of the Village of Mariemont Ordinances has been written to
account for the provisions of HB 478 for the regulation of small cell
facilities and wireless support structures within city rights-of-way.
(Ord. O-15-20, passed 6-8-2020)
§ 56.02 PURPOSE.
   (A)   In addition to the requirements of Title 15, these design guidelines
for wireless communications facilities ("design guidelines") provide guidance
to wireless communications carriers on the aesthetic requirements and
specifications that all small cell facilities and wireless support structures
must meet prior to installation in the Village of Mariemont right-of-way.
   (B)   The objective of the design guidelines is to strike a balance between
preserving the character of the village, architecturally and visually, through
careful design, siting, landscaping and camouflaging techniques to blend these
facilities into their environment, while enhancing the ability of wireless
communications carriers to deploy small cell facilities and wireless support
structures in the village quickly, effectively, and efficiently so that
residents, businesses, and visitors benefit from wireless service availability.
   (C)   The intent of the design guidelines is also to protect the public
health, safety and general welfare and to provide wireless communications
service to the community in a safe, effective and efficient manner.
   (D)   The design guidelines provide for the managed development of wireless
communications and are intended to allow sufficient flexibility to respond to
and integrate changes in safety regulations, future advances in small cell
facilities technology as well as innovations that improve the ability for these
facilities to integrate into the surrounding environment. Due to the rapid
advances in wireless technology, the design guidelines will be evaluated
periodically to ensure that the provisions respond and adapt accordingly to
these evolving technologies.
   (E)   These guidelines apply to requests to locate small cell facilities and
wireless support structures in the right-of-way and are administered by the
village Building Department. That office can be reached at 513-271-3315.
(Ord. O-15-20, passed 6-8-2020)
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITY STANDARDS
§ 56.10 GENERALLY.
   The following development and design standards shall be used to review any
wireless communication facility permit application pursuant to this chapter.
Unless otherwise specified, all wireless communication facilities shall be
planned, designed, located, erected, operated, and maintained in accordance
with the following standards.
(Ord. O-15-20, passed 6-8-2020)
§ 56.11 GENERAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES STANDARDS.
   (A)   Wireless communication facilities shall comply with all development
standards within the applicable zoning district of the subject site, except
minimum site size, maximum site coverage, building setbacks, parking and
landscape coverage.
   (B)   Height limits for all wireless communication facilities shall be in
accordance with the design guidelines and federal law.
   (C)   All wireless communication facilities and accessory wireless equipment
shall comply with the applicable provisions of the village's noise ordinance §
132.15 and design guidelines. Note that such facilities located in parks or
playgrounds where the noise ordinance does not normally apply will be subject
to the limitations of the noise ordinance.
(Ord. O-15-20, passed 6-8-2020)
§ 56.12 VISUAL IMPACT MINIMIZATION AND SCREENING STANDARDS.
   (A)   All wireless communications facilities shall employ camouflage design
techniques to minimize visual impacts and provide appropriate screening. Such
techniques shall be employed to make the installation, operation and appearance
of the facility as visually inconspicuous as possible, to prevent the facility
from visually dominating the surrounding area, and to hide the installation
from predominant views from surrounding properties.
   (B)   Depending on the proposed site and surroundings, certain camouflage
design techniques may be deemed by the village as ineffective or inappropriate
and alternative techniques may be recommended. Sections
56.40 through
56.47 provides standards for potential camouflage design techniques that should
be considered based on different installation situations.
(Ord. O-15-20, passed 6-8-2020)

location; or
         (b)   The alternate location is within a distance that is equivalent
to the width of the right-of-way in which the new wireless support structure is
proposed, whichever is greater; and
         (c)   The operator shall use the alternate location if it has the
right to do so on reasonable terms and conditions and the alternate location
does not impose technical limits or additional costs.
      (2)   Waiver to village directed alternate wireless support structure
location or undergrounding requirements.
         (a)   Small cell operators may seek a waiver of the undergrounding or
alternative location requirements for the placement of a new wireless support
structure if the operator is unable to achieve its service objective using a
small cell facility under the following circumstances:
            1.   From a location in the right-of-way where the prohibition does
not apply;
            2.   In a utility easement within the right-of-way the operator has
the right to access; or
            3.   In or on other suitable locations or structures made available
by the village at reasonable rates, fees, and terms.

HISTORIC DISTRICT SPECIFIC STANDARDS
§ 56.70 GENERALLY.
   (A)   The village is one of only a few planned communities in the United
States. It was built in the early 1920s and modeled after a small town in
England. The mindful and detailed dedication to quality and aesthetics created
a unique and special community. As a result, Mariemont was awarded the
prestigious honor of being named a National Historic Landmark.
   (B)   The design and character of the right-of-way in the village is defined
by a variety of interconnected factors—the most prevalent are the functional
classification of the roadway within the right-of-way and the predominant land
uses along the right-of-way. These variables influence the amount of space
available in the right-of-way outside of the travel lanes for elements such as
sidewalks and shared-use paths, street trees, street lights and utility
infrastructure, as well as the aesthetic qualities of these elements.
   (C)   The Historic District is made up of the 'front doors' to businesses
and residences and possesses a strong pedestrian environment that should be
free of visual clutter along the streetscapes to the maximum extent possible.
   (D)   The unique environmental aesthetics of each Historic District area, as
well as the characteristics of the right-of-way itself must be taken into
consideration in the deployment of small cell facilities and wireless support
structures. These facilities must blend seamlessly into the surrounding context
to the maximum extent possible.
   (E)   Where conflicts exist between the design guidelines, §§
56.10 through
56.61 and the standards articulated in the Historic District Specific
Standards, §§
56.71 through
56.73, the language of Historic District Specific Standards shall take
precedence over the language of the design guidelines.

   (B)   Rights-of-way occupancy. Each person who occupies, uses or seeks to
occupy or use the rights-of-way to operate a system located in the rights- of-
way, or who has, or seeks to have, a system located in any rights-of-way, shall
apply for and obtain a certificate of registration pursuant to this chapter.
Any person owning, operating or maintaining a system in the rights-of-way
without a certificate of registration, including persons operating under a
permit, license or franchise issued by the village prior to the effective date
of this chapter shall apply for and obtain a certificate of registration from
the village, unless exempted by §
57.02(D). Application will consist of providing the information set forth in §
57.03 and as reasonably required by the Mayor.
   (C)   No construction without a certificate of registration. Following the
effective date of this chapter, no person shall construct or perform any work
on or in, or use any system or any part thereof located on or in any rights-of-
way without first obtaining a certificate of registration. Whoever violates
this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree as provided for in
§
57.99.
   (D)   Exceptions.
      (1)   The following entities are not obligated to obtain a certificate of
registration: The village and resellers of services or persons that do not own
any system or facilities in the rights-of-way.
      (2)   The following entities are required to participate in the
certificate of registration process, but shall be exempt from the financial
obligations of the application fee required by §
57.03(a) and the registration maintenance fee required by §
57.05(A): the Hamilton County, the village and cable operators for the purpose
of providing only cable service and operating pursuant to a valid cable
franchise and video service provider for the purpose of providing only video
service and operating pursuant to a valid video service authorization issued in
accordance with R.C. § 1332.24, the village and Hamilton County. In addition,
cable operators shall be exempt from any requirement of the certificate of
registration process that is in direct conflict with the requirements of, and/
or specifically exempted by, a valid current and valid cable franchise with the
village.
   (E)   Systems in place without a certificate of registration. Any system or
part of a system found in a right-of-way for which a certificate of
registration has not been obtained shall be deemed to be a nuisance and an
unauthorized use of the rights-of-way. The village may exercise any remedies or
rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to abating the
nuisance; taking possession of the facilities and/or non-complying portion of
such system; and/or prosecuting the violator.
   (F)   Future uses. In allowing providers and permittees to place facilities
in the rights-of-way, the village shall not be liable for any damages caused
thereby to any provider's facilities that are already in place or that shall be
placed in the rights-of-way unless those damages arise out of the sole
negligence, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud of the village. No
provider is entitled to rely on the provisions of this chapter as creating a
special duty to any provider.
   (G)   Discontinuance of operations, abandoned and unused facilities.
      (1)   A provider who has discontinued or is discontinuing its operations
of any system in the village shall:
         (a)   Provide information satisfactory to the village that the
provider's obligations for its system in the rights-of-way under this section
and any other sections in the Code of Ordinances have been lawfully assumed by
another applicant and/or provider; or
         (b)   Submit a written proposal to re-use its facilities in a manner
that promotes the village's goals of providing innovative and economic
solutions to efficiently and economically utilize limited rights-of-way
capacity. Such proposal must be approved by the Village Engineer; or
         (c)   Submit a written proposal for abandonment of facilities in place
indicating why good engineering practice would support this type of solution.
The Village Engineer must approve said proposal; or
         (d)   Completely remove all specifically identified portion(s) of its
system in a manner acceptable to the village within a reasonable amount of time
if the village believes that there exists a reasonable justification for such
removal; or
         (e)   Submit to the village within a reasonable amount of time and in
accordance with R.C. §§ 4905.20 and 4905.21, a proposal for transferring
ownership of its facilities to the village. If a provider proceeds under this
clause, the village may, at its option where lawful:
            1.   Purchase the facilities; or
            2.   Unless a valid removal bond has already been posted pursuant
to §
57.17(B), require the provider to post a bond in an amount sufficient to
reimburse the village for reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in
removing the facilities.
      (2)   Facilities of a provider who fail to comply with this section and
which remain unused facilities shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned
facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The village may exercise any remedies
or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to:
         (a)   Abating the nuisance;
         (b)   Taking possession of the facilities and restoring them to a
useable condition subject to a finding of the PUCO pursuant to the requirements
of R.C. §§ 4905.20 and 4905.21; or
         (c)   Requiring removal of the facilities by the provider or by the
provider's surety.
      (3)   If the village requires a provider to remove unused facilities in
any rights-of- way, the village shall use reasonable efforts to direct that
this removal occur in conjunction with other scheduled excavations of the
rights-of-way. If the village abates the nuisance it may take all action
necessary to recover its costs and to abate said nuisance, including but not
limited to, those methods set forth in R.C. § 715.261.
   (H)   Nature of issuance. A certificate of registration shall not convey
equitable or legal title in the rights-of-way. A certificate of registration is
only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy rights-of- way in the village,
for the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the certificate
of registration and in accordance with this chapter. The rights to occupy the
right-of-way may not be subdivided or subleased; provided, however, that two or
more providers may collocate facilities in the same area of the rights-of-way
so long as each such provider complies with the provisions of this chapter.
Collocating providers may file a joint application for a construction permit. A
certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from obtaining
appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its
facilities on facilities of others, including the village's facilities. A
certificate of registration does not prevent a provider from leasing space in
or on the provider's system, so long as the sharing of facilities does not
cause a violation of law, including the provisions of this chapter. A
certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from complying with any
provisions of the code or other applicable law.
   (I)   Other approvals, permits, and agreements. In addition to a certificate
of registration, providers shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals,
permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for the offering or provision of
such services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities and
upon the village's reasonable request, shall provide copies of such documents
to the village. Further, a certificate of registration issued pursuant to this
chapter shall not entitle a provider to use, alter, convert to, or interfere
with, the facilities, easements, poles, conduits, lines, pipelines, wires,
fiber, cable or any other real or personal property of any kind whatsoever
under the management or control of the village.

      (8)   Upon request of the village, a narrative (or if applicable PUCO/
FCC/FERC application information) describing applicant's proposed activities in
the village including credible information detailing applicant's financial,
managerial, and technical ability to fulfill applicant's obligations under this
chapter and carry on applicant's proposed activities.
   (C)   Criteria for issuance of a certificate of registration. In deciding
whether to issue a certificate of registration, the village shall consider:

contribute to the health, safety, and welfare of the village and its citizens.
      (2)   Whether the issuing of the certificate of registration will be
consistent with this chapter.
      (3)   Whether the applicant has submitted a complete application and has
secured all certificates and other authorizations required by law in order to
construct and operate a system in the manner proposed by the applicant

chapter and the issuance of a certificate of registration.
      (6)   Any other applicable law.
   (D)   Grant or denial of an application for a certificate of registration.
      (1)   The village, not later than 60 days after the date of filing by an

to obtain consent.
   (E)   Obligations of a provider upon receipt of a certificate of
registration. In addition to the other requirements set forth herein and in the
rules and regulations each provider shall:
      (1)   Use its best efforts to cooperate with other providers and users of

obtrusive use of rights-of-way, consistent with safety, and to minimize traffic
and other disruptions including street cuts; and
      (2)   When possible, participate in joint planning, construction and
advance notification of rights-of-way work, as may be required by the village;

      (3)   Upon reasonable written notice, and at the direction of the Mayor
or his or her designee, promptly remove or rearrange facilities as necessary
for public safety; and
      (4)   Perform all work, construction, maintenance or removal of
facilities within the rights-of-way, in accordance with good engineering,
construction and arboricultural practice (if applicable), including any
appropriate state building codes, safety codes and law and use best efforts to
repair and replace any street, curb or other portion of the rights-of-way, or
facilities located therein, to a condition to be determined by the Village
Engineer to be adequate under current standards and not less than materially
equivalent to its condition prior to such work and to do so in a manner which
minimizes any inconvenience to the public, the village and other providers, all
in accordance with all applicable provisions of this chapter, any rules and
regulations the village may adopt and the code of ordinances; and
      (5)   Construct, install, operate and maintain its facilities and system
in a manner consistent with all applicable laws, ordinances, construction
standards and governmental requirements including, but not limited to, The
National Electric Safety Code, National Electric Code and applicable FCC, FERC,

      (6)   Be on notice that removal of trees, or the use of vegetation
management programs within the rights-of-way of the village require prior
written approval by the Mayor or his or her designee. Any such activities,
unless an emergency, shall only be performed following the prior written
approval of the Mayor or his or her designee and must be performed in
accordance with standard horticultural and arboreal practices as promulgated by
entities such as the National Arbor Day Foundation, the International Society
of Arboriculture, and the Tree Care Industry, all as may be required by the
village. Pruning shall at a minimum meet or exceed the requirements of the most
current version of the American National Standards Institute ANSI A300
standard. Any additionally required horticultural and arboreal practices and
guidelines shall be described in the rules and regulations adopted by pursuant
to §
57.05(E). Emergency removal of trees or the use of vegetation management
programs within the rights-of- way of the village may be performed in rights-
of-way as described herein and in accordance with the rules and regulations,
but the Mayor shall be provided notice of such emergency work being performed
within two business days of the start of the work. Any non-emergency tree
removal or the use of vegetation management programs within the rights-of-way
that is performed without the Mayor or designee's written permission shall
subject a person to the penalties of §
57.99 and may further require that the tree or vegetation be replaced, at the
sole expense of the responsible person, with a healthy tree or vegetation of
like kind and quality; and
      (7)   Warrant that all worker facilities, conditions and procedures that
are used during construction, installation, operation and maintenance of the
provider's facilities within the rights-of-way shall comply with all applicable
standards of the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration; and
      (8)   Use its best efforts to cooperate with the village in any
emergencies involving the rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Provider shall, weather permitting, remove all graffiti within 21
calendar days of notice. Provider shall use all reasonable efforts to remove
any and all graffiti on any of the provider's facilities located within the
village rights-of-way. Should the provider fail to do so, the village may take
whatever action is necessary to remove the graffiti and bill the provider for
the cost thereof; and
      (10)   Providers shall use all reasonable efforts to field identify their
facilities in the rights-of-way whenever providers are notified by the village
that the village has determined that such identification is reasonably
necessary in order for the village to begin planning for the construction,
paving, maintenance, repairing, relocating or in any way altering any street or
area in the rights-of-way as defined in this chapter. The village shall notify
the providers of the village's date to begin the process at least 30 days prior
to the commencement of said activities. In field identifying facilities:
         (a)   Providers shall identify all facilities that are within the
affected rights- of-way using customary industry standards and distinct
identification; and
         (b)   Facilities will be so marked as to identify the provider
responsible for said facilities; and
         (c)   Should any such marking interfere with the facilities function,
create a safety problem or violate any safety code, alternative methods of
marking the facilities may be approved by the Village Engineer; and
         (d)   All marking should be clearly readable from the ground and
include provider's name, logo and identification numbering or tracking
information. No advertising will be permitted.
      (11)   A provider that is replacing an existing utility pole shall be
responsible to coordinate with all other providers to ensure the orderly
transfer of all lines or cables to the replacement utility pole, the removal of
the existing utility pole, and the restoration of the rights-of-way within 30
days weather permitting after the replacement utility pole is installed. Upon
request, the Village Engineer may grant the provider additional time for good
cause.
   (F)   Establishment of utility corridors.
      (1)   The Village Council may assign specific corridors within the
rights-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each
type of facilities that are, or that the Village Engineer expects may someday
be, located within the rights-of-way.
      (2)   Any provider whose facilities are in the rights-of-way and are in a
position at variance with utility corridors established by the Village Council
shall at the time of the next construction of the area, excluding normal
maintenance activities, move such facilities to their assigned position within
the rights-of-way. Existing underground facilities located within a designated
utility corridor shall not be required to relocate into adjacent or alternative
portions of the rights-of-way unless they are in conflict with an actual or
proposed public improvement project. The above requirements may be waived by
the Mayor for good cause shown including, but not limited to, consideration of
such factors as: the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety,
customer service needs, law precluding such undergrounding of facilities, and
hardship to the provider. If a provider is denied a requested waiver from the
above requirements, the provider may appeal the denial of the Mayor.
      (3)   The Village Engineer shall make every good faith attempt to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights-of-way as set forth
in this chapter.
      (4)   Providers may enter into written agreements to use existing poles
and conduits with the owners of same and shall use best efforts to install
their facilities within the rights-of-way.
      (5)   No facility placed in any rights-of-way shall be placed in such a
manner that interferes with normal travel on such rights-of-way.
      (6)   Unless otherwise stated in a certificate of registration, permit,
or division (F)(6)(c) of this section all facilities within the rights-of-way
shall be constructed and located in accordance with the code and with the
following provision:
         (a)   Whenever all existing facilities that have been traditionally
located overhead are located underground in a certain area within the village,
a provider who desires to place its facilities in the same area must also
locate its facilities underground.
         (b)   Whenever a provider is required to locate or relocate facilities
underground within a certain area of the village, every provider with
facilities within the same area of the village shall concurrently re-locate
their facilities underground.
         (c)   The above requirements may be waived by the village for good
cause shown including, but not limited to, consideration of such factors as:
the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, customer service
needs, law precluding such undergrounding of the facilities, and hardship to
the provider. If a provider is denied a requested waiver from the above
requirements, the provider may appeal the denial of the Village Engineer to the
Mayor.
(Ord. O-20-20, passed 10-26-2020)
§ 57.04 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Construction and major maintenance plan. Each provider shall, at the
time of initial application and by January 1 of each following year, file a
construction and major maintenance plan with the Building Department. Such
construction and major maintenance plan shall be provided for all geographical
areas requested by the Village Engineer, up to and including the entire
geographical area of the village. It shall be submitted using a format(s)
mutually agreeable to the provider and the village and shall contain the
information determined by the Village Engineer to be necessary to facilitate
the coordination and reduction in the frequency of construction in the rights-
of-way. The construction and major maintenance plan shall include, but not be
limited to, all currently scheduled and/or anticipated construction projects
for the next calendar year, if none are scheduled or anticipated then the plan
shall so state. The provider shall use its best efforts in supplying this
information and shall update the construction and major maintenance plan on
file with the Building Department whenever there is a material change in
scheduled and/or anticipated construction projects. In an effort to assist
providers with the completion of their annual construction and major
maintenance plan, the Building Department Commissioner, as soon as possible,
will send each provider's system representative a descriptive narrative (and
any mapping information reasonably available) for all the planned right-of-way
improvements and/or scheduled maintenance that the village then currently
intends to undertake during the calendar year.
   (B)   Mapping data. With the filing of its application for a certificate of
registration, a provider shall be required to accurately inform the village of
the number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of right-of-way the
provider's system then currently occupies and begin submitting to the village
all information that currently exists (actual street address range) and which
can be provided regarding the location of its facilities in the right-of-way in
hard copy or in the most advanced format (including, but not limited to,
electronic and/or digital format (preferred) then currently being used by the
provider that is then currently capable of technologically being read (or
readily converted to a readable form) by the village. Unless otherwise required
by §
57.13(B), a provider shall have up to one year from the date of the provider's
initial filing of an application for a certificate of registration to
completely submit all the mapping data for a provider's system in the entire
geographical area of the village which it owns or over which it has control
that are located in any rights-of- way of the village in the most advanced
format (including, but not be limited to electronic and/or digital format) then
currently being used by the provider that is then currently capable of
technologically being read (or readily converted to a readable form) by the
village. The mapping data is only required to be at the "atlas" level of detail
necessary for the village to reasonably determine the location of the
provider's facilities in the rights-of- way. The provider shall supply the
mapping data on paper if the Village Engineer determines that the format
currently being used by the provider is not capable of being read by the
village. Any time after the issuance of a certificate of registration, and upon
the reasonable request of the Village Engineer, a provider shall be required to
provide to the village any additional location information for any facilities
which it owns or over which it has control that are located in any rights-of-
way of the village required by the village. Any and all actual direct,
incidental and indirect costs incurred by the village during the process of
reviewing, inputting and/or converting a provider's mapping information to
comport with the village's then current standard format (whether electronic or
otherwise) shall be directly billed to, and must be timely remitted by, the
provider. Failure to pay such mapping costs within 60 days of receipt of an
invoice shall subject an applicant or provider to revocation of its certificate
of registration and the penalties of §
57.99. Further, each provider that has been issued a certificate of
registration shall accurately inform the village on or before each subsequent
January 1 of the number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of right-of-
way the provider's system then occupied as of the immediately previous December
1. The Village Engineer may, in the future, adopt additional specifications and
further define or modify the mapping data requirements under this section for
reasons including, but not limited to, changes in technology or the law
regarding public disclosure of a provider's mapping information. When the
village modifies and/or amends the mapping data requirements, the village shall
use best efforts to avoid unreasonably increasing the burden to the providers
that may be associated with satisfying the amended mapping requirements. When
the mapping requirements of division (B) of this section are amended, each
provider shall be served with a copy of the new specifications or modifications
by regular U.S. mail to the system representative identified in each
certificate of registration and in accordance with §
57.19(B); provided, however, that any failure of any provider to actually
receive such notice shall not in any way affect the validity or enforceability
of said specifications or modifications.
   (C)   Exemption from disclosure. A provider shall notify the village if the
provider believes that any specific document or portion of a document being
submitted to the village is exempt from the public records disclosure
requirements of R.C. § 149.43. The notification shall be in writing and
indicate the specific documentor portion of a document that the provider
believes is exempt from disclosure. The notification shall include the legal
basis for the claimed exemption, including the applicable statutory reference
and any additional information necessary to make a determination of exemption
for each specific document or portion of a document. If a public records
request is made for documents submitted by a provider, the village will
consider the written notification in making its own independent determination
of whether a specific document or a portion of a document is exempt from the
disclosure requirements of R.C. § 149.43. To the extent permitted by law, the
village will endeavor to use reasonable best efforts to notify the provider of
the request prior to making the document available for inspection or copying.

§ 57.05 COMPENSATION FOR CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   (A)   Compensation. As compensation for the village's costs to administer
this chapter, manage, administer and control the rights-of-way and maintain
each certificate of registration issued, every provider or any person operating
a system shall pay to the village registration maintenance fees beginning
January 1, 2009. The registration maintenance fee shall be determined and
assessed to providers and other persons operating a system or otherwise using
and occupying the rights-of-way in accordance with the following process and
formula:
      (1)   The village by January 31 of each year shall calculate all actual
and incurred costs associated with rights-of-way management, administration and
control for the previous calendar year that the village was not able to
reasonably recover through construction permit fees or other recovery
mechanisms provided for in this chapter.
      (2)   Providers and applicants, as required in §
57.04(B), shall accurately inform the village upon application for a
certificate of registration and on or before each subsequent January 1 of the
number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of right-of-way the provider's
system then occupied as of the immediately previous December 1.
      (3)   The village shall total the entire number of miles of right-of-way
reported as being used or occupied by all providers.
      (4)   The village shall divide the calculated costs referenced in
division (A)(1) of this section by the total number of miles of right-of-way
reported as being used or occupied by all providers as referenced in division
(A)(3) of this section to arrive at a per-mile cost number.
      (5)   The village shall then multiply each provider's mileage calculation
as referenced in division (A)(2) of this section by the per-mile cost
calculation referenced in division (A)(4) of this section. The product shall be
a provider's then current annual registration maintenance fee.
      (6)   The village shall perform its calculation of registration
maintenance fees every three years following receipt of the providers required
January 1 mileage report. Registration maintenance fees shall be invoiced to
providers on or about February 1 of each calendar year and shall be due 30 days
following receipt.
      (7)   Cable companies operating under non-exclusive cable franchises for
the purposes of providing cable service, video services provider operating
under a VSA for the purpose of providing video services, and providers of open
video system services, which compensate the village under other mechanisms in
an amount equal to or greater than the annual registration maintenance fee that
would normally be required for their right-of-way use in the village, shall
have the mileage of the right-of-way they use and/or occupy included in the
calculations described in this section, but shall not be required to contribute
to the recovery of rights-of-way costs as defined by this chapter with the
exception of permit costs.
      (8)   The village may by separate legislation enacted by Council on or
about January 31 of each year, in accordance with the results of division (A)
(4) of this section, enact an initial and thereafter a new annual registration
maintenance fee (per mile) by appropriately increasing or decreasing the
previous year's registration maintenance fee (per mile). Revised registration
maintenance fees shall be effective upon passage.
   (B)   Timing. Registration maintenance fees shall be invoiced to providers
on or about February 1st of each calendar year and shall be due 30 days
following receipt Registration maintenance fees shall be paid in full for the
first year of the registration as a condition of the certificate of
registration becoming effective. Fees may be prorated from the effective date
of the certificate of registration to the end of the calendar year if less than
one full year.
   (C)   Taxes and assessments. To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by taxing authorities on the use of village property as a result of a
provider's use or occupation of the rights-of-way, the provider shall be
responsible for payment of such taxes. Such payments shall be in addition to
any other fees payable pursuant to this chapter and shall not be considered an
offset to, or in lieu of, the fees and charges listed in this chapter. The
registration maintenance fee is not in lieu of any tax, fee, or other
assessment except as specifically provided in this chapter, or as required by
applicable law.
   (D)   Interest on late payments. In the event that any registration
maintenance fee is not paid to the village by January 31, the provider shall
pay a monthly late charge of 1% of the unpaid balance for each month or any
portion thereof for which payment is not made.
   (E)   No accord and satisfaction. No acceptance by the village of any
registration maintenance fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount
paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such
registration maintenance fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the
village may have for additional sums payable.
(Ord. O-20-20, passed 10-26-2020)
§ 57.06 OVERSIGHT AND REGULATION.
   (A)   Reports. Upon reasonable request of the Mayor, a provider shall
provide the village with a list of any and all material communications, public
reports, petitions, or other filings, either received from or submitted to any
municipal, county, state or federal agency or official (and any response
thereto submitted by or received by a provider), and any other information or
report reasonably related to a provider's obligations under this chapter which
in any way materially affects the operation of the system or a provider's
representations and warranties set forth herein, but not including tax returns
or other filings which are confidential. Upon request, a provider shall
promptly, but in no case later than 30 business days following the request,
deliver to the village a complete copy of any item on said list. Upon the
request of the village, a provider shall promptly submit to the village any
information or report reasonably related to a provider's obligations under this
chapter, its business and operations with respect to the system or its
operation, in such form and containing such information as the village shall
specify. Such information or report shall be accurate and complete and supplied
within 30 days.
   (B)   Confidentiality. All information submitted to the village that is
considered confidential/proprietary information must be clearly marked as such
when submitted. A provider, at any time after submitting information without
confidential/proprietary information markings, may request and shall be
provided the opportunity to, subsequently mark any provided information as
confidential/proprietary information. The village shall exercise all reasonable
legal protections so as not to publicly disclose to any third party such
information unless required by law. The village shall, following receipt of a
request for public disclosure of clearly marked trade secret and/or proprietary
information submitted by a provider, endeavor to use reasonable best efforts to
timely place the provider's system representative on notice that such a request
for public disclosure has been made.
   (C)   Provider's expense. All reports and records required under this
chapter shall be furnished at the sole expense of a provider.
   (D)   Right of inspection and audit. The village's designated
representatives shall have the right to inspect, examine, or audit during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to a provider under the
circumstances; documents, records, or other information which pertain to a
provider's operation of a system within the village that are related to its
obligations under this chapter. All such documents shall be made available
within the village or in such other place that the village may agree upon in
writing in order to facilitate said inspection, examination, or audit.
   (E)   Rules and regulations. The Village Engineer may propose, and Village
Council may adopt (and from time to time amend) the rules and regulations
regarding this chapter, construction standards and occupancy requirements of
the right-of- way. Such rules and regulations shall not materially increase the
obligation of any provider hereunder, provided however that none of the
following shall in any way be considered a material increase in obligation; the
adoption of rules and regulations increasing fees; the requiring of the
placement of facilities in designated portions of the rights-of-way
(underground or otherwise); the overbuilding of facilities; or the requiring of
joint-builds. Prior to the adoption or amendment of the rules and regulations,
the village shall provide written notice and a copy of the proposed language of
such adoption or amendment, via United States regular mail, to each provider
who holds a then current certificate of registration. Each provider shall then
have 30 days following the date of the village's mailing to provide written
comment regarding the proposed language to the village. At least 45 days, but
not more than 60 days following the date of the village's mailing, the village
shall schedule and hold a meeting, to make available a forum at which all then
current providers may address any questions, concerns and make reasonable
suggestions regarding the proposed new rules and regulations to the village.
The Village Engineer shall, following said meeting and the review of the
providers' comments and suggestions, adopt or amend the rules and regulations
in a manner that best serves the village, for approval by Village Council.

§ 57.09 CIVIL FORFEITURES.
   In addition to any other penalties set forth in this chapter and the remedy
of specific performance, which may be enforced in a court of competent
jurisdiction, the Mayor may assess an additional penalty of civil forfeiture
for failure to comply with any provision of this chapter. Such penalty shall be
a monetary sum, payable to the village, in the amount of $500 per 24-hour day
of violation and any subsequent portion of a day less than 24 hours in length.
Prior to assessing said penalty, the village will provide written notice to the
provider detailing the failure to comply with a specific provision of this
chapter. Such notice shall also indicate that said penalty shall be assessed in
15 calendar days subsequent to the date of receipt if compliance is not
achieved. If a provider desires to challenge such penalty, provider must
request a public hearing before the Village Council within ten days of service
of the notice. Such public hearing shall be held within 30 days of the
provider's request. If provider requests such hearing before the Village
Council, such penalty shall be temporarily suspended. However, if, after the
public hearing, the Village Council determines that provider failed to comply
with the specific provision(s) of this chapter referenced in the notice, such
penalty shall be assessed starting with the 15 calendar days after receipt of
the notice referenced in this section and continuing each day thereafter until
compliance is achieved. The determination of the Village Council shall be
final. The provider may file an administrative appeal pursuant to R.C. Chapter

all the actual and incurred construction permit issuance, inspection,
oversight, enforcement and regulation costs for the previous calendar year
including the value of the degradation and reduction in the useful life of the
rights-of-way that will result from construction that takes place therein.
"Degradation and the reduction in the useful life" for the purpose of this
section means the accelerated depreciation of the rights-of-way caused by
construction in or disturbance of the rights- of-way, resulting in the need to
reconstruct or repair such rights-of-way earlier than would be required if the
construction did not occur.
      (3)   The village, on or about January 1 of each year, shall total all
the construction permit fee receipts received in accordance with the scheduled
fees required by the prior year's construction permit fees for the previous
calendar year.
      (4)   The village shall divide the calculated costs referenced in
division (D)(2) of this section by the total construction permit fees received
as referenced in division (D)(3) of this section to arrive at a numerical
factor representing the previous year's cost versus receipts analysis.
      (5)   The village shall multiply the then currently codified construction
permit fees by the numerical factor as referenced in division (D)(4) of this
section to calculate revised permit fees for the new calendar year.
      (6)   The village shall act, on or about January 31 of each year, in
accordance with the results of division (D)(5) of this section, to codify new
annual permit fees by separate legislation enacted by Council by appropriately
increasing or decreasing the previous year's permit fees. Revised permit fees
shall be effective upon passage. Any permit requests pending on the date of any
annual permit fee modification shall be subject to all new permit fees as
modified.
      (7)   Except as provided in division (D)(8) of this section, no
construction permit shall be issued without payment of construction permit fees
except to the village which shall be exempt. Construction permit fees that were
paid for a permit that the village has revoked due to breach and in accordance
with the terms of §§
57.10 or
57.16(E) are not refundable.
      (8)   The Building Department may permit a provider to make quarterly
payments of construction permit fees based upon the provider's financial
condition and past payment history. The quarterly payment shall be due and
payable within 30 days after the end of the quarter. The Village Fiscal Officer
may revoke this permission due to a change in financial condition, late
payment, or other just cause.
   (E)   Joint applications. Applicants are encouraged to submit joint
applications for construction permits to work in the rights-of-way at the same
place and time. Joint applicants shall have the ability to divide amongst
themselves, in proportions the parties find appropriate, any applicable
construction permit fees.

third party (excluding the village) or another permittee, a permittee shall
conduct a utility engineering study on the proposed route of construction
expansion or relocation if requested by the Village Engineer. Where such
construction and/or relocation is requested or caused by a third party, every
permittee located within the rights-of-way at issue or involved with the work
shall use all best efforts to cooperate and assist any other permittee or
person who is directed by the village to perform the required utility
engineering study. A utility engineering study consists of, at minimum,
completion of the following tasks:
         (a)   Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats and other location
data indicating the existence and approximate location of all facilities along
the proposed construction route.
         (b)   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
facilities along the proposed construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts and visible street cut repairs.
         (c)   Determine and record the presence and precise location of all
underground facilities the applicant or person on whose behalf the permit was
applied for owns or controls in the rights- of-way along the proposed system
route. Upon request of the Village Engineer, a permittee shall also record and
identify the general location of all other facilities in the rights-of-way
along the proposed system route. For the purposes of this section, general
location shall mean the alignment of other facilities in the rights-of- way but
shall not necessarily mean the depth of other facilities in the rights-of-way.
         (d)   Plot and incorporate the data obtained from completion of the
tasks described in division (A)(1)(a) through (A)(1)(c) of this section on the
construction permittee's proposed system route maps and construction plans,
along with the locations of the proposed facilities and all other topographic
and cadastral information.
         (e)   Where the proposed location of facilities and the location of
existing underground facilities appear to conflict on the plans drafted in
accordance with division (A)(1)(d) of this section, permittee has the option of
either utilizing non-destructive digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at
the critical points identified to determine as precisely as possible, the
horizontal, vertical and spatial position, composition, size and other
specifications of the conflicting underground facilities, or re-designing the
construction plans to eliminate the apparent conflict. Unless waived by the
Village Engineer, a permittee shall not excavate more than a 12-inch hole in
the rights-of-way to complete this task for each apparent conflict. Any
surfaces damaged shall be immediately repaired by the permittee. A minimum of
two working days' notice shall be provided to the village prior to performing
these investigations.
         (f)   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this section, adjust the proposed system design to avoid the need
to relocate other underground facilities.
      (2)   The Village Engineer may modify the scope of the utility
engineering study as necessary depending on the proposed construction plans.
   (B)   Copy to village. Upon completion of the tasks described in division
(A) of this section, the construction permittee shall submit, if necessary
labeled in accordance with the requirements of §
57.06(B), the proposed system route maps and construction plans, with the
results of the utility engineering study, in the most advanced format
(including, but not be limited to electronic and/or digital format) then
currently being used by the provider that is then currently capable of
technologically being read (or readily converted to a readable form) by the
village. The mapping data is only required to be at the "atlas" level of detail
necessary for the village to reasonably determine the location of the
provider's facilities in the rights-of- way. The provider shall supply the
mapping data on paper if the Village Engineer determines that the format
currently being used by the provider is not capable of being read by the
village.
   (C)   Qualified firm. All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to
this section shall be performed by the permittee if in the discretion of the
Village Engineer the construction permittee is qualified to complete the
project itself, alternatively utility engineering studies shall be performed by
a firm specializing in utility engineering.
   (D)   Cost of study. The permittee shall bear the cost of compliance with
division (A) through (C) of this section.
   (E)   Construction schedule. Unless otherwise provided for in this chapter
or in the rules and regulations, or unless the Village Engineer waives any of
the requirements of this section due to unique or unusual circumstances, a
permittee shall be required to submit a written construction schedule to the
village not less than five working days before commencing any work in or about
the rights-of-way, and shall further notify the village not less than two
working days in advance of any excavation in the rights-of-way. This section
shall apply to all situations with the exception of circumstances under §
57.16(D)(1) (emergency situations) and §
57.15  (minor maintenance).
   (F)   Location of facilities.
      (1)   The placement of new facilities and replacement of old facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable laws and the village's rules and regulations. Detailed plans and
applicable specifications shall be submitted to the village for review and
approval prior to construction of any facilities except those that are
categorized as "minor maintenance" issues as per §
57.15.
      (2)   The village shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement
of new or additional facilities within the rights-of-way if the right-of-way is
full. In making such decisions, the village shall strive to the extent possible
to accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights-of-way, but shall
be guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety and welfare,
the condition of the rights-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential
utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the rights-of-way, future
village and county plans for public improvements, development projects which
have been determined to be in the public interest and nondiscriminatory and
competitively neutral treatment among providers.
   (G)   Least disruptive technology. All construction or maintenance of
facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of
damage and disruption of the rights-of-way. Specifically, every permittee when
performing underground construction, if technically and/or technologically
feasible and not economically unreasonable, shall utilize trenchless
technology, including, but not limited to, horizontal drilling, directional
boring, or micro-tunneling of pavement, driveways, and other sensitive
topographic areas. In addition, all cable, wire or fiber optic cable installed
in the subsurface rights-of-way pursuant to this chapter may be required to be
installed in conduit, and if so required, no cable, wire or fiber optic cable
may be installed pursuant to this chapter using "direct bury" techniques.
   (H)   Special exceptions. The village may grant a special exception to the
requirements of divisions (F) and (G) of this section if a permittee, upon
application, demonstrates with written evidence that:
      (1)   The exception will not create any threat to the public health,
safety or welfare.
      (2)   Permittee demonstrates that the increased economic burden and the
potential adverse impact on the permittee's construction schedule resulting
from the strict enforcement of the requirement actually or effectively inhibits
the ability of the permittee to provide services in the village.
      (3)   The permittee demonstrates that the requirement unreasonably
discriminates against the permittee in favor of another person.
      (4)   The requirements requested by the village herein create an
unreasonable economic burden for the permittee that outweighs any potential
benefit to the village.
   (I)   Relocation of facilities.
      (1)   A provider shall as promptly as reasonably possible and at its own
expense, permanently remove and relocate its facilities in the rights-of-way
whenever the village finds it necessary to require such removal and relocation.
In instances where the village requires removal and/or relocation, the village
shall waive all applicable construction permit fees. Upon removal and/or
relocation, the provider shall restore the rights-of-way to the same or better
condition it was in prior to said removal or relocation. If existing poles are
required to be removed and/or relocated, then the existing poles will be
replaced with poles of the same or similar size. In accordance with law, the
village may request relocation and/or removal in order to prevent unreasonable
interference by the provider's facilities with:
         (a)   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the village.
         (b)   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the rights-of-way.
         (c)   The sale, conveyance, vacation, or narrowing of all or any part
of a right-of- way.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider who has facilities in the
rights- of-way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the
purposes of the village, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated
portion or excess portion in conformity with R.C. § 723.041.
      (3)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the village, a provider fails to
commence removal and/or relocation of its facilities as designated by the
village, within 30 days after the village's removal order, or if a provider
fails to substantially complete such removal, including all associated repair
of the rights-of-way of the village, within 12 months thereafter, then, to the
extent not inconsistent with applicable law, the village shall have the right
to:
         (a)   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the facilities
belong to the village with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited
to, the right to connect and use the facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the facilities to another person for operation; or
         (b)   Authorize removal of the facilities installed by the provider
in, on, over or under the rights-of-way of the village at provider's cost and
expense, by another person; however, the village shall have no liability for
any damage caused by such action and the provider shall be liable to the
village for all reasonable costs incurred by the village in such action; and
         (c)   To the extent consistent with applicable law, any portion of the
provider's facilities in, on, over or under the rights- of-way of the village
designated by the village for removal and not timely removed by the provider
shall belong to and become the property of the village without payment to the
provider, and the provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the
village shall request, in form and substance acceptable to the village, to
evidence such ownership by the village.
   (J)   Pre-excavation facilities location.
      (1)   Before the start date of any rights-of-way excavation, each
provider who has facilities located in the area to be excavated shall, to the
best of its ability, mark the horizontal and approximate vertical placement of
all its facilities.
      (2)   All providers shall notify and work closely with the excavation
contractor in an effort to establish the exact location of its facilities and
the best procedure for excavation.
   (K)   Rights-of-way restoration.
      (1)   The work to be done under the permit, and the restoration of the
rights-of-way as required herein, weather permitting, must be completed within
the dates specified in the permit. In addition to its own work, the permittee
must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including
trench backfill, paving and its foundations in accordance with the code and
rules and regulations. If a permittee is unable to timely complete the
restoration of rights-of- way due to unreasonable inclement weather conditions,
the permittee shall provide interim surface restoration as directed by the
engineer, and complete the restoration of the rights-of-way as soon as weather
conditions make it possible to do so and upon said completion notify the
village.
      (2)   In approving an application for a construction permit, the village
may choose either to have the permittee restore the rights-of-way or
alternatively to restore the rights-of-way itself if the permittee has in the
past not abided by requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   If the village allows a permittee to restore the rights-of-way, the
permittee may at the time of application for a construction permit be required
to post a construction bond in an amount submitted by the permittee with a
detailed cost breakdown to the Village Engineer for approval that is sufficient
to cover the cost of restoring the rights-of- way to its approximate pre-
excavation condition. If, 12 months after completion of the restoration of the
rights-of-way, the village determines that the rights- of-way have been
properly restored, the surety on the construction bond shall be released.
      (4)   The permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and
with the materials specified by the village. The village shall have the
authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration and may do so
in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The
village in exercising this authority shall be guided by the following standards
and considerations: the number, size, depth and duration of the excavations,
disruptions or damage to the rights-of-way; the traffic volume carried by the
rights-of-way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the rights-of-way;
the pre-excavation condition of the rights-of-way; the remaining life-
expectancy of the rights-of-way affected by the excavation; whether the
relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable
balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the rights-of-way
that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the
rights-of-way; and the likelihood that the particular method of restoration
would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the rights-of-way that would
otherwise take place. Methods of restoration may include, but are not limited
to, patching the affected area, replacement of the rights-of-way base at the
affected area, and in the most severe cases; milling, overlay and/or street
reconstruction of the entire area of the rights-of-way affected by the work.
      (5)   By restoring the rights-of-way itself, the permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for 12 months following its completion. During this
12-month period, it shall, upon notification from the Mayor, correct all
restoration work to the extent necessary using the method required by the
Village Engineer. Weather permitting, said work shall be completed within five
calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the Mayor, unless otherwise
extended by the Mayor.
      (6)   If the permittee fails to restore the rights-of-way in the manner
and to the condition required by the village, or fails to satisfactorily and
timely complete all repairs required by the village, the village, at its
option, may do such work or by its contractor of choice. In that event, the
permittee shall pay to the village, within 30 days of billing, the restoration
cost of restoring the rights-of-way and any other costs incurred by the
village. Upon failure to pay, the village may call upon any bond or letter of
credit posted by permittee and/or pursue any and all legal and equitable
remedies.
      (7)   If the work to be done under the permit is being done at the same
location and the same period of time as work by the village and/or another
permittee(s), then the Mayor may reasonably apportion the restoration
responsibility among the village, providers and/or other persons.
   (L)   Damage to other facilities.
      (1)   In the case of an emergency, and if possible after reasonable
efforts to contact the provider seeking a timely response, when the village
performs work in the rights-of-way and finds it necessary, as may be allowed by
law, to maintain, support, or move a provider's facilities to protect those
facilities, the costs associated therewith will be billed to that provider and
shall be paid within 30 days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the
village may pursue all legal and equitable remedies in the event a provider
does not pay or the village may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted
by the permittee and pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies. Each
provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
facilities of another provider caused during the village's response to an
emergency occasioned by that provider's facilities.
      (2)   Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
village-owned facilities in the rights-of-way which the provider or its
facilities damage.
   (M)   Rights-of-way vacation. If the village sells or otherwise transfers a
rights-of-way which contains the facilities of a provider, such sale or
transfer shall be subject to any existing easements of record and any easements
required pursuant to R.C. § 723.041.
   (N)   Installation requirements. The excavation, backfilling, restoration,
and all other work performed in the rights-of-way shall be performed in
conformance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, other standards as
may be promulgated by the Village Engineer.
   (O)   Inspection. When the construction under any permit hereunder is
completed, the permittee shall notify the village.
      (1)   The permittee shall make the construction site available to the
inspector and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the construction.
      (2)   At the time of inspection, the inspector may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public, violates any law or which violates the term and
conditions of the permit and/or this chapter.
      (3)   The inspector may issue an order to the permittee for any work
which does not conform to the permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or
codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be
cause for revocation of the permit. The order may be served on the permittee as
provided in §
57.19(B). An order may be appealed to the Mayor. The decision of the Mayor may
be appealed to the Village Council whose decision shall be final. If not
appealed, within ten days after issuance of the order, the provider shall
present proof to the Mayor that the violation has been corrected. If such proof
has not been presented within the required time, the Mayor may revoke the
permit pursuant to §
57.16(E).
   (P)   Other obligations.
      (1)   Obtaining a construction permit does not relieve permittee of its
duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay
all fees required by any other laws.
      (2)   Permittee shall comply with all requirements of all laws, including
the Ohio Utility Protection Service.
      (3)   Permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable
laws and standards and is responsible for all work done in the rights-of-way
pursuant to its permit, regardless of who performs the work.
      (4)   No rights-of-way obstruction or excavation may be performed when
seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except
in the case of an emergency as outlined in §
57.16(D)(1).
      (5)   Permittee shall not obstruct a right-of-way so that the natural
free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with. The Village Engineer may waive this requirement if it is
technically or economically unreasonable in the circumstances.
      (6)   Private vehicles other than necessary construction vehicles may not
be parked within or adjacent to a permit area. The loading or unloading of
trucks adjacent to a permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized
by the permit.
   (Q)   Undergrounding required. Any owner of property abutting upon a street
or alley where service facilities are now located underground and where the
service connection is at the property line, shall install or cause others to
install underground any service delivery infrastructure from the property line
to the buildings or other structures on such property to which such service is
supplied. Where not otherwise required to be placed underground by this
chapter, a provider shall locate facilities underground at the request of an
adjacent property owner, provided that such placement of facilities underground
is consistent with the provider's normal construction and operating standards
and that the additional costs of such undergrounding over the normal aerial or
above ground placement costs of identical facilities are borne directly by the
property owner making the request. A provider, under any circumstance shall,
upon the reasonable request of the village, always use best efforts to place
facilities underground. Where technically possible and not economically
unreasonable or unsafe (based upon the technology employed and facilities
installed), all facilities to be installed by a provider under the right-of-way
shall be installed in conduit.

57.99
§ 57.15 MINOR MAINTENANCE PERMIT.
   (A)   Right-of-way minor maintenance permit requirement. No person shall
perform minor maintenance of facilities in the rights-of-way without first
having obtained a right-of-way minor maintenance permit as set forth in this
chapter. Minor maintenance means: (i) the routine repair or replacement of
facilities with like facilities not involving construction and not requiring
traffic control for more than two hours at any one location; (ii) or the
routine repair or replacement of facilities with like facilities not involving
construction and taking place on thoroughfares and arteries between the hours
of 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.; (iii) or the routine repair or replacement of
facilities with like facilities not involving construction on all rights-of-
ways, other than thoroughfares and arterials, that does not impede traffic and
is for a period of less than eight contiguous hours; (iv) or construction other
than on thoroughfares and arterials that takes less than eight contiguous hours
to complete, does not impede traffic and does not involve a pavement cut; or
(v) minor and/or non-material vegetation management/tree pruning. The Village
Engineer may adopt rules and regulations pursuant to §
57.06(E) that clarify the definition of minor maintenance and/or provide a
process for a provider to determine whether particular activity constitutes
minor maintenance.
      (1)   A right-of-way minor maintenance permit allows the right-of-way
minor maintenance permittee to perform all minor maintenance in any part of the
rights-of-way as required.
      (2)   A right-of-way minor maintenance permit is valid from the date of
issuance until revoked by the Building Department Commissioner and/or the
Village Engineer.
      (3)   A right-of-way minor maintenance permit must be displayed or upon
request produced within 12 business hours.
      (4)   A right-of-way minor maintenance permit by itself shall under no
circumstances provide a permittee with the ability to cut pavement without
seeking additional authority from the Building Department and/or the Village
Engineer.
   (B)   Right-of-way minor maintenance permit applications. Application for a
right-of-way minor maintenance permit shall be made to the Building Department.
In addition to any information required by the village, all right-of-way minor
maintenance permit applications shall contain, and will only be considered
complete upon compliance with the following provisions:
      (1)   Credible evidence that the applicant has obtained a certificate of
registration or proof that the applicant has written authority to apply for a
right-of-way minor maintenance permit on behalf of a party that has been issued
a certificate of registration.
      (2)   Submission of a completed right-of-way minor maintenance permit
application in the form required by the village.
      (3)   A statement that the applicant will employ protective measures and
devices that, consistent with the OMUTCD, will prevent injury or damage to
persons or property and to minimize disruptions to the efficient movement of
pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
   (C)   Issuance of right-of-way minor maintenance permits; conditions.
      (1)   If the Village Engineer determines that the applicant has satisfied
the requirements of this chapter and the right-of-way minor maintenance permit
process, the Village Engineer shall issue a right-of-way minor maintenance
permit subject to the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   The village may impose reasonable conditions, in addition to the
rules and regulations enacted by the Village Engineer, upon the issuance of the
right-of-way minor maintenance permit and the performance of the right-of-way
minor maintenance permittee thereunder in order to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, to insure the structural integrity of the rights-of-way,
to protect the property and safety of other users of the rights-of- way, and to
minimize the disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public.
   (D)   Right-of-way minor maintenance permit fees. The village shall not
charge a fee for the issuance of the right-of-way minor maintenance permit but
may revoke the right-of-way minor maintenance permit as any other permit may be
revoked under this chapter.
(Ord. O-20-20, passed 10-26-2020) Penalty, see §
57.99
§ 57.16 ENFORCEMENT OF PERMIT OBLIGATION.
   (A)   Mandatory denial of permit. Except in the case of an emergency, no
permit will be granted:
      (1)   To any person who has not yet made an application; or
      (2)   To any person who has outstanding debt owed to the village unless
payment in full has been placed in an escrow account approved by the Village
Fiscal Officer and the Village Solicitor; or
      (3)   To any person as to whom there exists grounds for the revocation of
a permit; or
      (4)   If, in the discretion of the Village Engineer, the issuance of a
permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict or interfere
with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The Village
Engineer, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by the safety and
convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the rights-of-way, and by
considerations relating to the public health, safety and welfare.
   (B)   Permissive denial of permit. The Village Engineer may deny a permit in
order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to prevent interference
with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the rights-of-way, or
when necessary to protect the rights-of-way and its users.
      (1)   The Village Engineer, in his or her discretion, may consider one or
more of the following factors:
         (a)   The extent to which rights-of-way space where the permit is
sought is available; and/or
         (b)   The competing demands for the particular space in the rights-of-
way; and/or
         (c)   The availability of other locations in the rights-of-way or in
other rights- of-way for the proposed facilities; and/or
         (d)   The applicability of this chapter or other regulations of the
rights-of-way that affect location of facilities in the rights-of-way; and/or
         (e)   The degree of compliance of the provider with the terms and
conditions of its certificate of registration, this chapter, and other
applicable ordinances and regulations; and/or
         (f)   The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and
businesses that will result from the use of that part of the rights- of-way;
and/or
         (g)   The condition and age of the rights-of-way, and whether and when
it is scheduled for total or partial re-construction; and/or
         (h)   The balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and
damage to the rights-of-way, against the benefits to that part of the public
served by the expansion into additional parts of the rights-of-way; and/or
         (i)   Whether such applicant or its agent has failed within the past
three years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance with, the
requirements of this chapter or, if applicable, any other law.
      (2)   Under no circumstances will open cutting take place on a newly
constructed street within 24 months after construction completion or a newly
reconstructed street within 24 months of reconstruction completion, except
where:
         (a)   An emergency situation requires that an open cut is necessary;
and/or
         (b)   Vital services to resident(s) or business(es) are needed or have
been cut off and there is no reasonable alternative (such as jacking or boring)
in supplying or restoring such services; and/or
         (c)   The Village Engineer determines it is in the best interests of
the village that such an open cut take place.
   (C)   Discretionary issuance of permit.
      (1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (A)(1) and (A)(2) of
this section, the Building Department may issue a permit in any case where the
permit is necessary;
         (a)   To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the
permit applicant, if established by credible evidence satisfactory to the
village; or
         (b)   To allow such customer to materially improve its service; or
         (c)   To allow a new economic development project to be granted a
permit under this section.
      (2)   To be granted a permit under this section, the permit applicant
must not have had knowledge of the hardship, the plans for improvement of
service, or the development project when it was required to submit its list of
next year projects.
   (D)   Work done without a permit in emergency situations.
      (1)   Each provider shall, as soon as is practicable, immediately notify
the Village Fiscal Officer of any event regarding its facilities which it
considers to be an emergency. The provider may proceed to take whatever actions
are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. Within five business days,
unless otherwise extended by the Village Engineer, after the occurrence or
discovery of the emergency (whichever is later), the provider shall apply for
the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest
of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter
for any and all actions taken in response to the emergency. In the event that
the village becomes aware of an emergency regarding a provider's facilities,
the village shall use best efforts to contact the provider or the system
representative of each provider affected, or potentially affected, by the
emergency. In any event, the village may take whatever action it deems
necessary in order to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be
borne by the provider whose facilities caused the emergency.
      (2)   Except in the case of an emergency, any provider who constructs in,
on, above, within, over, below or through a rights-of-way without a valid
permit must subsequently obtain a permit, pay double the normal fee for said
permit, pay double all the other fees required by the code, deposit with the
village the fees necessary to correct any damage to the rights-of-way and
comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
   (E)   Revocation of permits.
      (1)   Permittees hold permits issued pursuant to the code as a privilege
and not as a right. The village reserves its right, as provided herein, to
revoke any permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a substantial
breach of the terms and conditions of any law, or any provision or condition of
the permit. A substantial breach by permittee shall include, but shall not be
limited to, the following:
         (a)   The violation of any provision or condition of the permit; or
         (b)   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the village or its citizens; or
         (c)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
permit; or
         (d)   The failure to maintain the required construction or removal
bonds and/or insurance; or
         (e)   The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a
certificate of registration; or
         (f)   The failure to complete the construction in a timely manner; or
         (g)   The failure to correct a condition of an order issued pursuant

   (A)   Construction bond. Prior to the commencement of any construction, a
construction permittee, excluding the village and Hamilton County, shall
deposit with the village an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit and/or
surety bond in an amount determined by the Mayor to be appropriate based upon
fair and reasonable criteria. Unless a construction default, problem or
deficiency involves an emergency or endangers the safety of the general public,
the village shall serve written notice to the construction permittee detailing
the construction default, problem or deficiency. If the village determines that
correction or repair of the construction default, problem or deficiency has not
occurred or has not been substantially initiated within ten calendar days after
the date following service and notification and detailing the construction
default, problem or deficiency, then the village may attach the letter of
credit or surety bond. Upon attachment, written notice shall be served on the
construction permittee by the village.
   (B)   Removal bond. Upon issuance of a certificate of registration and
continuously thereafter, and until 120 days after a provider's facilities have
been removed from the rights-of-way, (unless the village notifies the provider
that a reasonably longer period shall apply), a provider shall deposit with the
village and maintain an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit or surety
bond in an amount equal to or greater than $100,000, the village shall make all
reasonable efforts to allow provider a period of five calendar days after
serving notification in writing to correct or repair any default, problem or
deficiency prior to the village attachment of the letter of credit or surety
bond regarding the removal of facilities. Upon attachment, written notice shall
be provided to the provider by the village.
   (C)   Blanket bond. In lieu of the construction bond required by division
(A) of this section and the removal bond required by division (B) of this
section, provider may deposit with the village an irrevocable, unconditional
letter of credit and/or surety bond in the amount of $5,000,000. Unless a
construction default, problem or deficiency involves an emergency or endangers
the safety of the general public, the village shall make all reasonable effort
to allow permittee a period of five calendar days after sending notification in
writing to correct or repair any default, problem or deficiency prior to
village's attachment of the letter of credit or surety bond.

and the blanket bond required by division (C) of this section, those providers
maintaining a book value in excess of $50,000,000 may submit a statement to the
village requesting to self-bond. If approval to self-bond is granted, a
provider shall assure the village that such self-bonding shall provide the
village with no less protection and security than would have been afforded to
the village by a third party surety providing provider with the types and
amounts of bonds detailed in the above named sections. This statement shall
include:
      (1)   Audited financial statements for the previous year; and
      (2)   A description of the applicant's self-bonding program.
      (3)   Other applicable and pertinent information as reasonably requested
by the village.
   (E)   Purposes. The bonds required by this section, and any self-bonding to
the extent it has been permitted, shall serve as security for:

by the permittee or provider's violation of this chapter or its failure to
comply with all rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the
village issued pursuant to this chapter; and
      (3)   The payment of all compensation due to the village, including
permit fees; and
      (4)   The payment of premiums (if any) for the liability insurance
required pursuant to this chapter; and
      (5)   The removal of facilities from the rights-of-way pursuant to this
chapter; and
      (6)   The payment to the village of any amounts for which the permittee
or provider is liable that are not paid by its insurance or other surety; and

surety nor the intention to cancel or not to renew be stated by the surety
until 90 days after completion of construction of the facilities and,
notwithstanding the foregoing, shall in no case be canceled or not renewed by
the surety until at least 90 days' written notice to village of surety's
intention to cancel or not renew this bond.

operation of its facilities, or out of any activity undertaken in or near a

suit or other proceeding claiming damages, or seeking any other relief against

subcontractors for any claim nor for any award arising out of the presence,
installation, maintenance or operation of its facilities, or any activity
undertaken in or near a rights-of-way, whether the act or omission complained
of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by a permit. This section is not, as to
third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the
provider, permittee or to the village; and the provider or permittee, in
defending any action on behalf of the village, shall be entitled to assert in
any action every defense or immunity that the village could assert in its own
behalf. Any and all exercise of the above shall be consistent with, but not
limited to, the following:

hold harmless the village, its elected officials, agents, officers, employees,
volunteers and subcontractors from and against any and all lawsuits, claims
(including without limitation worker's compensation claims against the village
or others), causes of actions, actions, liability, and judgments for injury or
damages (including, but not limited to, expenses for reasonable legal fees,
costs and expenses assumed by the village in connection therewith); and
            1.   Persons or property, in any way arising out of or through the
acts or omissions of provider or permittee, its subcontractors, agents or
employees attributable to the occupation by the provider or permittee of the
rights- of-way, to which provider's or permittee's negligence shall in any way
contribute, and regardless of whether the village's negligence or the
negligence of any other party shall have contributed to such claim, cause of
action, judgment, injury or damage; and
            2.   Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy,
for defamation of person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement
of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or any other
right of any person, firm and corporation by the provider, but excluding claims
arising out of or related to the village's actions; and
            3.   Arising out of provider or permittee's failure to comply with
the provisions of law applicable to provider or permittee in its business
hereunder.
      (2)   The foregoing indemnification is conditioned upon the village:
         (a)   Giving provider or permittee prompt notice of any claim or the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is
sought; and

the provider or permittee all pertinent information under the village's
control.

thereof, and the provider or permittee shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such separate counsel if employed.

all defaults thereunder; and

any certificate of registration or permit shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with the substantive laws of the village, State of Ohio and United
States, in that order. As a condition of the grant of any permit or issuance of
any certificate of registration, unless otherwise required by law, all disputes
shall be resolved in a court of competent jurisdiction in Hamilton County,
Ohio.
   (F)   Force majeure. In the event any person's performance of any of the
terms, conditions or obligations required by this chapter is prevented by a

permittee continues to operate all or any part of the facilities after the
termination, lapse, or revocation of a certificate of registration, such

operation, provided that any such continued operation shall in no way be
construed as a renewal or other extension of the certificate of registration,
nor as a limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the village as a
result of such continued operation after the term, including, but not limited
to, damages and restitution. Any conflict between the issuance of a certificate
of registration or of a permit and any other present or future lawful exercise
of the village's regulatory or police powers shall be resolved in favor of the
latter.

§ 70.10 THROUGH HIGHWAYS.
   (A)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (B)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (C)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (D)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

   (A)   Steady green signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
is permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic-control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u- turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u- turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         (a)   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         (b)   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   (a)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic-control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (B)   Steady yellow signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic-control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in this division (C)(1) and
divisions (C)(2) and (C)(3) above.
         (b)   Except when a traffic-control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic-control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic-control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one- way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic-control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.

has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (E)   Flashing yellow signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u- turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic-control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right- of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic-control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic-
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic-control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right- of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic-control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic-control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic-control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (H)   This section does not apply at railroad grade- crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

§ 70.32 SIGNALS OVER REVERSIBLE LANES.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (A)   A steady downward green arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (B)   A steady yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (C)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (D)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (E)   A steady red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

is controlled by traffic control signals shall do all of the following if the
signal facing the driver exhibits no colored lights or colored lighted arrows,
exhibits a combination of such lights or arrows that fails to clearly indicate
the assignment of right-of-way, or, if the vehicle is a bicycle or an electric
bicycle, the signals are otherwise malfunctioning due to the failure of a
vehicle detector to detect the presence of the bicycle or electric bicycle:
      (1)   Stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, stop before
entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none, stop
before entering the intersection;
      (2)   Yield the right-of-way to all vehicles in the intersection or
approaching on an intersecting road, if the vehicles will constitute an
immediate hazard during the time the driver is moving across or within the
intersection or junction of roadways;

vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.

walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic-control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.

or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in

      (2)   The period of denial shall be five years after the date the order
is issued, unless, during that five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of
the offense that resulted in the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies
the Registrar of the termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and
notifies the Registrar, the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to
permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer the registration of the vehicle.
   (F)   This section does not apply to motor vehicle rental dealers or motor
vehicle leasing dealers, as defined in R.C. § 4549.65.

   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. § 4510.07 or in any other
provision of the Ohio Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or
pleads guilty to a violation of any provision of this code that is
substantially equivalent to a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, and a court
is permitted or required to suspend a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to
any other penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or non resident operating privileges for
the period of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of
suspension imposed for the violation of the provision of this code shall not
exceed the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for
the violation of the provision of the Ohio Revised Code to which the provision
of this code is substantially equivalent.
(R.C. § 4510.05)
   (B)   Whenever a person is found guilty under the laws of this state or any
ordinance of any political subdivision of this state, of operating a motor
vehicle in violation of any such law or ordinance relating to reckless
operation, the trial court of any court of record, in addition to or
independent of all other penalties provided by law, may impose a class five

license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver’s
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under R.C. Ch. 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license on or
about the person’s person shall be prima facie evidence of the person’s not
having obtained a driver’s license.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) below, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to §

section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under R.C. § 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order from
the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar shall
accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any
motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
Registrar of the termination. The Registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a non-
certified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the

alleged violation of division (B)(1) above. The person charged with a violation
of division (B)(1) above may offer evidence to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (B)(1) above is guilty of driving under

   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver's or commercial driver's license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a non-
certified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of divisions (A)(1) or (A)(2) above may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid driver’s or
commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of division
(A)(1) above or a valid license as a motorcycle operator either in the form of
an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s license or a restricted

to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.

carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the

shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action as
evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But, the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the State Rules of
Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action
and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents non-
economic loss, as defined in R.C. § 2307.011, in a tort action that could have
been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that

not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

         (b)   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;

admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         (b)   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of divisions (A) or
(B) above or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the court may
admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled
substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination of them in
the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine, or other
bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by chemical
analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of the
alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

TECHNICIAN-INTERMEDIATE and EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN- PARAMEDIC have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (A)(1)(b), (A)(1)
(c), (A)(1)(d) and (A)(1)(e) above or less than the applicable concentration of
a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
specified for a violation of division (A)(1)(j) above, that fact may be
considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence
of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution
for a violation of division (B) above.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (D)(1)(b) above, the person tested may
have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical test or tests,
at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the request of a
law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as described in R.C. §
4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of
the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken at the
person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest other than described in
R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under §
73.02, shall state that the person may have an independent test performed at
the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical
test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the
chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   (a)   As used in divisions (D)(4)(b) and (D)(4)(c) below, NATIONAL
HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION means the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration established as an administration of the United States Department
of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. § 105.
         (b)   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of divisions (A) or (B) above, of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or
alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to operating
a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance,
or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has administered a field
sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in the violation and if
it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the officer administered the
test in substantial compliance with the testing standards for any reliable,
credible, and generally accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at
the time the tests were administered, including but not limited to any testing
standards then in effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.

admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         (c)   Division (D)(4)(b) above does not limit or preclude a court, in
its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by probable
cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal prosecution or
juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division, from
considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by division
(D)(4)(b) of this section.
   (E)   (1)   Subject to division (E)(3) below, in any criminal prosecution or
juvenile court proceeding for a violation of divisions (A)(1)(b), (A)(1)(c),
(A)(1)(d), (A)(1)(e), (A)(1)(f), (A)(1)(g), (A)(1)(h), (A)(1)(i), or (A)(1)(j)

training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (E)(1) above is not
admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding, other
than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the prosecutor
has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if the
defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (E)(1) above shall not
be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any substance
if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains or the
defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (F)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical

limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under R.C. §§ 4510.021
and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition
interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of
suspension as authorized under R.C. § 4510.022. If the court grants unlimited

imposed under division (H)(1) of this section as required under that section.
      (2)   If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one or more violations of division (A)
of this section or other equivalent offenses, the offender is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree. In addition to any other sanction imposed for

loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate
result of the offender's operation of the vehicle before, during, or after
committing the violation of division (B) of this section.
   (I)   (1)   No court shall sentence an offender to an alcohol treatment
program under this section unless the treatment program complies with the

the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services.
      (2)   An offender who stays in a drivers’ intervention program or in an
alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program; however, if the court determines that an
offender who stays in an alcohol treatment program under an order issued under
this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court’s Indigent Drivers’ Alcohol
Treatment Fund.
   (J)   If a person whose driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended under this section or R.C. §
4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of the person’s trial or sentence,
the appeal itself does not stay the operation of the suspension.
   (K)   Division (A)(1)(j) above does not apply to a person who operates a
vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the amount specified in

as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited concentration of
alcohol.
   (M)   All terms defined in R.C. § 4510.01 apply to this section. If the
meaning of a term defined in R.C. § 4510.01 conflicts with the meaning of the

person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
   (B)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, the arresting

give that advice in a written form that contains the information described in
division (C) of this section and shall read the advice to the person. The form
shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest
and read to the person by the arresting officer. One or more persons shall
witness the arresting officer’s reading of the form, and the witnesses shall
certify to this fact by signing the form. The person must submit to the
chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the arresting officer,
within two hours of the time of the alleged violation and, if the person does
not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour time limit, the failure to
submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, if a person is
under arrest as described in division (B) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the

substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the following form
to the person:

law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
      If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state OVI, and, if
you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
      (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
      If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.
   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in division (B) of this section or division (A)(5) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately forward it
to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the
arrested person is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is
not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it
to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after
the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the
license or permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge.
Upon receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (B) of this section
to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, if
the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of the
consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of §
73.03, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
person submits to the test or tests and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting officer
shall do all of the following:
         (a)   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         (c)   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
         (d)   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for being
in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or

the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the form
described in division (C) of this section;
            4.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
            5.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (A)(5)
of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time

blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
   (F)   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but

unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn

   (A)   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a
vehicle and its load is unlawful may require the driver of the vehicle to stop
and submit to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable,
sealed scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways; a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
highway vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location,
having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined
load of all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway
vehicle; or a sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or
unloaded.
   (B)   The driver of the vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed
to the nearest available sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided the
scales are within three miles of the point where the vehicle is stopped.
   (C)   Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the
police officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as
prescribed by this section.
   (D)   All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and its
load shall be annually compared by a municipal, county or state sealer with the
state standards or standards approved by the state, and the scales shall not be
sealed if they do not conform to the state standards or standards approved by
the state.
   (E)   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a
straight approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and
width to ensure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, they shall always be used on a level terrain of sufficient length and
width to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. Such terrain shall be
level, or if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in
elevation between the wheels on any one axle does not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed one-quarter
inch per foot of the distance between such axles.
   (F)   In all determinations of all weights, except gross weight, by compact,
self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the
wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, 12 feet or less
apart, shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one such scale under the
outside wheel of each such axle. In determinations of gross weight by the use
of compact, self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to
determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be weighed
simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside wheel of each axle.
   (G)   Whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that
the weight is unlawful, he or she may require the driver to stop the vehicle in
a suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed
as is necessary to reduce the weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted
under R.C. §§ 5577.01 through 5577.14 and this chapter.

herein defined. For the purpose of this section, FRONT YARD shall mean that

conform to any provision of this section, or fail to obey any lawful order of
an officer charged with its enforcement. Each and every day on which any person
continues to violate the provisions of this section, after having been notified
of the violation, shall constitute a separate offense. This conviction shall
not relieve any person from thereafter complying with the provisions of the
section, and shall be sufficient cause for the Building Commissioner to refuse
further building permits to the offender until such time as the orders have
been complied with.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section shall be fined an amount not to exceed
$100 and court costs.

suspend the horse-drawn carriage’s license. In such a circumstance the Mayor
shall immediately notify the license holder who shall discontinue operation of
the horse-drawn carriage at once.
      (2)   Upon notifying the license holder of the emergency suspension, the
Mayor shall set a time and place for a hearing to determine if the suspension

   (A)   Animals running at large.
      (1)   (a)   Any person who is the owner or has charge of any animal shall
not permit it to run at large in the public road, highway, street, lane, or
alley, or upon unenclosed land, or permit them to go upon any private yard,
lot, or enclosure. Any such time that a dog is not in an enclosed and secured
area on its owner’s property, it shall be under positive leash control of the
owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog.
         (b)   Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in division (A)(1)(a)
above, an owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog may allow the dog to run off
leash at Ann Buntin Becker Park, Dogwood Bell Tower Park, the green space on
the south side of Miami Bluff Drive between 6812 Miami Bluff and 6973 Miami
Bluff, including the Mariemont Concourse, the lower 80 acres, the grassy
boulevard between Hiawatha Avenue and Rembold Avenue, and the practice field at
Waldorf School; provided, that the dogs must be under positive leash control
while in the Tot Lot area of Dogwood Park as well as at all times in the sports
field area of Dogwood Park and the practice field by Waldorf School during
sporting activities.
         (c)   This division (A)(1) shall go into effect at the earliest date
allowed by law.
      (2)   No person shall cause animals to be herded, kept, or detained for
the purpose of grazing on premises other than those owned or occupied by the
owner or keeper thereof without the consent of the owner of the premises.
      (3)   The running at large of such animal in or upon any of the places
mentioned in divisions (A)(1) and (A)(2) above is prima facie evidence that it
is running at large in violation of this section.
(R.C. §§ 951.01, 951.02)
      (4)   Whoever violates this division (A) is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the fourth degree.
(R.C. § 951.99)
      (5)   The owner or keeper of an animal described herein who permits it to
run at large in violation of this section, is liable for all damages caused by
such animal upon the premises of another without reference to the fence which
may enclose such premises.
(R.C. § 951.10)
   (B)   Dogs running at large; dangerous or vicious dogs; debarked or
surgically silenced vicious dogs.
      (1)   As used in this section, DANGEROUS DOG and VICIOUS DOG have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.
      (2)   No owner, keeper, or harborer of any female dog shall permit it to

in heat unless the dog is properly in leash.
      (3)   Except when a dog is lawfully engaged in hunting and accompanied by
the owner, keeper, harborer, or handler of the dog, no owner, keeper, or
harborer of any dog shall fail at any time to do either of the following:
         (a)   Keep the dog physically confined or restrained upon the premises
of the owner, keeper, or harborer by a leash, tether, adequate fence,
supervision, or secure enclosure to prevent escape; or
         (b)   Keep the dog under the reasonable control of some person.
      (4)   Except when a dangerous or vicious dog is lawfully engaged in
hunting or training for the purpose of hunting and is accompanied by the owner,
keeper, harborer, or handler of the dog, no owner, keeper, or harborer of a
dangerous or vicious dog shall fail to do either of the following:
         (a)   While the dog is on the premises of the owner, keeper, or
harborer, securely confine it at all times in a locked pen that has a top or
other locked enclosure that has a top while the dog is unattended. If the dog
is attended while in its locked yard, the person so attending said dog must be
physically able to control the dog while it is in a locked and fenced yard and
must keep the dog on a leash at all times to ensure that the dog cannot escape
from the yard; or
         (b)   While the dog is off the premises of the owner, keeper, or
harborer, keep that dog on a chain-link leash or tether that is not more than
six feet in length and additionally do the following: keep the dog in a locked
pen that has a top, locked fenced yard, or other locked enclosure that has a
top; have the leash or tether controlled by a person who is of suitable age and
discretion or securely attach, tie, or affix the leash or tether to the ground
or a stationary object or fixture so that the dog is adequately restrained and
station a person in close enough proximity to that dog so as to prevent it from
causing injury to any person; and to muzzle that dog.
      (5)   No owner, keeper, or harborer of a vicious dog shall fail to obtain
liability insurance with an insurer authorized to write liability insurance in
this state providing coverage in each occurrence, subject to a limit, exclusive
of interest and costs, of not less than $300,000 because of damage or bodily
injury to or death of a person caused by the vicious dog. Each owner, keeper,
or harborer of a vicious dog shall be required to submit proof of insurance
upon the request of a law enforcement official. Failure to provide said proof
of insurance shall result in the immediate confinement of the dog, at the
owner, keeper or harborer’s expense, until such insurance coverage is shown.
      (6)   No person shall do any of the following:
         (a)   Debark or surgically silence a dog that the person knows or has
reason to believe is a vicious dog;

believe that the dog has been debarked or surgically silenced; or
         (c)   Falsely attest on a waiver form provided by the veterinarian
under division (B)(7) below that the person’s dog is not a vicious dog or
otherwise provide false information on that written waiver form.
      (7)   (a)   Before a veterinarian debarks or surgically silences a dog,
the veterinarian may give the owner of the dog a written waiver form that
attests that the dog is not a vicious dog.
         (b)   The written waiver form shall include all of the following:
            1.   The veterinarian’s license number and current business
address;
            2.   The number of the license of the dog if the dog is licensed;
            3.   A reasonable description of the age, coloring, and gender of
the dog as well as any notable markings on the dog;
            4.   The signature of the owner of the dog attesting that the
owner’s dog is not a vicious dog;
            5.   A statement that division (F) of R.C. § 955.22 prohibits any
person from doing any of the following:
               a.   Debarking or surgically silencing a dog that the person
knows or has reason to believe is a vicious dog;
               b.   Possessing a vicious dog if the person knows or has reason
to believe that the dog has been debarked or surgically silenced; or
               c.   Falsely attesting on a waiver form provided by the
veterinarian under division (G) of R.C. § 955.22 that the person’s dog is not a
vicious dog or otherwise provide false information on that written waiver form.
      (8)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge of a violation of division
(B)(6) above that the veterinarian, who is charged with the violation obtained,
prior to debarking or surgically silencing the dog, a written waiver form that
complies with division (B)(7) above and that attests that the dog is not a
vicious dog.
(R.C. § 955.22)
   (C)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates divisions (B)(2) or (B)(3) above shall be fined

offender owns, keeps, or harbors, to cause that dog to complete dog obedience
training, or to do both.
      (3)   If a violation of division (B)(4) or (B)(5) above involves a
dangerous or vicious dog, whoever violates divisions (B)(4) or (B)(5) above is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree on a first offense and of a
misdemeanor of the first degree on each subsequent offense. Additionally, the

the responsibility of the owner, keeper, or harborer. Additionally, the court
may order the offender to personally supervise the dangerous dog that the
offender owns, keeps, or harbors, to cause that dog to complete dog obedience
training, or to do both, and the court shall order the offender to obtain
liability insurance pursuant to division (B)(5) above. In the alternative, the
court may order the dangerous and/or vicious dog to be humanely destroyed by a
licensed veterinarian, the County Dog Warden, or the County Humane Society.

or (b) of the definition for “transaction scan” in this section.
      (2)   If the information deciphered by the transaction scan performed
under division (B)(1) of this section fails to match the information printed on
the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or identification card presented by
the card holder, or if the transaction scan indicates that the information so
printed is false or fraudulent, neither the permit holder nor any agent or
employee of the permit holder shall sell any beer, intoxicating liquor, or low-
alcohol beverage to the card holder.
      (3)   Division (B)(1) of this section does not preclude a permit holder
or an agent or employee of a permit holder from using a transaction scan device
to check the validity of a document other than a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or identification card, if the document includes a bar code or
magnetic strip that may be scanned by the device, as a condition of a sale
beer, intoxicating liquor, or a low-alcohol beverage or of granting admission
to a premises described in the definition for “transaction scan” in this
section.
   (C)   The Registrar of Motor Vehicles, with the approval of the Liquor
Control Commission, shall adopt, and may amend or rescind, rules in accordance
with R.C. Chapter 119 that do both of the following:
      (1)   Govern the recording and maintenance of information described in
R.C. § 4301.61(D)(1)(a) and (D)(1)(b), R.C. § 2925.57(D)(1)(a) and (D)(1)(b),
and R.C. § 2927.021(D)(1)(a) and (D)(1)(b);
      (2)   Ensure quality control in the use of transaction scan devices under
R.C. §§ 2925.57, 2925.58, 2927.021, 2927.022, 4301.61, and 4301.611.
   (D)   (1)   No permit holder or agent or employee of a permit holder shall
electronically or mechanically record or maintain any information derived from
a transaction scan, except for the following:
         (a)   The name and date of birth of the person listed on the driver’s
or commercial driver’s license or identification card presented by the card
holder;
         (b)   The expiration date and identification number of the driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or identification card presented by the card
holder.
      (2)   No permit holder or agent or employee of a permit holder shall use
the information that is derived from a transaction scan or that is permitted to
be recorded and maintained under division (D)(1) of this section, except for
purposes of R.C. § 4301.611, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (3)   No permit holder or agent or employee of a permit holder shall use
a transaction scan device for a purpose other than a purpose listed in
divisions (a) or (b) of the definition for “transaction scan” in this section.
      (4)   No permit holder or agent or employee of a permit holder shall sell
or otherwise disseminate the information derived from a transaction scan to any
third party, including but not limited to selling or otherwise disseminating
that information for any marketing, advertising, or promotional activities, but
a seller or agent or employee of a seller may release that information pursuant
to a court order or as specifically authorized by R.C. § 4301.611, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or another section of this code
or the Ohio Revised Code.
   (E)   Nothing in this section or R.C. § 4301.611, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, relieves a permit holder or an agent or
employee of a permit holder of any responsibility to comply with any other
applicable local, state or federal laws or rules governing the sale of beer,
intoxicating liquor, or low-alcohol beverages.
   (F)   Whoever violates division (B)(2) or (D) of this section is guilty of
an illegal liquor transaction scan, and the court may impose upon the offender
a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each violation. The Clerk of the Court
shall pay each collected civil penalty to the County Treasurer for deposit into
the County Treasury.
(R.C. § 4301.61) (2000 Code, § 92.28)
§ 92.29 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES.
   (A)   A permit holder or an agent or employee of a permit holder may not be
found guilty of a charge of a violation of this chapter or any rule of the
Liquor Control Commission in which the age of the purchaser of any beer,
intoxicating liquor, or low-alcohol beverage is an element of the alleged
violation, if the permit holder, agent, or employee raises and proves as an
affirmative defense that all of the following occurred:
      (1)   A card holder attempting to purchase any beer, intoxicating liquor,
or low-alcohol beverage presented a driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
an identification card;
      (2)   A transaction scan of the driver’s or commercial driver’s license
or identification card that the card holder presented indicated that the
license or card was valid; and
      (3)   The beer, intoxicating liquor, or low- alcohol beverage was sold to
the card holder in reasonable reliance upon the identification presented and
the completed transaction scan.
   (B)   (1)   In determining whether a permit holder or an agent or employee
of a permit holder has proven the affirmative defense provided by division (A)
above, the Liquor Control Commission or the trier of fact in a court of record
shall consider any written policy that the permit holder has adopted and
implemented and that is intended to prevent violations of R.C. §§ 4301.22(A)(1)
or (A)(2), 4301.63 to 4301.636, 4301.69, and 4301.691, or any substantially
similar municipal ordinances.
      (2)   For purposes of division (A)(3) above, the Commission or trier of
fact shall consider that reasonable reliance upon the identification presented
and the completed transaction scan may require a permit holder or an agent or
employee of a permit holder to exercise reasonable diligence to determine, and
that the use of a transaction scan device does not excuse a permit holder or an
agent or employee of a permit holder from exercising reasonable diligence to
determine, the following:
         (a)   Whether a person to whom the permit holder or agent or employee
of a permit holder sells any beer or intoxicating liquor is 21 years of age or
older or sells low-alcohol beverage is 18 years of age or older; or
         (b)   Whether the description and picture appearing on the driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or identification card presented by a card holder
is that of the card holder.
   (C)   The affirmative defense provided by division (A) above is in addition
to the defense provided by R.C. § 4301.639, or any substantially similar
municipal ordinance.
   (D)   In any hearing before the Liquor Control Commission and in any
criminal action in which the affirmative defense provided by division (A) above
is raised, the Registrar of Motor Vehicles or a deputy registrar who issued an
identification card under R.C. §§ 4507.50 to 4507.52 shall be permitted to
submit certified copies of the records of that issuance in lieu of the
testimony of the personnel of or contractors with the Bureau of Motor Vehicles
in the hearing or action.
(R.C. § 4301.611) (2000 Code, § 92.29)
§ 92.99 PENALTY.

has been provided is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

§ 93.005 COLLECTION OF COST OF ABATING DANGEROUS PROPERTY CONDITION;
INJUNCTION; REHABILITATION.
   (A)   Collection of costs of abating dangerous property conditions.
      (1)   As used in this division (A):
         ABATEMENT ACTIVITY. Each instance of any of the following:
            1.   Removing, repairing, or securing insecure, unsafe,
structurally defective, abandoned, deserted, or open and vacant buildings or
other structures;
            2.   Making emergency corrections of hazardous conditions; or
            3.   Abatement of any nuisance by the municipality or its agent
pursuant to division (A)(5) below.
         TOTAL COST. Any costs incurred due to the use of employees, materials,
or equipment of the municipality or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5)
below, any costs arising out of contracts for labor, materials, or equipment,
and costs of service of notice or publication required under this section.
      (2)   The municipality or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5) below may
collect the total cost of abatement activities by any of the methods prescribed
in divisions (A)(2)(a), (A)(2)(b), or (A)(2)(c) below.
         (a)   For each abatement activity in which costs are incurred, the
Clerk of the legislative authority of the municipality or its agent pursuant to
division (A)(5) below may certify the total costs of each abatement activity,
together with the parcel number or another proper description of the lands on
which the abatement activity occurred, the date the costs were incurred for
each abatement activity, and the name of the owner of record at the time the
costs were incurred for each abatement activity, to the County Auditor who
shall place the costs as a charge upon the tax list and duplicate. The costs
are a lien upon such lands from and after the date the costs were incurred. The
costs shall be collected as other taxes and returned to the municipality or its
agent pursuant to division (A)(5) below, as directed by the Clerk of the
legislative authority in the certification of the total costs or in an
affidavit from the agent delivered to the County Auditor or County Treasurer.
The placement of the costs on the tax list and duplicate relates back to, and
is effective in priority, as of the date the costs were incurred; provided,
that the municipality or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5) below certifies
the total costs within one year from the date the costs were incurred. If a
lien placed on a parcel of land pursuant to this division (A)(2) is
extinguished as provided in division (A)(8) below, the municipality may pursue
the remedy available under division (A)(2)(b) below to recoup the costs
incurred with respect to that parcel from any person that held title to the
parcel at the time the costs were incurred.
         (b)   The municipality or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5) below
may commence a civil action to recover the total costs from the person that
held title to the parcel at the time the costs were incurred.
         (c)   The municipality or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5) below
may file a lien on a parcel of land for the total costs incurred under this
section with respect to the parcel by filing a written affidavit with the
County Recorder of the county in which the parcel is located that states the
parcel number, the total costs incurred with respect to the parcel, and the
date such costs were incurred. The municipality or its agent may pursue a
foreclosure action to enforce the lien in a court of competent jurisdiction or,
pursuant to R.C. §§ 323.65 to 323.79, with the Board of Revision. The
municipality or its agent may elect to acquire the parcel by indicating such an
election in the complaint for foreclosure or in an amended complaint. Upon the
entry of a decree of foreclosure, the County Sheriff shall advertise and offer
the property for sale on at least one occasion. The minimum bid with regard to
the sale of the foreclosed property shall equal the sum of the taxes,
penalties, interest, costs, and assessments due and payable on the property,
the total costs incurred by the municipality or its agent with respect to the
property, and any associated court costs and interest as authorized by law. An
owner of the property may redeem the property by paying the minimum bid within
ten days after the entry of the decree of foreclosure. If an owner fails to so
redeem the property, and if the parcel is not sold for want of a minimum bid,
the property shall be disposed of as follows:
            1.   If the municipality or its agent elects to acquire the
property, the parcel shall be transferred to the municipality or its agent as
if the property were transferred by all owners in title to the municipality or
its agent in lieu of foreclosure as provided in R.C. § 5722.10;
            2.   If the municipality or its agent does not elect to acquire the
property, the parcel shall be forfeited to the state or to a political
subdivision or school district as provided in R.C. Ch. 5723; or
            3.   When the municipality or its agent acquires property as
provided in this division (A)(2)(c), the property shall not be subject to
foreclosure or forfeiture under R.C. § 323.25 or R.C. Ch. 5721 or 5723, and any
lien on the property for costs incurred under this division (A) or for any
unpaid taxes, penalties, interest, charges, or assessments shall be
extinguished.
      (3)   This division (A) applies to any action taken by the municipality
or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5) below pursuant to R.C. § 715.26 or
pursuant to § 3 of Art. XVIII, State Constitution.
      (4)   (a)   The municipality or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5)
below shall not certify to the County Auditor for placement upon the tax list
and duplicate and the County Auditor shall not place upon the tax list and
duplicate as a charge against the land the costs of any abatement activity
undertaken under division (A)(2) below if any of the following apply:
            1.   The abatement activity occurred on land that has been
transferred or sold to an electing subdivision as defined in R.C. § 5722.01,
regardless of whether the electing subdivision is still the owner of the land,
and the abatement activity occurred on a date prior to the transfer or
confirmation of sale to the electing subdivision;
            2.   The abatement activity occurred on land that has been sold to
a purchaser at sheriff’s sale or auditor’s sale, the abatement activity
occurred on a date prior to the confirmation of sale, and the purchaser is not
the owner of record of the land immediately prior to the judgment of
foreclosure nor any of the following:
               a.   A member of that owner’s immediate family;
               b.   A person with a power of attorney appointed by that owner
who subsequently transfers the land to the owner;
               c.   A sole proprietorship owned by that owner or a member of
that owner’s immediate family; or
               d.   A partnership, trust, business trust, corporation, or
association of which the owner or a member of the owner’s immediate family owns
or controls directly or indirectly more than 50%.
            3.   The abatement activity is taken on land that has been
forfeited to this state for delinquent taxes, unless the owner of record
redeems the land.
         (b)   Upon valid written notice to the County Auditor by any owner
possessing an ownership interest of record of the land or by an electing
subdivision previously in the chain of title of the land that the costs of an
abatement activity undertaken under division (A)(2) above was certified for
placement or placed upon the tax list and duplicate as a charge against the
land in violation of this division (A)(4), the County Auditor shall promptly
remove such charge from the tax duplicate. This written notice to the County
Auditor shall include all of the following:
            1.   The parcel number of the land;
            2.   The common address of the land;
            3.   The date of the recording of the transfer of the land to the
owner or electing subdivision; or
            4.   The charge allegedly placed in violation of this division (A)
(4).
      (5)   The municipality may enter into an agreement with a County Land
Reutilization Corporation organized under R.C. Ch. 1724 wherein the County Land
Reutilization Corporation agrees to act as the agent of the municipality in
connection with removing, repairing, or securing insecure, unsafe, structurally
defective, abandoned, deserted, or open and vacant buildings or other
structures, making emergency corrections of hazardous conditions, or abating
any nuisance, including high weeds, overgrown brush, and trash and debris from
vacant lots. The total costs of such actions may be collected by the
corporation pursuant to division (A)(2) above, and shall be paid to the
corporation if it paid or incurred such costs and has not been reimbursed by
the owner of record at the time of the action or any other party with a
recorded interest in the land.
      (6)   In the case of the lien of a County Land Reutilization Corporation
that is the agent of the municipality, a notation shall be placed on the tax
list and duplicate showing the amount of the lien ascribed specifically to the
agent’s total costs. The agent has standing to pursue a separate cause of
action for money damages to satisfy the lien or pursue a foreclosure action in
a court of competent jurisdiction or with the Board of Revision to enforce the
lien without regard to occupancy. For purposes of a foreclosure proceeding by
the County Treasurer for delinquent taxes, this division (A)(6) does not affect
the lien priority as between a County Land Reutilization Corporation and the
County Treasurer, but the corporation’s lien is superior to the lien of any
other lienholder of the property. As to a direct action by a County Land
Reutilization Corporation, the lien for the taxes, assessment, charges, costs,
penalties, and interest on the tax list and duplicate is in all cases superior
to the lien of a County Land Reutilization Corporation, whose lien for total
costs shall be next in priority as against all other interests, except as
provided in division (A)(7) below.
      (7)   A County Land Reutilization Corporation acting as an agent of the
municipality under an agreement under this division (A) may, with the County
Treasurer’s consent, petition the court or Board of Revision with jurisdiction
over an action undertaken under division (A)(6) above pleading that the lien of
the corporation, as agent, for the total costs shall be superior to the lien
for the taxes, assessments, charges, costs, penalties, and interest. If the
court or Board of Revision determines that the lien is for total costs paid or
incurred by the corporation as such an agent, and that subordinating the lien
for such taxes and other impositions to the lien of the corporation promotes
the expeditious abatement of public nuisances, the court or board may order the
lien for the taxes and other impositions to be subordinate to the corporation’s
lien. The court or board may not subordinate the lien for taxes and other such
impositions to any other liens.
      (8)   (a)   When a parcel of land upon which a lien has been placed under
divisions (A)(2)(a) or (A)(2)(c) above is transferred to a County Land
Reutilization Corporation, the lien on the parcel shall be extinguished if the
lien is for costs or charges that were incurred before the date of the transfer
to the corporation and if the corporation did not incur the costs or charges,
regardless of whether the lien was attached or the costs or charges were
certified before the date of transfer. In such a case, the County Land
Reutilization Corporation and its successors in title shall take title to the
property free and clear of any such lien and shall be immune from liability in
any action to collect such costs or charges.

§ 94.01 IMPOUNDING MOTOR VEHICLE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY; REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation, upon complaint of any person adversely affected, may order into
storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or private
agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the chief
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (A)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to division (B) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle
only in accordance with division (D) of this section.
      (4)   As used in this section, PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY means private
property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a home,
residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than three
separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. The phrase
does not include any private property on which is located one or more
structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by two or more
persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in the structure
or structures.
   (B)   (1)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been
ordered into storage pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section arrives after
the motor vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual
removal from the property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator
oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (C)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that the chief orders
into storage pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section. The record shall
include an entry for each such motor vehicle that identifies the motor
vehicle's license number, make, model, and color, the location from which it
was removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the
person from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it
has been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief's order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under division (A)
(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.
   (D)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both of
the following:
         (a)   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 or, if the vehicle
was towed within a municipal corporation that has established fees for vehicle
removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees established by the
municipal corporation.
         (b)   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
R.C. § 4513.611.
      (3)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under division
(D)(1)(b) of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage under division (A)(1) of this section may retrieve any personal items
from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         (a)   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         (b)   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
      (4)   For purposes of division (D)(3) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (5)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
division (A)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for 30 days, the
procedures established by R.C. §§ 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (E)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor
vehicle from any private residential or private agricultural property other
than in accordance with division (A)(1) of this section or R.C. §§ 4513.61 to
4513.65.
      (2)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with the
requirements of this section.
   (F)   This section does not apply to any private residential or private
agricultural property that is established as a private tow-away zone in
accordance with division (H) of this section or R.C. § 4513.601.
   (G)   Whoever violates division (E) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 4513.60)
   (H)   Private tow-away zones.
      (1)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away
zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         (a)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
            2.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.
If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow- away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

            4.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
            5.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may

            6.   In order to comply with the requirements of division (H)(1)(a)
of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the

established as a private tow- away zone in accordance with division (H)(1) of
this section, without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the
private property may cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The

The vehicle owner and the operator of the vehicle are considered to have
consented to the removal and storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the
applicable fees established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted

municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to division (H)(2) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
         (c)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
      (3)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (H)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow- away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
      (4)   (a)   Prior to towing a vehicle under division (H)(2) of this
section, a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many
photographs as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on
private property in violation of a private tow-away zone established under
division (H)(1) of this section. The towing service shall record the time and

printed form, for at least 30 days after the date on which the vehicle is
recovered by the owner or lienholder or at least two years after the date on
which the vehicle was towed, whichever is earlier.
         (b)   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under division
(H)(2) of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more
than two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone,
unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two
hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is
not within the power of the towing service.
      (5)   (a)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a

lienholder under this division shall ensure that such information is provided
in a timely manner.

   (A)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,

junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief's or trooper's duties; or

         (a)   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;

chief or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (C) of this section, the chief shall designate
the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (B)   If the chief or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
division (A) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle by
a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is

   (C)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity of
the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner's or lienholder's last

nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   (a)   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal

retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;

      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search

parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of any road or highway for 48 hours
or longer without notification to the chief of a law enforcement agency of the
municipal corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such
place.
      (2)   For purposes of this section, the fact that a motor vehicle has

   (B)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing of
the abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the municipality from the disposal of the vehicle.
(R.C. § 4513.64)
(2000 Code, § 95.05)
§ 94.06 JUNK MOTOR VEHICLE; ORDER TO COVER OR REMOVE; NOTICE; EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   (1)   As used in this section, JUNK MOTOR VEHICLE means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of §§
95.04(A)(2), (A)(3), (A)(4), and (A)(5) that is left uncovered in the open on
private property for more than 72 hours with the permission of the person
having the right to possession of the property, except if the person is
operating a junk yard or scrap metal processing facility licensed under the
authority of R.C. §§ 4737.05 through 4737.12, or otherwise regulated under
authority of a political subdivision; or if the property on which the motor
vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any governmental
authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of the property
can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide commercial
operation; or if the motor vehicle is a collector’s vehicle.
      (2)   The municipality shall not prevent a person from storing or
keeping, or restrict him or her in the method of storing or keeping, any
collector’s vehicle on private property with the permission of the person
having the right to the possession of the property, except that the
municipality may require a person having such permission to conceal, by means
of buildings, fences, vegetation, terrain, or other suitable obstruction, and
unlicensed collector’s vehicle stored in the open.
      (3)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal corporation,
a state highway patrol trooper, the Legislative Authority, or the zoning

the person having the right to the possession of the property on which a junk
motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk
motor vehicle either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other
suitable structure, or shall be removed from the property.
      (4)   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in
the open for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this
section. The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima facie evidence
of willful failure to comply with the notice, and each subsequent period of 30
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (B)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this chapter
that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable context
in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax and in

laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall control over the
use of the term in R.C. Title LVII.

plan.

§ 97.04 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (A)   Withholding provisions.
      (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in Mariemont shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying
wages earned and/or received by each employee in Mariemont. Except for
qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under §
97.03 or division (A)(2)(d) or (A)(2)(f) below, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in §
97.01(B), of 1.25%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall
deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the
employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays
the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the
employee.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) below, an employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax Administrator of
Mariemont the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld or the income
taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer according to the following schedule:
            1.   a.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be
remitted monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and
withheld or required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer on behalf of Mariemont in the preceding calendar year exceeded
$2,399, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of Mariemont in any month of the preceding
calendar quarter exceeded $200.
               b.   Payment under division (A)(2)(a)1. above shall be made so
that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days
after the last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
            2.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not
required to make payments under division (A)(2)(a)1. above of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end of each
calendar quarter.
         (b)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is
required to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal
taxes withheld on payments to employees under § 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. § 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made (if so determined by the Tax Administrator) by electronic
funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes deducted and withheld on
behalf of Mariemont. The payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this
division (A)(2)(b) does not affect an employer’s, agent’s, or other payer’s
obligation to file any return as required under this section.
         (c)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division (A)(2)(c) shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and Mariemont as the
return required of an nonresident employee whose sole income subject to the tax
under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee’s employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer.
         (d)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not
required to withhold Mariemont income tax with respect to an individual’s
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation’s successor entity.
         (e)   1.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer’s, agent’s, or other
payer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
            2.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to Mariemont the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
         (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
Mariemont income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
         (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for Mariemont until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
         (h)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
            1.   The names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for Mariemont during the preceding calendar year;
            2.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
            3.   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax
was withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the
preceding calendar year;
            4.   Any other information required for federal income tax
reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form
with respect to such employee; and
            5.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
         (i)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with
the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer’s or employee’s liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
         (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Mariemont income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer’s employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer’s control. For the purposes of this division
(A)(2)(j), a tip or gratuity is under the employer’s control if the tip or
gratuity is paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to
the employee, or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit
card, or other electronic means.
         (k)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee’s
qualifying wages subject to division (B)(2)(a)1. below among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales

more than 20 days of the services to complete the services; and
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to

this section;

         (b)   For the purposes of division (B)(2)(a) above, an employee shall
be considered to have spent a day performing services in Mariemont only if the
employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf of the employer
in Mariemont than in any other municipal corporation on that day. For the
purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a particular
location, the time spent performing one or more of the following activities
shall be considered to have been spent at the employee’s principal place of
work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first

            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee’s final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee’s
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (B)(2)(a) above shall apply only
if, with respect to the employee’s qualifying wages described in that division,
the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages to that
municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) below, if, during a
calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing personal
services in Mariemont exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer shall withhold
and remit tax to Mariemont for any subsequent days in that calendar year on

reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of Mariemont
for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time
for payment of taxes required by Mariemont during the period of the member’s or
civilian’s duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member’s or
civilian’s duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred and eight-first day after the
applicant’s active duty or service terminates. The Tax Administrator may
prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under this division (O)(1)
are not delinquent, and the Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
         (b)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to Mariemont before the one hundred and eight-first
day after the applicant’s active duty or service terminates.
         (c)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (N)(2)(a)
above are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any payments
of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension
period.
      (3)   (a)   Nothing in this division (N)(3) denies to any person
described in this division the application of divisions (N)(1) and (N)(2)
above.
         (b)   1.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension
under the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in
which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of
time in which to make any payment of taxes required by Mariemont in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under this division (N)
(3)(b)1. shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that the
taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this division (N)
(3)(b)1., QUALIFYING TAXPAYER means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
            2.   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division
(N)(3)(b)1. above are not delinquent during the extension period. Such taxes
become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension period
if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator shall not
require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for
the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any period of
extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) above in calculating the penalty or
interest due on any unpaid tax.
      (4)   For each taxable year to which division (N)(1), (N)(2), or (N)(3)
above applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (N)(2)(b) and (N)(2)
(c) above, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
   (O)   Consolidated municipal income tax return.
      (1)   For the purpose of this division, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
         (a)   AFFILIATED GROUP OF CORPORATIONS. An affiliated group as defined
in § 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a group includes
at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily engaged in the
business of providing local exchange telephone service in this state, the
affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange carrier that
would otherwise be included in the group.
         (b)   CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. A consolidated return
filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to § 1501 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
         (c)   CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME. The consolidated taxable
income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the purposes of
filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before consideration of net
operating losses or special deductions. CONSOLI- DATED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME
does not include income or loss of an incumbent local exchange carrier that is
excluded from the affiliated group under division (O)(1)(a) above.
         (d)   INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIER. Has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 4927.01.
         (e) LOCAL EXCHANGE TELEPHONE SERVICE. Has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 5727.01.
      (2)   (a)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to Mariemont’s
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (O)(2)(b) below or a
taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator
shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
         (b)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (O)(2)(a) above. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
         (c)   An election made under division (O)(2)(a) or (O)(2)(b) above is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Mariemont income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm’s length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to Mariemont. A taxpayer that is required to file a
consolidated Mariemont income tax return for a taxable year shall file a
consolidated Mariemont income tax return for all subsequent taxable years,
unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax
Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change
in circumstances.
      (4)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Mariemont income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
      (5)   (a) Except as otherwise provided in divisions (O)(5)(b), (O)(5)(c),
and (O)(5)(d) below, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in §
97.02, by substituting “consolidated federal taxable income” for “federal
taxable income” wherever “federal taxable income” appears in that division and
by substituting “an affiliated group of corporation’s” for “a C corporation’s”
wherever “a C corporation’s” appears in that division.
         (b)   No corporation filing a consolidated Mariemont income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under §
97.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
         (c)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated Mariemont income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity’s net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
            1.   Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (O)(1) through (O)(8),
exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in
the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused to Mariemont. If
the entity’s net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to
taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity’s net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
            2.   Include the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (O)(1) through (O)(8),
include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in
the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused to Mariemont. If
the entity’s net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject
to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity’s net profits
that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated
group.
         (d)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
            1.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in (O)(1) through (O)(8), exclude
the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the
computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused to Mariemont; and
            2.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Mariemont income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (6)   Corporations filing a consolidated Mariemont income tax return
shall make the computations required under (O)(1) through (O)(8) by
substituting “consolidated federal taxable income attributable to” for “net
profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in that section and by
substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for “taxpayer” wherever
“taxpayer” appears in that section.
      (7) Each corporation filing a consolidated Mariemont income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by Mariemont in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
      (8)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with Mariemont before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with Mariemont may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

§ 97.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in Mariemont who is required to
and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter, may claim a
nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this chapter upon satisfactory
evidence that tax has been paid to another municipality. Subject to division
(C) below, the credit shall not exceed the amount obtained by multiplying the
income, qualifying wages, commissions, net profits, or other compensation
subject to tax in the other municipality by the lower of the tax rate in such
other municipality or the tax rate of 1.0%.
   (B)   Mariemont shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of Mariemont who works in a joint economic development zone created under R.C.
§ 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under R.C. §§
715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit against
its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another municipal
corporation.
   (C)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) above, “the income, qualifying
wages, commissions, net profits, or other compensation” subject to tax in the
other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by dividing the tax
withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for that
municipality.
(Ord. O-26-15, passed 11-23-2015)
§ 97.07 ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   ESTIMATED TAXES. The amount that the taxpayer reasonably estimates
to be the taxpayer’s tax liability for Mariemont’s income tax for the current
taxable year.
      (2)   TAX LIABILITY. The total taxes due to Mariemont for the taxable
year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and after
applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from another
taxable year.
   (B)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld for Mariemont from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to Mariemont in equal amounts on each payment date unless
the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld,
in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the
amounts were actually withheld; and
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division (B)
(1)(b), DATE OF THE POSTMARK means, in the event there is more than one date on
the cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than 12 months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under §
97.05(G) or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to Mariemont, including
the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 67.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
and
         (d)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, 90% of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with §
97.05.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to §
97.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) below.
The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment; and
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) above shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by
this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the
following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due;
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with Mariemont under §
97.05 for that year; and
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in Mariemont but was not
domiciled there on January 1 of the calendar year that includes the first day
of the taxable year.

§ 97.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
$0.50 shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part of a
dollar that is less than $0.50 shall be dropped. If a person chooses to round
amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts entered on
the document.
(Ord. O-26-15, passed 11-23-2015)
§ 97.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)   As used in this section, WITHHOLDING TAX has the same meaning as in §
97.18.
   (B)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by Mariemont:
      (1)   Overpayments of $10 or more; and
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is $10 or more.
   (C)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor’s claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (C)(3) below, the Tax Administrator shall issue an
assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially
denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was denied,
the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If the Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer’s originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
97.21.
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) above shall be considered to have been filed in a
timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request;
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day; or
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §
97.18(A)(4).
(Ord. O-26-15, passed 11-23-2015)
§ 97.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited with Mariemont, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by Mariemont as a refund
but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with Mariemont is subject to recovery by Mariemont. If
Mariemont’s tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, Mariemont
shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding Mariemont
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (C)   If Mariemont’s tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using
Mariemont’s tax rate. However, if Mariemont’s tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to Mariemont, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. O-26-15, passed 11-23-2015)
§ 97.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   If a taxpayer’s tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
Mariemont changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
Mariemont. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer’s consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return only:
         (a)   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or
         (b)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under §
97.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division (C) within the period prescribed by division (D) below for
filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period prescribed in
that division (D) if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of that division
(D). If the amount of the refund is less than $10, no refund need be paid by
Mariemont. A request filed under this division (C) shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in §
97.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s Mariemont’s tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Mariemont return showing income subject to
Mariemont income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state
tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Mariemont income tax shown
due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than $10.

§ 97.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) above may be
extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent of
the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension. Any
extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (C) below.
      (2)   As used in this section, QUALIFYING DEFERRAL PERIOD means a period
of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Review the request described in §
97.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Review did not
have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of
that assessment; and
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Review, the sixtieth day after
the date on which the final determination of the Board of Review is either
ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no further
appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that reversal is
available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in §
97.09.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by Mariemont does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Review, of the Ohio Board of
Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by §
97.09, with interest on that amount as provided by §
97.09(E).
   (E)   No civil action to recover Mariemont income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties; or
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. O-26-15, passed 11-23-2015)
§ 97.13 AUDITS.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer’s rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   (1)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer
is entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant,
bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a
form by which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
      (2)   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the
taxpayer’s attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
      (3)   This division (C) does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer’s case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. O-26-15, passed 11-23-2015)
§ 97.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   LAST KNOWN ADDRESS. The address the Tax Administrator has at the
time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the Tax
Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a change
of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery
service under R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   UNDELIVERABLE ADDRESS. An address to which the postal service or an
authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056 is not able to deliver an
assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-delivery is
because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) below, a copy of each assessment shall be
served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. § 5703.056. With
the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator
may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this
section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a
new last known address, including the use of a change of address service
offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. §
5703.056. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment’s postmark.
      (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other Mariemont official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local Board of Review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) above is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the
assessment is served.
      (2)   (a)   If mailing of an assessment by the Tax Administrator by
certified mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address,
the Tax Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The
assessment shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and
include the following statement:
   “This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date.”
         (b)   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable
address, the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery
of the assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
         (c)   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)
(1)(a) above. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
under this division in accordance with division (D) below.
   (D)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (C) above bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the
evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified mail
was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person’s agent or the person’s affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person’s affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee’s business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) above, and if that assessment is subject to collection and
is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60 days after the
initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Mariemont official, or the
designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division (D)(2) prevents
the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with
the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the local
Board of Review.
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator’s designee from delivering an assessment by personal service.
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) above, including those on which a claim has been delivered
for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under this
section.
   (G)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. O-26-15, passed 11-23-2015)
§ 97.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)   As used in this section, CLAIM means a claim for an amount payable to
Mariemont that arises pursuant to Mariemont’s income tax imposed in accordance
with this chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of Mariemont:
      (1)   Compromise a claim; or
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator’s rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. O-26-15, passed 11-23-2015)
§ 97.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person’s official duties or the official business of Mariemont as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax
Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit Mariemont from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. O-26-15, passed 11-23-2015) Penalty, see §
97.99
§ 97.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Mariemont ordinance or state law
to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel, or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud Mariemont or the Tax Administrator.

   (B)   (1)   This section applies to the following:

years beginning on or after January 1, 2016; and
         (b)   Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to Mariemont on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing

before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
Mariemont to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.

(Ord. O-26-15, passed 11-23-2015)
§ 97.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
   (A)   Authority. Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the
Tax Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless
the performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision
of the Ohio Revised Code:
      (1)   (a)   Exercise all powers whatsoever of an query nature as provided
by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records, memorandums,
and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under oath, to
issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths; and
         (b)   The powers referred to in this division (A)(1) shall be
exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance of
the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under Mariemont’s
income tax ordinance.
      (2)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)   Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and
states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)   Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax

provided in this chapter;
      (5)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to

      (6)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to the use of
alternative apportionment methods by taxpayers in accordance with §

orders the Tax Administrator is by law authorized and required to make and,
pursuant to time limitations provided by law, on the Tax Administrator’s own
motion, review, re-determine, or correct any tax findings, determinations,
computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made; and
      (b)   If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Review or other
appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-determine, or
correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order which the Tax
Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by the
appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final.
      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law; and
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in §
97.04.

may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.

to, the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator’s
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by Mariemont or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person’s
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division (B)(3) does not authorize the practice of law by
a person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
   (C)   Identification information.
      (1)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person’s Social Security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to §
97.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in §
97.99.
         (b)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under this division (C) above within 30
days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying information,
nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty
pursuant to §
97.18.
         (c)   The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (C)(2)
(b) above may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in §
97.09 for a violation of §
97.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.
(Ord. O-26-15, passed 11-23-2015)
§ 97.20 REQUEST FOR OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   An OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR means an opinion issued under this
section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It does not
include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator in accordance with the Rules and Regulations.
   (C)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (D)   The Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.
   (E)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds the Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (F)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal.

as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member’s predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Review.
      (6)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Review
due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Review in
the member’s place. The appointment of such an individual shall be subject to
the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the appointment of
the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)   Whenever the Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer’s right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board of Review by filing a request with the Board of Review. The
request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the
assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60
days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Board of Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60 days
after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) above, unless the
taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a hearing. If the
taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear before the Board
of Review and may be represented by an attorney at law, certified public
accountant, or other representative. The Board of Review may allow a hearing to
be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing
must be completed within 120 days after the first day of the hearing unless the
parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The Board of Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator’s assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Review
shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the Board
of Review’s final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Review’s final determination as provided
in R.C. § 5717.011.
   (F)   The Board of Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt rules
governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions. Such
records are not public records available for inspection under R.C. § 149.43.
Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to R.C. § 121.22.
(Ord. O-26-15, passed 11-23-2015)
§ 97.22 AUTHORITY TO CREATE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the legislative authority of
Mariemont, or the Tax Administrator pursuant to authority granted to the
administrator by resolution or ordinance, to adopt rules to administer an

section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable
year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in

lieu of a location described in division (F)(3)(a) or (b) of this section

liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer

§ 98.04 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   Withholding provisions.
   (A)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in Mariemont shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in Mariemont. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under §
98.03 or division (B)(4) or (B)(6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld
at the rate, specified in §
98.01(B), of 1.25%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall
deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the
employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays
the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the
employee.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of Mariemont the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of Mariemont in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of Mariemont in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded $200.
            Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to
the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month
for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (c)   [Intentionally left blank.]
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made (if so determined by the Tax Administrator) by electronic
funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes deducted and withheld on
behalf of Mariemont. The payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this
division does not affect an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to
file any return as required under this section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and Mariemont as the return
required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold Mariemont income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to Mariemont the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for
that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer
in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
Mariemont income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for Mariemont until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for Mariemont during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service Form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Mariemont income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)1. of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's principal place of work with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
         For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee

in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:

the filing of Mariemont's income tax return.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month

taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for

within Mariemont, make any sales in Mariemont, or otherwise become subject to
the tax levied by Mariemont during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by Mariemont for the taxable year, the affiant agrees
to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with
Mariemont's income tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The person shall
sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)(b)
of this section the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change.

or other payer as described in §
98.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by Mariemont, unless the amounts withheld were not

return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions
of this chapter and of Mariemont's ordinance, resolution, or rules and

support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of Mariemont
for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time
for payment of taxes required by Mariemont during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty
terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or

otherwise due to Mariemont before the 181st day after the applicant's active
duty or service terminates.

the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by Mariemont in accordance with
this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of
this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that
the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
division, QUALIFYING TAXPAYER means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to

taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.

taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to Mariemont's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue

binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under R.C. § 718.80, a
valid election made by a taxpayer under division (S)(l) or (S)(2) of this
section is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder of the five-year
period.
      (5)   When an election is made under R.C. § 718.80 is terminated, a valid
election made under R.C. § 718.86 is binding upon the Tax Administrator for the
remainder of the five-year period.
   (T)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Mariemont income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to Mariemont. A taxpayer that is required to file a
consolidated Mariemont income tax return for a taxable year shall file a
consolidated Mariemont income tax return for all subsequent taxable years,
unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax
Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change
in circumstances.

   (V)   (l)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (V)(3), and
(V)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income
tax return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in §
98.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Mariemont income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under §
98.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated Mariemont income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to Mariemont. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
this section, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to Mariemont. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to Mariemont;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Mariemont income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)   Corporations filing a consolidated Mariemont income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of this section
by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to" for "net
profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Mariemont income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by Mariemont in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (Y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with Mariemont before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with Mariemont may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter, may claim a
nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this chapter upon satisfactory
evidence that tax has been paid to another municipality. Subject to division
(C) of this section, the credit shall not exceed the amount obtained by
multiplying the income, qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other
compensation subject to tax in the other municipality by the LOWER of the tax
rate in such other municipality OR the tax rate of 1.0%.
   (B)   Mariemont shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident

§ 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under R.C. § 715.70,
715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit against its tax on
income to its residents who are employed in another municipal corporation.
   (C)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation subject to tax
in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by dividing
the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for that
municipality.

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld for Mariemont from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to Mariemont in equal amounts on each payment date unless
the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld,
in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the
amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
DATE OF THE POSTMARK means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than 12 months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under §
98.05(G) or on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the taxpayer
becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to Mariemont, including
the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the 15th day of the sixth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the 15th day of the ninth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 67.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the 15th day of the 12th month of the taxable year,
90% of the tax liability for the taxable year. For taxable years beginning on
or after January 1, 2018, for an individual on or before the 15th day of the
first month of the following taxable year, 90% of the tax liability for the
taxable year.

shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or

return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid with the
return in accordance with §
98.05.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to § 98.18 upon the
amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless the underpayment
is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of this section. The
amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with Mariemont under §
98.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in Mariemont but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.

   (A)   As used in this section, withholding tax has the same meaning as in §
98.18.
   (B)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax

   (C)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (C)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall
issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was
denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the
assessment.
      (3)   If the Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
98.21.
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §
98.18(A)(4).

§ 98.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.

been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by Mariemont as a refund
but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with Mariemont is subject to recovery by Mariemont. If
Mariemont's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a

shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding Mariemont
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (C)   If Mariemont's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonefundable credit shall be calculated using
Mariemont's tax rate. However, if Mariemont's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to Mariemont, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.

§ 98.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
Mariemont changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
Mariemont. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (a)   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (b)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under §
98.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than $10, no refund need be
paid by Mariemont. A request filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in §
98.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Mariemont's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Mariemont return showing income subject to
Mariemont income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state
tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Mariemont income tax shown
due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or

§ 98.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, QUALIFYING DEFERRAL PERIOD means a period
of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Review the request described in §
98.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Review did not
have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of
that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the 60th day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Review, the 60th day after the
date on which the final determination of the Board of Review is either
ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no further
appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that reversal is
available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in §
98.09.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by Mariemont does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Review, of the Ohio Board of
Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by §
98.09, with interest on that amount as provided by §
98.09(E).
   (E)   No civil action to recover Mariemont income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

§ 98.13 AUDITS.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
      A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the
taxpayer's attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
      This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is
not an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. O-8-18, passed 2-12-2018; Ord. O-8-20, passed 2-24-2020)
§ 98.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   LAST KNOWN ADDRESS means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail or any address the Tax
Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a change
of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery
service under R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   UNDELIVERABLE ADDRESS means an address to which the postal service
or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056 is not able to deliver
an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-delivery
is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. § 5703.056. With
the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator
may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this
section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a
new last known address, including the use of a change of address service
offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. §
5703.056. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark
         (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other Mariemont official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local Board of Review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete,
and that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by the Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
   "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
         Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
         If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)
(1)(a) of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Mariemont
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local Board of Review.
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by personal service.
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.

§ 98.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)   As used in this section, CLAIM means a claim for an amount payable to
Mariemont that arises pursuant to Mariemont's income tax imposed in accordance
with this chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of Mariemont:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.

§ 98.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of Mariemont as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax
Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit Mariemont from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. O-8-18, passed 2-12-2018; Ord. O-8-20, passed 2-24-2020)
§ 98.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Mariemont ordinance or state law
to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud Mariemont or the Tax Administrator.

agent, or other payer is required to withhold from an employee's qualifying
wages.
   (B)   (1)   This section applies to the following:
         (a)   Any return required to be filed under applicable law for taxable
years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         (b)   Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to Mariemont on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
Mariemont to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (C)   Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer

§ 98.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
   Authority.
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the

that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee

levied by Mariemont or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the

papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing

person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying

the request was directed pursuant to §
98.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in §
98.99.
         (b)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide

this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee

subject to appeal.

remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the

the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the appointment of
the member temporarily unable to serve.

Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may

unlawful to operate any public vehicle or permit the same to be operated unless
the applicant deposits with the Mayor a policy of liability insurance issued by
a responsible insurance company, approved as to sufficiency by the Mayor and as
to legality by the Village Solicitor. This insurance shall provide indemnity
for, or protection to, the insured against loss in the amounts provided for in
§

creditor who has filed his or her suit or notice of a claim for loss with the

   (A)   Any license to operate a driverless auto-for- hire shall be issued or

same to be operated, unless and until the applicant deposits with the Mayor a
policy or policies of liability insurance issued by a responsible insurance
company, approved as to sufficiency by the Mayor and as to legality by the
Village Solicitor, providing indemnity for or protection to the rentee against
loss in the amounts provided for in §
112.09, and agreeing to pay within the limits of the amounts fixed in this
section to any judgment creditor any final judgment rendered against the rentee
by reason of liability of the rentee to pay damages to others except to
occupants of the driverless auto-for-hire for bodily injures, including death
at any time resulting therefrom, and for damages to or destruction of property
sustained during the term of the policy resulting from negligent operation,
maintenance, or use of the driverless auto- for-hire. Any person claiming the
protection of this section shall, within 30 days after the date of the accident
out of which the injury or damage arises, file with the Mayor his or her claim
for injury or damages together with a statement setting forth, to the best of
his or her knowledge, the day, hour, and place of the accident, the license
number of the vehicle at fault, the name and address of the driver, if known,

are known to him or her. When the injured person is by the accident rendered
incapable of preparing the claim and statement required herein, the claim and
statement may be filed within 30 days after the person is able to prepare the
same or, in the case of death resulting from the injury, within 30 days after
the date of death.
   (B)   The policy of insurance required by this section may provide that if a
rentee is independently insured against liability, the indemnity herein
provided shall not apply except to the extent that the independent insurance
shall be inadequate to furnish the protection required by §
112.09.
   (C)   In lieu of the policy or policies of insurance provided for in this
section, the owner may furnish a bond executed by himself or herself as owner,
without sureties, approved as to legality by the Village Solicitor, holding and

assumed by an insurer in the case of policies of insurance provided for herein.
   (D)   It shall be further permissible for the owner to furnish insurance as
to damages for personal injuries, including death, and an indemnity bond as to
property damages or vice versa.
   (E)   In lieu of either of the alternatives set forth, the owner may furnish
insurance to the extent of not less than one-third of the amounts required by §
112.09 and, in addition, furnish a bond executed by himself or herself as owner
for the remainder of the required liability; however, in that event, the
insurance policy shall provide that if any liability accrues, the liability
shall first be satisfied out of that insurance, and if the insurance is
insufficient in amount to cover the total liability, the excess shall be
satisfied out of bond executed by the owner.
   (F)   If the owner of a driverless auto-for-hire is obligated under his or
her bond, executed in accordance with the provisions of division (A) above, to
pay a judgment recovered against a rentee of such public vehicle and the
judgment shall remain unsatisfied for a period of 30 days after it becomes
final, the Mayor, on being advised of the fact, shall forthwith revoke the
driverless auto-for-hire license or licenses held by that owner.
   (G)   Every rentee of a driverless auto-for-hire shall designate and
constitute the owner as his or her agent to accept service or summons for and
on his or her behalf in any action based on negligent operation, maintenance,
or use of the vehicle. The owner shall agree to accept summons for and on
behalf of the rentee under those circumstances. The provisions of this section
shall be embodied in the rental contract and in the policy or insurance or bond
filed by the owner with the Mayor.

notice before the cancellation, expiration, lapse, or other termination of that
insurance, or the expiration, withdrawal of the surety therefrom or other

the insurance or bond, or on termination of the liability of the insurer or
surety thereon, in accordance with such notice, until a new policy or
certificate of liability insurance, or a new indemnity bond, approved as
hereinbefore provided, is substituted therefor. Failure to give notice required
shall operate to continue the liability of the insurer or surety for the
benefit of persons injured or damaged, and the policy shall continue in full
force and effect.

§ 130.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
      CULPABILITY. Means purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in R.C. § 2901.22.
      INTOXICATION. Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting from
the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Means reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      POSSESSION. Means a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21) (2000 Code, § 130.07)
§ 130.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22) (2000 Code, § 130.08)
§ 130.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. The term does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23) (2000 Code, § 130.09)
§ 130.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in R.C.
§ 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if
he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24) (2000 Code, § 130.10)
§ 130.11 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Ch. 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a
misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor. In
the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C. Ch. 3734,
other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an attempt is a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under this
section.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      MOTOR VEHICLE. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.
(R.C. § 2923.02) (2000 Code, § 130.11)
Statutory reference:
   Conspiracy, see R.C. § 2923.01
   Solid and hazardous wastes, see R.C. Ch. 3734
§ 130.12 COMPLICITY.
   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of R.C. § 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(R.C. § 2923.03) (2000 Code, § 130.12)
Statutory reference:
   Conspiracy, see R.C. § 2923.01
§ 130.13 PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE; PROOF OF OFFENSE; AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.
   (A)   Every person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the burden of proof for all elements of
the offense is upon the prosecution. The burden of going forward with the
evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof by a preponderance
of the evidence, for an affirmative defense other than self-defense, defense of
another, or defense of the accused’s residence presented as described in
division (B)(1) of this section, is upon the accused.
   (B)   (1)   A person is allowed to act in self-defense, defense of another,
or defense of that person’s residence. If, at the trial of a person who is
accused of an offense that involved the person’s use of force against another,
there is evidence presented that tends to support that the accused person used
the force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person’s
residence, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused person did not use the force in self-defense, defense of another, or
defense of that person’s residence, as the case may be.
      (2)   Subject to division (B)(3) of this section, a person is presumed to
have acted in self-defense or defense of another when using defensive force
that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to another if
the person against whom the defensive force is used is in the process of
unlawfully and without privilege to do so entering, or has unlawfully and
without privilege to do so entered, the residence or vehicle occupied by the
person using the defensive force.
      (3)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section does
not apply if either of the following is true:
         (a)   The person against whom the defensive force is used has a right
to be in, or is a lawful resident of, the residence or vehicle.
         (b)   The person who uses the defensive force uses it while in a
residence or vehicle and the person is unlawfully, and without privilege to be,
in that residence or vehicle.
      (4)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section is a
rebuttable presumption and may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence,
provided that the prosecution’s burden of proof remains proof beyond a
reasonable doubt as described in divisions (A) and (B)(1) of this section.
   (C)   As part of its charge to the jury in a criminal case, the court shall
read the definitions of “reasonable doubt” and “proof beyond a reasonable
doubt”, contained in division (E) of this section.
   (D)   As used in this section:
      AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. An affirmative defense is either of the following:
         (a)   A defense expressly designated as affirmative;
         (b)   A defense involving an excuse or justification peculiarly within
the knowledge of the accused, on which the accused can fairly be required to
adduce supporting evidence.
      DWELLING. Means a building or conveyance of any kind that has a roof over
it and that is designed to be occupied by people lodging in the  building or
conveyance at night, regardless of whether the building or conveyance is
temporary or permanent or is mobile or immobile. As used in this division, a
building or conveyance includes but is not limited to an attached porch, and a
building or conveyance with a roof over it includes but is not limited to a
tent.
      RESIDENCE. Means a dwelling in which a person resides either temporarily
or permanently or is visiting as a guest.
      VEHICLE. Means a conveyance of any kind, whether or not motorized, that
is designed to transport people or property.
   (E)   “Reasonable doubt” is present when the jurors, after they have
carefully considered and compared all the evidence, cannot say they are firmly
convinced of the truth of the charge. It is a doubt based on reasonable and
common sense. Reasonable doubt is not mere possible doubt, because everything
relating to human affairs or depending on moral evidence is open to some
possible or imaginary doubt. “Proof beyond a reasonable doubt” is proof of such
character that an ordinary person would be willing to rely and act upon it in
the most important of the person's own affairs.
(R.C. § 2901.05) (2000 Code, § 130.13)
§ 130.14 BATTERED WOMAN SYNDROME.
   (A)   The municipality hereby declares that it recognizes both of the
following, in relation to the “battered woman syndrome”: that the syndrome
currently is a matter of commonly accepted scientific knowledge, and that the
subject matter and details of the syndrome are not within the general
understanding or experience of a person who is a member of the general populace
and are not within the field of common knowledge.
   (B)   (1)   If a person is charged with an offense involving the use of
force against another and the person, as a defense to the offense charged,
raises the affirmative defense of self defense, the person may introduce expert
testimony of the “battered woman syndrome” and expert testimony that the person
suffered from that syndrome as evidence to establish the requisite belief of an
imminent danger of death or great bodily harm that is necessary, as an element
of the affirmative defense, to justify the person’s use of force in question.
      (2)   The introduction of any expert testimony under this division shall
be in accordance with the Ohio Rules of Evidence.
(R.C. § 2901.06) (2000 Code, § 130.14)
§ 130.15 DELINQUENCY ADJUDICATIONS DEEMED CONVICTIONS.
   (A)   If a person is alleged to have committed an offense and if the person
previously has been adjudicated a delinquent child or juvenile traffic offender
for a violation of a law or ordinance, except as provided in division (B)
below, the adjudication as a delinquent child or as a juvenile traffic offender
is a conviction for a violation of the law for purposes of determining the
offense with which the person should be charged and, if the person is convicted
of or pleads guilty to an offense, the sentence to be imposed upon the person
relative to the conviction or guilty plea.
   (B)   A previous adjudication of a person as a delinquent child or juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of a law or ordinance is not a conviction for
a violation of the law or ordinance for purposes of determining any of the
following:
      (1)   Whether the person is a repeat violent offender, as defined in R.C.
§ 2929.01, or whether the person should be sentenced as a repeat violent
offender under R.C. § 2929.14(B)(2) and R.C. § 2941.149;
      (2)    Whether the person is a violent career criminal as defined in R.C.
§ 2923.132, whether the person has committed unlawful use of a weapon by a
violent career criminal in violation of R.C. § 2923.132 or should be sentenced
for that offense under that section, or whether the person should be sentenced
under R.C. § 2929.14(K) as a violent career criminal who had a firearm on or
about the person’s person or under the person’s control while committing a
violent felony offense and displayed or brandished the firearm, indicated that
the offender possessed a firearm, or used the firearm to facilitate the
offense.
(R.C. § 2901.08) (2000 Code, § 130.15)
§ 130.16 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (A)   A person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this municipality,
any element of which takes place in this municipality;
      (2)   While in this municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this municipality and the
other jurisdiction, or, while in this municipality, the person conspires to
commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under
both the laws of this municipality and the other jurisdiction, and a
substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is undertaken in this
municipality by the person or another person involved in the conspiracy,
subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any case in which a
person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the commission of, or
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as described in this
division, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and for any resulting
offense that is committed or completed in the other jurisdiction;
      (3)   While out of this municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
municipality;
      (4)   While out of this municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction, or activity in this municipality;
      (5)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this municipality;
      (6)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another person and subsequently brings the other person into this
municipality;
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
municipality in violation of the law of this state or municipality.
   (B)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (A)(1) above includes
the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes death, the death
itself, or any other element that is set forth in the offense in question. If
any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this municipality, the
death is presumed to have occurred within this municipality.
   (C)   (1)   This municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
municipality for purposes of this section.
      (2)   The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,
Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe,
Scioto, and Washington counties have jurisdiction beyond the north or northwest
shore of the Ohio River extending to the opposite shore line, between the
extended boundary lines of any adjacent counties or adjacent state. Each of
those courts of common pleas has concurrent jurisdiction on the Ohio River with
any adjacent court of common pleas that borders on that river and with any
court of Kentucky or of West Virginia that borders on the Ohio River and that
has jurisdiction on the Ohio River under the law of Kentucky or the law of West
Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under federal law.
   (D)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
municipality for purposes of this section.
   (E)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this municipality for an offense committed or completed outside this
municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this municipality.
   (F)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (G)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this municipality.
   (H)   For purposes of division (A)(2) above, an overt act is substantial
when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of the actor
that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (I)   As used in this section, COMPUTER, COMPUTER SYSTEM, COMPUTER NETWORK,
INFORMATION SERVICE, TELE COMMUNICATION, TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEVICE,
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE, DATA and WRITING have the same meanings as in R.C.
§ 2913.01.

does not hold a permit issued under R.C. Chapters 4301 and 4303 or otherwise
forfeited to the state for an offense under R.C. § 4301.45 or R.C. § 4301.53
shall be sold by the Division of Liquor Control if the Division determines that
it is fit for sale or shall be placed in the custody of the Investigations Unit
in the Ohio Department of Public Safety and be used for training relating to
law enforcement activities. The Ohio Department of Public Safety, with the
assistance of the Division of Liquor Control, shall adopt rules in accordance
with R.C. Chapter 119 to provide for the distribution to state or local law
enforcement agencies upon their request. If any tax imposed under R.C. Title 43
has not been paid in relation to the beer, intoxicating liquor, or alcohol, any
moneys acquired from the sale shall first be used to pay the tax. All other
money collected under this division (B)(1)(d) shall be paid into the State
Treasury. Any beer, intoxicating liquor, or alcohol that the Division
determines to be unfit for sale shall be destroyed.
         (e)   Money received by an inmate of a correctional institution from
an unauthorized source or in an unauthorized manner shall be returned to the
sender, if known, or deposited in the Inmates’ Industrial and Entertainment
Fund of the institution if the sender is not known.
         (f)   1.   Any mobile instrumentality forfeited under R.C. Chapter
2981 may be given to the law enforcement agency that initially seized the
mobile instrumentality for use in performing its duties, if the agency wants
the mobile instrumentality. The agency shall take the mobile instrumentality
subject to any security interest or lien on the mobile instrumentality.
            2.   Vehicles and vehicle parts forfeited under R.C. §§ 4549.61 to
4549.63 may be given to a law enforcement agency for use in performing its
duties. Those parts may be incorporated into any other official vehicle. Parts
that do not bear vehicle identification numbers or derivatives of them may be
sold or disposed of as provided by rules of the Director of Public Safety.
Parts from which a vehicle identification number or derivative of it has been
removed, defaced, covered, altered, or destroyed and that are not suitable for
police work or incorporation into an official vehicle shall be destroyed and
sold as junk or scrap.
         (g)   Computers, computer networks, computer systems, and computer
software suitable for police work may be given to a law enforcement agency for
that purpose or disposed of under division (B)(2) of this section.
         (h)   Money seized in connection with a violation of R.C. § 2905.32,
2907.21, or 2907.22 shall be deposited in the Victims of Human Trafficking Fund
created by R.C. § 5101.87.
      (2)   Unclaimed or forfeited property that is not described in division
(B)(1) of this section or division (A)(1)(b) of this section, with court
approval, may be used by the law enforcement agency in possession of it. If it
is not used by the agency, it may be sold without appraisal at a public auction
to the highest bidder for cash or disposed of in another manner that the court
considers proper.
      (3)   Except as provided in divisions (B)(1) and (B)(5) of this section
and after compliance with division (B)(4) of this section when applicable, any
moneys acquired from the sale of property disposed of pursuant to this section
shall be placed in the General Revenue Fund of the state, or the General Fund
of the municipality.
      (4)   If the property was in the possession of the Police Department in
relation to a delinquent child proceeding in a juvenile court, 10% of any
moneys acquired from the sale of property disposed of under this section shall
be applied to one or more community addiction services providers, as defined in
R.C. § 5119.01. A juvenile court shall not specify a services provider, except
as provided in this division, unless the services provider is in the same
county as the court or in a contiguous county. If no services provider is
located in any of those counties, the juvenile court may specify a services
provider anywhere in Ohio. The remaining 90% of the proceeds or cash shall be
applied as provided in division (B)(3) of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If the Board of County Commissioners recognizes a citizens’
reward program under R.C. § 9.92, the Board shall notify the Police Department
of the recognition by filing a copy of its resolution conferring that
recognition with the Police Department. When the Board recognizes a citizens’
reward program and the county includes a part, but not all, of the territory of
the municipality, the Board shall so notify the Police Department of the
recognition of the citizens’ reward program only if the county contains the
highest percentage of the municipality’s population.
         (b)   Upon being so notified, the Police Department shall pay 25% of
any forfeited proceeds or cash derived from each sale of property disposed of
pursuant to this section to the citizens’ reward program for use exclusively to
pay rewards. No part of the funds may be used to pay expenses associated with
the program. If a citizens’ reward program that operates in more than one
county or in another state in addition to this state receives funds under this
section, the funds shall be used to pay rewards only for tips and information
to law enforcement agencies concerning offenses committed in the county from
which the funds were received.
      (6)   Any property forfeited under R.C. Chapter 2981 not be used to pay
any fine imposed upon a person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an
underlying criminal offense or a different offense arising out of the same
facts and circumstances.
      (7)   Any moneys acquired from the sale of personal effects, tools, or
other property seized because the personal effects, tools, or other property
were used in the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2905.32, 2907.21, or
2907.22 or derived from the proceeds of the commission of a violation of R.C. §
2905.32, 2907.21, or 2907.22 and disposed of pursuant to this division (B)
shall be placed in the Victims of Human Trafficking Fund created by R.C. §
5101.87.
(R.C. § 2981.12)
   (C)   Disposition of contraband, proceeds, or instrumentalities. Except as
otherwise provided in R.C. § 2981.13, property ordered forfeited as contraband,
proceeds, or an instrumentality pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2981 shall be disposed
of, used, or sold pursuant to division (B) of this section or R.C. § 2981.12.
If the property is to be sold under division (B) of this section or R.C. §
2981.12, the prosecutor shall cause notice of the proposed sale to be given in
accordance with law.

§ 130.18 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (A)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by R.C. §
1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the Ohio
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of §
130.99 or
133.99 of this code or R.C. §§ 2929.23 through 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under §
130.99(C) through (G). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (B)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         (a)   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         (b)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         (c)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         (d)   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability, or other factor
made the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of
the offense more serious;
         (e)   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B)(1)(b) and
(B)(1)(c) above;
         (f)   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         (g)   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (B)(1) above, the court may consider any
other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and principles of
sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
   (C)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
130.99(D), (E), (F), and (G). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
130.99(C) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (D)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim's representative, the victim's
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. §§ 2743.51 through 2743.72.
(R.C. § 2929.22) (2000 Code, § 130.18)
§ 130.19 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) below, R.C. § 2929.14(C), or R.C. §
2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of imprisonment shall
be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment imposed by a court of this municipality, this state, another
state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (B)(2) below, a
jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor shall be served
concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for felony served
in a state or federal correctional institution.
   (B)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of R.C. §
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving
the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served in a state
correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and
prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies
under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive
terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony
before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 2929.41) (2000 Code, § 130.19)
§ 130.20 APPREHENSION, DETENTION, OR ARREST OF PERSONS ON BOND.
   (A)   No person, other than a law enforcement officer, shall apprehend,
detain, or arrest a principal on bond, wherever issued, unless that person
meets all of the following criteria:
      (1)   The person is any of the following:
         (a)   Qualified, licensed, and appointed as a surety bail bond agent
under R.C. §§ 3905.83 through 3905.95;
         (b)   Licensed as a surety bail bond agent by the state where the bond
was written;
         (c)   Licensed as a private investigator under R.C. Ch. 4749;
         (d)   Licensed as a private investigator by the state where the bond
was written;
         (e)   An off-duty peace officer, as defined in R.C. § 2921.51.
      (2)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining, or arresting the
principal, has entered into a written contract with the surety or with a
licensed surety bail bond agent appointed by the surety, which contract sets
forth the name of the principal who is to be apprehended, detained, or
arrested. For purposes of this division (A)(2), SURETY has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 3905.83.
      (3)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining, or arresting the
principal, has notified the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction
over the area in which such activities will be performed and has provided any
form or identification or other information requested by the law enforcement
agency.
   (B)   No person shall represent the person’s self to be a bail enforcement
agent or bounty hunter, or claim any similar title, in this municipality.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of illegal bail bond agent
practices.
      (1)   A violation of division (A) above is a misdemeanor of the first
degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty
to two or more violations of division (A) above, or any substantially
equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be prosecuted under
appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (B) above is a misdemeanor of the first
degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty
to two or more violations of division (B) above, or any substantially
equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be prosecuted under
appropriate state law.
(R.C. § 2927.27)
§ 130.21 SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (C)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self- defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09)
§ 130.22 METHODS OF ARREST.
   Arrests of persons charged with misdemeanors under state or village law may
be made by taking the person charged into custody or by serving the person with
a citation to appear before a court having jurisdiction of the offense charged.
(1967 Code, § 130.21) (Ord. O-10-41, passed 12-8-1941)
§ 130.99 PENALTY FOR TITLE XIII.
   (A)   Generally. Except where otherwise specifically classified within the
body of the section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section
shall be deemed a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more
than $500, imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.
(R.C. § 715.67)
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) above shall be reasonably calculated to
achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set forth in
division (B)(1) above, commensurate with and not demeaning to the seriousness
of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim, and consistent with
sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) above
shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender, or
religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) above shall not apply to any offense
that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court pursuant to
Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any provision of the
Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is disposed of without a
court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) through (B)(3) above do not affect any
penalties established by the municipality for a violation of its ordinances
that are not substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor
violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21)
   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
130.18 or
133.99 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
division (C) may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
division (E)(2) below. The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C) and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this division (C),
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. § 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. § 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. above and does not pay the bill by the times specified in R.C. §
2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment against the
person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. above.
      (5)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(5)(a)2. below, an additional definite
jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(5)(a) above, the court may directly impose on the offender a
sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing, continual
tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time specified by
the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal the duration
of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon the offender
under division (C)(5)(a) above. A sanction imposed under this division shall
commence on the date specified by the court, provided that the sanction shall
not commence until after the offender has served the jail term imposed for the
misdemeanor violation of R.C. §§ 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and any residential sanction
imposed for the violation under division (E) below or R.C. § 2929.26. A
sanction imposed under this division shall be considered to be a community
control sanction for purposes of division (D) below or R.C. § 2929.25, and all
provisions of this code and the Ohio Revised Code that pertain to community
control sanctions shall apply to a sanction imposed under this division, except
to the extent that they would by their nature be clearly inapplicable. The
offender shall pay all costs associated with a sanction imposed under this
division, including the cost of the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under divisions (E) or (F) below for
any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in §§
130.18 and
133.99 of this code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or (G) below. The
court may impose any other conditions of release under a community control
sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a jail term
upon the offender, the court may impose any community control sanction or
combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) above from the range of
jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all or a
portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) below.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. above, the court shall state the duration of the community control
sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the conditions
of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any of the
following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) below;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) below, but the court is not required to impose any
particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) above.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
above, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the
period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) below, the court shall place the offender under the
general control and supervision of the court or of a department of probation in
the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting to the court a
violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If the offender
resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has been
established to serve the municipal court or county court in that jurisdiction,
the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the county court to
receive the offender into the general control and supervision of that
department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing court a
violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The sentencing
court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for the duration
of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under divisions (E), (F), or (G) below, and the offender
violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private person
or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that comprises
the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing court or to
the department of probation or probation officer with general control and
supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or entity
reports the violation to the department of probation or probation officer, the
department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing court.
         (b)   Except as provided in division (D)(4)(c) of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) above;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision
under R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (D)(4)(b) of
this section based on the violation.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) above, the total time spent in jail for the misdemeanor
offense and the violation of a condition of the community control sanction
shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for which the
sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the longer period
of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer sanction or the
more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) above by all or part
of the time the violator successfully spent under the sanction that was
initially imposed.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an
offender, for a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a
community control sanction imposed pursuant to divisions (E), (F), or (G) below
in an exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the
community control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control
sanction.
         (b)   Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does
not relieve the offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G)
below.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E). Community residential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (E)
(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including
but not limited to hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious diseases. The
person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who
refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including but not limited to hepatitis A, B, and C, or another contagious
disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)
   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of day reporting;
         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         (c)   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor
of the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or
fourth degree;
         (d)   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         (e)   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         (f)   A term of basic probation supervision;
         (g)   A term of monitored time;
         (h)   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         (i)   A curfew term;
         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) above the offender may request that the court modify the
sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable contribution, as
determined by the court, to the general fund of the county, municipality, or
other local entity that provides funding to the court. The court may grant the
request if the offender demonstrates a change in circumstances from the date
the court imposes the sentence or that the modification would otherwise be in
the interests of justice. If the court grants the request, the offender shall
make a reasonable contribution to the court, and the clerk of the court shall
deposit that contribution into the general fund of the county, municipality, or
other local entity that provides funding to the court. If more than one entity
provides funding to the court, the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the
reasonable contribution equal to the percentage of funding the entity provides
to the court in that entity’s general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1)
above, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor
misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory jail
term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the offender
or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) above.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (G) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (G), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (G) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or the victim's estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim's representative, victim's attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor's designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim's costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim's representative, victim's attorney, if applicable, or victim's estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim's estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (G) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim's attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim's estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1. and
(G)(1)(b)2. below payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         (c)   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. above
shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able to pay
and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may collect
any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) above in lieu
of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court does not
determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term of
community service under division (F)(1) above in lieu of or in addition to
imposing a financial sanction under this division (G) and in addition to
imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a minor
misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(4) above in lieu of or in addition to
imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to imposing
court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court costs, the
court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction or court
costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) above to pay the costs incurred by a
county pursuant to any sanction imposed under divisions (E) and (F) above or
this division (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine
offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) above to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s General Fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
divisions (E) or (F) above or this division (G) in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) above.
         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) above to pay the costs incurred by a municipal
corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under divisions (E) or (F) or this
division (G) or in operating a facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a
sanction imposed under division (E) above to the treasurer of the municipal
corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the municipal
corporation’s General Fund. The municipal corporation shall use the amounts
deposited in the fund to pay the costs incurred by the municipal corporation
pursuant to any sanction imposed under divisions (E) or (F) above or this
division (G) or in operating a facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a
sanction imposed under division (E) above.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c) above for the costs incurred by a private provider pursuant
to a sanction imposed under divisions (E) or (F) above or this division (G) to
the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (G), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to
be credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. §
111.48.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) above is a judgment in favor
of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that imposed
the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is
the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c)1.a. above upon an offender is a judgment in favor of the
entity administering the community control sanction, and the offender subject
to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of
reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.b. above upon an offender
confined in a jail or other residential facility is a judgment in favor of the
entity operating the jail or other residential facility, and the offender
subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction
of restitution imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(a) above is an order in
favor of the victim of the offender’s criminal act that can be collected
through a certificate of judgment as described in division (G)(5)(b)1. below,
through execution as described in division (G)(5)(b)2. below or through an
order as described in division (G)(5)(b)3. below and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action.
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (G)(5) above for the
collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (G) may designate the clerk of the court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:Each court
imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under this division (G) may
designate the clerk of the court or another person to collect the financial
sanction. The clerk, or another person authorized by law or the court to
collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         (a)   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 through 307.92.
         (b)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the board of county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
      (10)   If an offender is sentenced to pay restitution, a fine, fee, or
incarceration costs, the clerk of the sentencing court, on request, shall make
the offender's payment history available to the victim, victim's
representative, victim's attorney, if applicable, the prosecutor, the probation
department, and the court without cost.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
   (H)   Organizational penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this section, an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $3,000;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $2,000;
         (e)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $1,000;
         (f)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$2,000;
         (g)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than $1,000.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.

a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. When a
series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of violations of, attempts
to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations
of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an active duty service
member or spouse of an active duty service member, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. The value of
the property or services involved in the series of offenses for the purpose of
determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value
of all property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. §
2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more than one
victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant
to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a
single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed
against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active
duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single

services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40,

offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under divisions (B)(1), (B)(2) or
(B)(3) above, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense
in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender,
within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or violations
of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same employment,
capacity, or relationship to another as described in divisions (B)(1) or (B)(3)
above, or committed one or more theft offenses that involve a common course of
conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as
described in division (B)(2) above. While it is not necessary to separately
allege and prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single
offense under divisions (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3) above, it remains necessary
in prosecuting them as a single offense to prove the aggregate value of the
property or services in order to meet the requisite statutory offense level
sought by the prosecution.
   (C)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (C)(1) above, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing such
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under divisions (C)(1) or (C)(2) above, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, FAIR MARKET
VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as
to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it contains any
amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of unit

prosecution for a violation of R.C. § 2925.041 or a violation of this chapter,
R.C. Ch. 2925 or R.C. Ch. 3719 that is based on the possession of chemicals
sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation, or substance included

analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion

the accused person, or the accused’s attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis

present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis of the
alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further written
request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the
measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at
conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number of
unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

basis of, or involved in, the offense to determine whether the substance
contained any amount of a controlled substance if the results of the tests

(2000 Code, § 151.020) (Ord. O-4-96, passed 3-25-1996)
§ 151.021 PERMITS, CERTIFICATES, AND FEES.
   (A)   Generally. Building permits, certificates of occupancy, and/or
conditional use permits are required for all structure installations,
modifications, demolitions, all change in uses, and all conditional uses where
specified and regulated by the Building Code and this chapter, except for “play
structures” and “tree houses” as defined herein and which meet the requirements
set forth in §
151.087(J) and (K). The property owner, and not the village, is responsible for
the safe construction and use of play structures and tree houses. Certificate

located within a historic district and for all modifications to landmark sites.
Fees for permits and certificates shall be as set forth in the Building Code.
   (B)   Building permits. All applications for building permits shall be
accompanied by plans and specifications in triplicate as provided by the
Building Code, and a plan drawn to scale in triplicate showing the actual shape
and dimensions of the lot to be built on, the size and location of all trees
larger than six inches in diameter, when measured at a height of five feet from
the ground, the exact size and location on the lot of the buildings and
accessory buildings existing, and the lines within which the proposed building
shall be erected or altered, the existing and intended use of each building or
part of a building, the number of families or housekeeping units the building
is designed to accommodate, and such other information with regard to the lot,
and neighboring lots within 200 feet, such as fencing, walls, driveways, decks,
patios, or accessory structures, as may be necessary for the enforcement of
this chapter. One copy of these plans shall be returned to the owner when the
plans shall have been approved by the Building Commissioner. All dimensions
shown on these plans relating to the location and size of the lot to be built
upon shall be based on an actual survey by a duly licensed land surveyor. The
lot and location of the building thereon shall be staked out on the ground
before construction is started. A record of applications and plats shall be
kept in the office of the Building Commissioner.
      (1)   No building permit shall be issued unless the plans and
specifications required by this section demonstrate that the exterior design
and architectural character of the proposed structure will not be at such
variance with existing structures in the immediate vicinity as to cause
substantial depreciation in the property values of such existing structures.
This determination will be done by the Building Department. Any proposed
demolition of an architectural feature on an existing residence must be noted
on the plans and is subject to approval from the Building Department. If the
residence is a contributing property to the NHL application, is an historic
site, structure, or landmark, or is located within the historic district, no
permit shall issue unless the proposed changes are first approved by the
Architectural Review Board as prescribed by division (E) below in accordance

any new building be occupied for any purpose until a certificate of occupancy
has been issued by the Building Commissioner. Every certificate of occupancy
shall state that the new use complies with all provisions of the Building Code
and this chapter (see also Building Code § 1260, Housing Code).
      (2)   In order to obtain a certificate of occupancy, the applicant shall
file an application with the Building Commissioner, indicating intended use and
occupancy for a building or premises, accompanied by a basic data package (§
151.026) where applicable. Where necessary in the opinion of the Building
Commissioner, two sets of detailed plans may be required. In all cases a
general inspection is required. Existing buildings and changing use shall meet
the requirements as specified in the Village Building Code and this chapter.
When on examination and inspection it is found that the use and building
conform substantially to the provisions of the Building Code and this chapter
for such occupancy, the Building Commissioner shall issue a certificate of
occupancy. A record of all certificates of occupancy shall be kept on file in
the office of the Building Commissioner.
      (3)   A temporary certificate of occupancy for a part of a building or
premises may be issued by the Building Commissioner under such conditions as
may be prescribed by the Planning Commission.

its recommendations to the Village Council. The Council shall have 30 days to
review and approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application.

   (E)   Certificate of appropriateness.
      (1)   Generally. A request for a certificate of appropriateness shall be
filed with the Building Commissioner who shall forward it to the Architectural
Review Board prior to modification of any landmark, a historic site, a landmark
structure, or a structure located within a historic district whenever a
building permit is required and in the following circumstances:
         (a)   Whenever any modification of a historic site is proposed, or a
landmark structure, or a structure located within a historic district, whether
public or private, is proposed to undergo alteration, reconstruction,
enlargement, remodeling, painting, or staining, involving the exterior design,
material, or orientation of the structure;
         (b)   When the owner of a landmark structure intends to construct,

size, shape, and dimensions of the structure; the location and orientation of
the structure, on the lot, and the actual or proposed building setback lines.
In addition, the application shall be accompanied by a detailed, narrative
description of the proposed design or change of design, use of materials, and
orientation of the structure, including any exterior plumbing, mechanical, and
electrical appendages. Except in single-family residential zoning districts,
applications for structures to be constructed or remodeled, which remodeling
would increase or decrease the total gross building area by 50% or more, shall
be accompanied by a colored elevation showing at a minimum the design, use of
materials, and orientation of buildings. In addition, the Architectural Review
Board may require the submission of colored perspectives or architectural
renderings.
            2.   The application with materials indicated shall be received by
the Building Commissioner no less than 14 days prior to the next regularly
scheduled Architectural Review Board meeting. The Village Fiscal Officer shall

representative of the Building Department the day following the hearing. The
Board will determine by a vote of its members whether the application for a
certificate of appropriateness will be issued, provided all other requirements
for a building permit, if applicable, are met. If a decision of the Building
Commissioner regarding requirements of this chapter, other than §
151.075, is to be appealed to the Planning Commission, a certificate of
appropriateness must first be requested from the Architectural Review Board. If
a certificate of appropriateness is not approved, the Board shall return the
application and appended material to the applicant with a notice that the
certificate of appropriateness shall not be issued and listing in writing all
reasons why the applicant did not meet the criteria and standards set forth
herein. Such notice shall also be sent to the Planning Commission. The Board

following respects:
      (1)   Subdivision of land. Subdivision of land may be granted according
to provisions in §
151.041 and §
151.075(H)(2)(n); provided, that the proposed subdivision will be consistent
with the intent and purpose of this chapter and will not be materially
injurious to properties in the immediate vicinity.
      (2)   Signage variances. The Commission shall have the power to overturn
a decision of the Building Commissioner regarding signage requirements as set
forth in §§
151.125 through
151.133 under the circumstances found in either divisions (H)(2)(a) or (H)(2)
(b) below, and all the circumstances found in divisions (H)(2)(c) and (H)(2)(d)
below:
         (a)   When there is reasonable doubt as to any provision of this
chapter as applied to such property; or
         (b)   Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions apply
to the subject property that do not apply generally to other properties in the
village; and
         (c)   The authorization of such variance will not be materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the vicinity in
which the property is located; and
         (d)   The following design requirements are met.
            1.   For buildings which are parts of complexes involving several
buildings designed by the same architect to form a consistent, harmonious
entity, exterior paint or stain colors for all parts of the complex, including
signage, irrespective of diversity of ownership, shall be chosen which reflect
the character, style, and materials of the buildings.
            2.   Signage shall take into consideration exterior detail and
relationships, compatibility and appropriateness of design and details,
including all projecting and receding elements of the exterior, including, but
not limited to, porches, overhangs, and the horizontal or vertical expression
which is conveyed by these elements.
            3.   Any sign shall be of material and style harmonious to the
overall theme of the area.
      (3)   Property variances.
         (a)   The Commission shall have the power to grant a variation in the
property provisions and requirements of this chapter which will not be contrary
to the public interest or intent and purpose of this chapter, so that the
public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity, and general welfare
will be conserved and substantial justice done, but only where, owing to
special conditions pertaining to a specific piece of property, the strict
application of the provisions or requirements of this chapter would cause a
clearly demonstrable hardship.
         (b)   Variances may be granted under the following circumstances:
            1.   When there is reasonable doubt as to any provision of this
chapter or the building zone map as applied to such property; or
            2.   When the following facts and conditions exist:
               a.   An exceptional narrow, shallow, or irregular lot,
exceptional topographical conditions existing and of record June 27, 1941; or
               b.   Large "specimen" trees are in jeopardy; or
               c.    Where, by reason of extraordinary or exceptional
circumstances or conditions, the literal enforcement of the requirements of
this chapter would involve practical difficulty or would cause unnecessary
hardship, or would not carry out the spirit and purpose of this chapter; and
               d.   Such variance is necessary for the use and enjoyment of the
property in a manner similar to that which other property in the village is
used; and
               e.   The authorization of such variance will not be materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the vicinity in
which the property is located; and
               f.   That the condition or situation of the subject property, or
the intended use of the property, for which variance is sought, is not so
general or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably practical the formulation
of general regulations for such conditions or situation.
         (c)   In exercising any of the foregoing powers, the Commission may
impose such special conditions or requirements as it shall deem necessary or
desirable under the circumstances to reduce any adverse effect of any
permission or grant, on the character and development of the district in which
the specific property is located.
      (4)   Conditional use. The Commission shall have the power to hear,
decide, grant or deny applications for conditional uses in accordance with the
provisions found in §§
151.021(O) and
151.050.
         (a)   The granting of such application shall be made only if such
conditional use, exception, or modification:
            1.   Will not be materially detrimental or injurious to property in
the village;
            2.   Will be consistent with the predominant or prevailing district
land use, building and structure patterns, and the intent and purpose of this
chapter.
         (b)   The Commission may impose, in addition to the minimum
requirements and conditions specifically set forth for the conditional use,
exception, or modification in question such special conditions or requirements
as it shall deem necessary or desirable under the circumstances to reduce any
adverse effect on property in the vicinity, or on the character and development
of the district in which the specific property is located including:
            1.   Limitations on signs;
            2.   Limitations on building materials; or
            3.   Requirements for open spaces, screening, landscaping,
construction offenses and other barriers, shielding of floodlights, erection of
safety devices, location of vehicular entrances and exits, and surfacing of
roads and driveways.
         (c)   Such other requirements and conditions as may be necessary to:
            1.   Safeguard the public health, safety, convenience, and general
welfare;
            2.   Minimize the adverse impact of adjoining properties in the
district or vicinity; and
            3.   Protect and preserve the character, attractions and orderly
development of the district or vicinity.

USE REGULATIONS
§ 151.050 CONDITIONAL USE.
   Conditional use permits, exceptions in the use requirements of this chapter,
are required for all conditional uses and for the enlargement, alteration, or
extension of existing conditional uses (see §
151.021(D)). Heretofore, existing uses of a type requiring a conditional use
permit shall not be nonconforming uses but shall be deemed to have a
conditional use permit for the existing use; however, a conditional use permit
shall be required for any enlargement, alteration, or extension. Conditional
use permits are not transferable when there is a change in occupancy, either of
owner or tenant. An application for a conditional use permit shall include a
basic data package (see §
151.026) and be submitted to the Building Commissioner and reviewed by the

alterations or extensions to the exterior of any building situated on those
premises are made, a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to a use
more nearly conforming to the uses permitted, as specified by this chapter for

OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS
§ 151.075 HISTORIC DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to maintain a high standard of
community development and the principles of town planning, to protect and
preserve property, to promote the stability of property values, and to protect
real estate from impairment or destruction of value for the general community
welfare by regulating the exterior architectural characteristics of structures
throughout the hereinafter defined Historic District. The village was
designated as an Historic Village in the National Register of Historic Places
on July 24, 1979, identifying landmarks (see divisions (F) and (G) below and
district zoning map). The regulations of this section are imposed in addition
to those of the other zoning districts in which the structures reside.
   (B)   Objectives. The character of the village is directly linked to the
economic, social, historical, and cultural health and well-being of the
community. This section, therefor, establishes procedures to maintain the
historic character of the village and obtain the following objectives:
      (1)   To recognize and preserve the distinctive historical and
architectural character of this community which has been influenced by the
architecture of an earlier period;
      (2)   To regulate the exterior design, use of materials, and orientation
of all structures hereafter altered, constructed, reconstructed, erected,
enlarged, or remodeled in the hereinafter defined Historic District;
      (3)   To safeguard the village by preserving areas, places, sites,
buildings, structures, including signs, objects, and works of art which reflect
elements of the village’s cultural, social, economic, political, or
architectural heritage;
      (4)   To seek alternatives to demolition or incompatible alterations
within the Historic District and to landmarks before such acts are performed;
and
      (5)   It is the further intent of this section to discourage the
construction of new structures, including signs, on lots containing landmark
structures and the subdivision of lots containing landmark structures for the
construction of new structures in close proximity to any landmark structures.

development shall be considered as one parcel, regardless of the extent to
which the parcel is subdivided by interior streets.
      (2)   Compliance. All PUD developments shall comply with the regulations
of the State Basic Building Code, the Village Fire Code, all other applicable
codes, and this chapter specifically as follows.
         (a)   PUD uses and requirements. The uses and requirements within a
PUD shall be limited to the uses and requirements as specified by the district
use and requirements applicable to the district in which the development is
located (see §§ 151.060 through 151.065).
         (b)   Yard and building height requirements.
            1.   The maximum building height requirements are the same as those
set forth by the district in which the development is located.
            2.   Buildings erected on a planned unit development site shall not
be required to comply with the requirement specified in §
151.086(A) that specifies minimum areas for lots (see division (D below), “land
planning criteria”).
            3.   Planned unit developments are not required to adhere to the
yard specifications set forth in §
151.086(B) and (C) (see division (D) below, “land planning criteria”).
         (c)   Relation to regulations for historic structures, sites, and
districts. Whenever a PUD application is filed for a property wholly or
partially located within a historic site or district involving a historic
structure, the Architectural Review Board shall submit its recommendation to
the Planning Commission. In such cases, the provisions of this chapter where
not inconsistent with the provisions of §
151.075 shall apply.
      (3)   Relation to subdivision rules. It is intended that the provisions
of this section be in substantial agreement with Rules and Regulations
Governing the Subdivision of Land in Mariemont, Ohio; however, in the event of
any conflict, the provisions of this subchapter shall govern.
   (D)   Land planning criteria. The following planning criteria are
established to guide and to control the planning, development, and use of land
in the PUD.
      (1)   Building and use arrangements. The design and development criteria
set forth in this section are intended to provide considerable latitude and
freedom in order to encourage variety in the arrangement of uses and of the
location, bulk, and shape of buildings, open space, and landscape features.
Buildings and uses shall be arranged, designed, and located in order to screen
and preserve residential uses within or nearby the PUD from adverse effects of
nonresidential uses within or nearby the PUD. The buildings and uses may be
arranged in various groups, courts, sequences, or clusters, with open spaces
organized and related to the buildings in order to provide privacy, to form a
unified composition of buildings and space, and to maximize the peace and
tranquillity of the residential occupants of the PUD and the nearby area. The
following design standards shall be met in planned unit developments:
         (a)   Adjoining property in the village shall be protected from loss
of light, air, and view due to the proximity of the bulk or shape of buildings
in the PUD;
         (b)   Through skillful design, the usability and accessibility of open
spaces on adjoining lots shall be obtained, while privacy assured within
adjoining dwellings;
         (c)   Required yards and setbacks shall not be excessive so as to
prevent the reasonable development of open land for landscape features,
recreation, or other private uses; and
         (d)   Latitude in design shall apply to the planning of landscape
features such as walls, fences, hedges, and other features to create a variety
of common open spaces and private areas.
      (2)   Local circulation system. The vehicular circulation system and
parking facilities shall be designed to fully accommodate vehicular traffic
with safety and efficiency without allowing it to dominate and destroy the form
of the area. Driveways for group developments and local streets shall be
connected to major arterial and collector streets at locations where the
traffic can be controlled and operated effectively with the minimum
interference with the capacity of the major arterial and collector streets. The
amount of traffic generated by commercial uses passing through residential
areas shall be minimized.
      (3)   Topography and site appearance. It is a requirement that these
developments shall be designed to take advantage of the topography of the land
in order to utilize the natural contours, to economize on the construction of
utilities, to reduce the amount of grading, and to maximize the conservation of
trees and topsoil. The natural features and other distinctive characteristics
of the site shall be integrated into the plan to create functional variations
in the arrangements of buildings, open spaces, and site features.
      (4)   Utility services. Utility services in a development area shall be
entirely underground.
      (5)   Private land. In the planning of residential developments in a
variety of groups or clusters, undeveloped land, to the extent possible, may be
provided adjacent to the units for the outdoor use of the occupants.
      (6)   Common land. The common land shall be readily accessible to the
residential units and shall be usable as open space. The integrity of the
common land shall be guaranteed from further division or other changes through
deed restrictions or declarations of covenants by explicit prohibition of other
than the intended uses; these deed restrictions and covenants shall be exempt
from further amendment except upon prior approval by the Planning Commission.
      (7)   Unified boundary. The design at the development area boundary shall
be unified with the adjoining developments in the village. Within the
development area, parking areas, service areas, commercial areas, and other
features likely to have adverse effect on surrounding property shall be
screened against viewing from first-story residences in the village outside the
PUD.
      (8)   Development area. The minimum area to qualify as a PUD shall be not
less than five contiguous acres. A parcel or parcels of land with less acreage
may be considered for planned development when it is demonstrated that the
smaller area has a unique feature of geography, topography, or other
development aspect which is determined by the Planning Commission to be
appropriate for the district designation; however, contiguous property of less
than five acres may be added to a previously established PUD without any
demonstrated basis.
      (9)   Development area density. The overall density of a development area
shall conform to the basic overall density requirements of the standard
districts.
      (10)   Peripheral setbacks. Along the boundary of any PUD within the
village, each nonresidential building shall be set back at least 30 feet from
adjoining private property outside the PUD. Each residential building shall be
set back from adjoining residential buildings outside the PUD in the village in
accordance with the requirements for that district.
      (11)   Required open spaces. In any PUD, the total public or common space
shall be not less than 20% of the gross acreage of the PUD District. Common
open space shall be protected by recorded covenants and restrictions to assure
that such open space will be permanently preserved and maintained.
   (E)   Development procedure and regulations.
      (1)   Preliminary development plan. Subject to the requirements of this
subchapter, a developer shall submit to the Planning Commission a preliminary
plan of a development area by filing five copies with accompanying letter to
the Planning Commission. Plans may only be submitted on behalf of a single
owner of the parcel or a group of owners of the land included therein who are
acting jointly. The preliminary plan of the development area shall conform to
the specifications set forth in Division V of Rules and Regulations Governing
the subdivision of Land in Mariemont, Ohio, as revised January, Ord. O-1984,
the contents of which are incorporated by reference as part of this code of
ordinances as fully as if set out at length herein.
      (2)   Referral for review and reports.
         (a)   Upon receipt of a preliminary plan of a development area, the
Planning Commission shall transmit one copy each of the preliminary plan to the
Building Commissioner and Village Engineer for review, report, and
recommendation. The Planning Commission shall also transmit a copy of all
covenants, restrictions, and easements to be recorded and covenants for
maintenance to the Solicitor for his or her review, report, and recommendation.
The Planning Commission shall further transmit one copy of the preliminary plan
to the Metropolitan Sewer District and one copy to the Cincinnati Water Works,
and may transmit one copy to the Regional Planning Commission for review and
comments. The Building Commissioner, Village Engineer, and Solicitor shall each
within 30 days from receiving a preliminary plan of the development area,
unless otherwise extended with consent of the developer, provide and furnish to
the Planning Commission a report upon their respective jurisdictions with four
copies. Three copies of each report shall be filed with the Planning
Commission, and one copy filed with the Fiscal Officer of Council who shall
maintain such copy for public inspection.
         (b)   Within 60 days after a preliminary plan has been filed with the
Planning Commission, unless otherwise extended with consent of the developer,
the Planning Commission shall evaluate the plan and shall inform the developer
either that the preliminary plan complies with the regulations, standards, and
criteria prescribed by this chapter for planned unit development areas
applicable to the proposal, or a finding of any failure of such compliance, and
a recommendation that the preliminary plan be approved, disapproved, or
modified. If in any evaluation the Planning Commission finds that any
regulations, standards, or criteria prescribed by this chapter are inapplicable
because of unusual conditions of the development area, or the nature and
quality of the proposed design, it may recommend that an adjustment in such
regulations, standards, or criteria be made, and that special conditions be
required for the development, provided the adjustment or conditions will not be
in conflict with the promotion of the public health, safety, and general
welfare of residents of the village. The adjustments and conditions shall
constitute a part of the proposed preliminary plan.
         (c)   If approved, the Planning Commission shall request seven copies
of the preliminary plan from the developer, shall stamp them as tentatively
approved, and distribute one copy each, with letter certifying action, to the
regional Planning Commission, the Building Commissioner, Village Engineer,
Metropolitan Sewer District, Cincinnati Water Works, Planning Commission file,
and the developer.
         (d)   Following approval by the Planning Commission, the Planning
Commission shall notify the developer of such action by registered or certified
mail and authorize it to proceed with the preparation of the final development
plan, which shall be in accordance with the specifications set forth in
Division VI of Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in
Mariemont, Ohio, as revised January, 1984, the contents of which are
incorporated by reference. Within 15 days after mailing notice, unless the time
is extended, the developer shall deposit with the Village Fiscal Officer a cash
amount to be credited to the General Fund of the village, for the exclusive use
of covering expenses incurred by the village in reviewing the plan. These
expenses may include items such as the cost of professional services in
connection with reviewing the plan’s on-site inspection, the preparation of
reports, publication and mailing of public notice, if any, and any other
reasonable expenses directly attributable thereto. The cash amount shall be
determined by the Village Council according to statements rendered by the
professional rendering the service.
      (3)   Final development plan.
         (a)   The developer of any parcel or parcels of land for which a
preliminary plan has been approved by the Planning Commission, and who has
posted the inspection fee required in division (E)(2)(d) above, may submit a
final development plan. The final plan shall be filed with the Building
Commissioner who shall, upon payment of any appropriate fees which may be
required, submit the final plan to the Planning Commission within 15 days.
         (b)   If the Planning Commission finds that a proposed final plan of a
development area is in substantial compliance with and represents a detailed
expansion of the previously approved preliminary plan; that the final plan
complies with all of the conditions and adjustments which may have been imposed
in the approval of the preliminary plan; that the final plan is in accordance
with the design criteria and provisions which apply particularly to any plan of
a planned unit development; that all agreements, contracts, covenants, deed
restrictions, dedications, easements, declarations of ownership, and other
required documents are in acceptable form and have been executed; that
development, pursuant to the previously approved preliminary plan, is in
accordance with that plan; that all fee payments have been made and that the
provisions of the subdivision regulations have been met; the Commission shall
then approve and sign such final plan of a PUD.
         (c)   The Planning Commission shall instruct the developer to furnish
six copies of the approved final plan and shall transmit one copy each to the
Building Commissioner, Village Engineer, Metropolitan Sewer District, and
Cincinnati Water Works. One copy shall be retained for the Planning Commission
file, and one copy shall be added to the village base maps.
         (d)   Following the approval of a final plan of a development area,
the Building Commissioner shall be notified and zoning certificates and other
permits shall be issued immediately upon payment of the required fees.    
      (4)   Progressive development.
         (a)   A developer, having obtained Planning Commission approval of any
final plan of a development area, may accomplish the development in progressive
stages which are consistent with any conditions pertaining to progressive
stages of development contained in the final plan as approved.
         (b)   When the final plan of development area provides for partial
development of the total area for which a preliminary plan has been approved,
the Planning Commission may require inspections of the improvements then made,
or detailed plans for all improvements in the development area to permit
evaluation of the progress and conformance of development of the entire parcel
to the preliminary plan or a previously approved final plan before further or
partial development may be approved.
      (5)   Amendments to plan.
         (a)   At any time after the approval of a preliminary plan or a final
plan of a development area, the owner or owners, or developer representing the
owner or owners, may request an amendment of development plans; the request for
the amendment shall be filed with the Planning Commission.
         (b)   If the amendment, as determined by the Planning Commission,
represents a major departure from the intent or the substance of the
preliminary plan, the amendment shall then be subject to the same procedures
and conditions of approval as the original application. For purposes of this
section, a “major departure from the intent and substance of the preliminary
plan” shall include, but not be limited to, an increase in or relocation of
areas planned for a particular use, or the addition of a use not included in
the approved preliminary plan.
   (F)   Transfer of land from standard zoning to PUD unit.
      (1)   The Planning Commission, by its Chairperson, shall, within seven
days of receipt of a preliminary plan requiring modification of existing zoning
in the area of the planned unit development, notify the Fiscal Officer of
Council that a public hearing by Council is required pursuant to R.C. § 713.12.
      (2)   Land in an area being planned for transfer to a planned unit
development site shall be subject to all applicable provisions of this chapter
for that area until a notation is made to the village zone map reflecting the
area to be in a planned unit development in accordance with this section.
(2000 Code, § 151.077) (Ord. O-4-96, passed 3-25-1996)
§ 151.078 SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR ROW HOUSES AND OTHER MULTI-FAMILY DWELLINGS
EXISTING AS OF MARCH 1, 2003.
   (A)   Purpose. The village contains certain row houses and other multi-
family dwellings. In order to provide for property development and improvement
while protecting the historic and architectural features which exist, certain
row houses existing as of March 1, 2003, may be rezoned to single-family
attached dwelling units; provided, that such units comply with this chapter and
Building Code and with the following provisions. These provisions are intended
to permit these properties to be developed and conveyed in a more flexible
manner, without detriment to neighboring properties.
   (B)   Rezoning. The conversion of a row house or other multi-family dwelling
existing as of March 1, 2003, to single-family attached dwelling units requires
the prior approval of the Planning Commission. As a condition to approval, the
Planning Commission shall require all of the following:
      (1)   A plat of survey and an legal description of the property
reflecting the exact boundary lines of the parcels to be created by the
conversion, all easements encumbering the parcels and such other matters as may
be reasonably required by the Planning Commission. If a garage is located on a
re-surveyed lot, the garage shall be shown on the survey and must comply with
all applicable provisions of this chapter and the Building Code;
      (2)   Evidence that once the approval of the rezoning is complete the new
single-family residences will comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter; and
      (3)   Such other and further requirements as the Planning Commission may
deem necessary or appropriate. The applicant shall address party wall and
common boundary issues by way of a party wall and common facilities agreement
signed by the owners of all adjoining single-family, attached dwelling units.
Upon request, the Commission shall provide to applicants a sample party wall
and common facilities agreement which is acceptable to the Commission and the
village. If a shared garage or a garage having a party wall is included in a
parcel to be created by the conversion, the Commission further shall require
owners of the shared garage or the garage having a party wall to execute a
common facilities agreement for that purpose and will provide an acceptable
sample form.
   (C)   Residential buildings to front upon a dedicated street or other public
right-of-way; not to be moved to rear of existing buildings. No building or
part of a building designated for residential purposes shall hereafter be
erected or moved to the rear of any existing building. No building designed for
residential purposes shall hereafter be erected or altered unless the building
fronts upon a dedicated street or right-of-way dedicated for public use and
accepted by the village as a public right-of-way.
   (D)   Minimum street frontage. No lot shall contain any building used in
whole or in part for residential purposes unless at least an area not less than
the centerline dimension from party wall to party wall of the lot abuts a
public street. There shall be not more than one single-family dwelling on the
lot.
   (E)   Unobstructed frontage facing dedicated street; qualifying wall.
      (1)   No apartment, residence, home, or other designation of the abode
for one family shall have less than 16 feet of exterior wall frontage facing
the nearest dedicated street property line, so that no other building, portion
of a building, lot, or portion of a lot shall come between the wall and the
street.
      (2)   The minimum of 16 feet applies only where the wall is either
parallel to the adjacent street property line, on a curve, or parallel to a
chord which is at a 90 degree angle to and centers on the same radius that
bisects the proposed qualifying wall.
   (F)   No further accessory buildings. With respect to row houses and other
multi-family dwellings converted to single-family, attached dwelling units
pursuant to this section, no further accessory buildings, outbuildings, or
garages may be constructed or placed upon parcels after the conversion.
   (G)   Yard and lot requirements. Row houses and other multi-family dwellings
converted to single-family attached dwelling units pursuant to this section
shall not be required to comply with the yard specifications set forth in §
151.086(B) and (C), or with the minimum area lot specifications set forth in §
151.086(A).
(2000 Code, § 151.078) (Ord. O-8-03, passed 5-12-2003)
COURT, YARD, AND HEIGHT REGULATIONS
§ 151.085 BUILDING HEIGHT, YARD, AND COURT REGULATIONS.
   (A)   In the various districts there shall be provided on each lot a
“required side yard” along each side lot line, a “required rear yard”, and a
“required front yard”, the minimum dimensions of which shall be in accordance
with the following regulations and §
151.086, “tabulation and formulae”.
   (B)   The minimum dimensions of courts and the maximum height of principal
structures shall also be in accordance with said tables and regulations. The
side and rear yard setbacks, height, and size of accessory buildings, when
detached from the principal building, are set forth in division (B)(1)(c)
below. Attached dwelling units, such as condominiums and rowhouses, are
considered as single structures.
      (1)   Height, size and yard regulations for principal and accessory
buildings.
         (a)   Building height.
            1.   a.   The height of principal buildings shall be the mean
vertical distance from the average established grade in front of the lot, or
from the average natural grade at the building line, if higher, to the average
height of the top of the cornice of flat roofs, or to the deck line of a
mansard roof, or to the midheight of a pitched or hipped roof.
               b.   Where a lot faces on two or more streets or alleys of
different average established grades in front of the lot, the higher of the
grades shall control only for a depth of 120 feet perpendicularly back from the
street line of the higher street or alley.
               c.   On a corner lot the height is the mean vertical distance
from the average established grade or from the average natural grade at the
building line, if higher, on the street of greatest width, or if two or more
such streets are of the same width, from the higher of such grades.
               d.   Principal building does not include detached accessory
buildings (see division (B)(1)(c) below).
            2.   Public and semi-public buildings may be erected to a height
not exceeding 45 feet; provided, that the required front, side, and rear yards
required by §
151.086 are increased one additional foot for each two feet such building
exceeds 30 feet in height.
               3.   Chimneys, monumental towers, church steeples and towers,
monuments, domes, false mansards, and belfries may be erected to any height.
            4.   a.   Whenever hospitals, nursing, rest, convalescent homes, or
retirement communities located in Residence B District are to have a center
utilitarian unit to connect wings of such a building, such center unit may, in
order to provide relief from repetition of elements in design, be erected to a
height not exceeding 86 feet, exclusive of belfries, cupolas, domes,
ornamentation, chimneys, and flag poles; provided, that the ground area of such
center unit shall be not greater than one-sixth the ground area of the wings,
and that the total usable floor area of such center unit shall be not greater
than one-third of the total usable floor area of the wings.
               b.   Such height in excess of 45 feet shall not require any
increase in the front, side, or rear yards.
         (b)   Yard dimensions and regulations.
            1.   Front yard.
               a.   In any residential district, all structures shall have a
required front yard which is determined by multiplying the average width of the
area in front of the principal structure by the setback specified in §
151.086(B).
               b.   In any residential district, the alignment of an improved
property must conform to the average alignment of nearby buildings on the same
side of street(s) for a distance of 200 feet along its frontage (for a corner
lot the side is also required to conform to the average) within five feet.
               c.   For rounded or cul-de-sacs lots, alignment is calculated
based on the midpoint of the house frontage to the property line.
            2.   Rear yard. In any residential or business district, all
structures shall have a required rear yard which is determined by multiplying
the average width of the area in back of the principal structure by the setback
specified in §
151.086(B).
            3.   Side yard. In any residential or industrial district, all
structures shall have a required side yard setback as specified in §
151.086(C) (see also corner lots, in division (B)(1)(b)5. below).
            4.   Street-to-street lots. In any residential district where a lot
runs through the block from street to street, the required setback as defined
for front yards in division (B)(1)(b)1. above shall be provided on each street.
            5.   Corner lots. In any residential district on a corner lot, the
required width of the side yard setback along the side street shall be equal to
the required sum of the widths of the two side yards minus three feet, except
in division (B)(1)(b)1.b. above, where condition exists, such structure must
conform to the setback specified in division (B)(1)(b)1.b. above.
            6.   Lot area.
               a.   Within any residential district, as indicated on the
building zone map, every lot shall contain a lot area of not less than that
stipulated in §
151.086(A), “tabulation and formulae”.
               b.   The Planning Commission shall have the power where the
strict application of the requirements of minimum lot areas would result in
undue hardship upon the owner of specific property to reduce the total required
area by not more than 12.5% of such total area.
               c.   The provisions for a minimum lot area of 6,750 square feet
for single-family residence in Residence A, B, and C Districts shall not apply
to lots existing in duly recorded subdivisions, recorded in the County
Recorders office prior to April 23, 1942, or on any plat of subdivision, which
may have been, prior to April 23, 1942, submitted to the Commission and have
endorsed thereon the approval of the Planning Commission.
            7.   Lot width.
               a.   No residence shall be erected in a residential district on
a lot of less than 40 feet in width unless such lot is recorded on a plat of
subdivision in the office of the County Recorder as of April 23, 1942.
               b.   In such instances, the minimum side yard and total side
yards required shall be the same as required for a lot of 40 feet in width.
            8.   Minimum area, yards, and the like. The minimum area, yards,
and other open spaces required by this chapter shall also apply to structures
existing as of April 23, 1942.
            9.   Minimum yards. The minimum yards and other open spaces
required in this chapter for each and every building existing as of April 23,
1942, or for any building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall not
be encroached on or considered as yard or open space requirements for any other
building or structure regardless of any change in ownership of the land
included within those yards or other open spaces.
            10.   Minimum street frontage. Every lot in a residential district
shall have a minimum street frontage of 20 feet.
            11.   A panhandle shaped lot where a narrow strip that is less than
the full lot width is created that satisfies the minimum street frontage but
positions a new or existing residence behind another without direct line of
site of the public street is prohibited.
            12.   Attached garages cannot be the closest point of the principal
structure to the front facing property line. Front facing garages should not be
the predominant architectural feature of the residential facade.
         (c)   Height and yard regulations for accessory buildings.
            1.   a.   Accessory buildings shall not exceed 15 feet in total
height measured from the grade at front of the structure to the highest point
of roof, and shall be at least three feet from the rear lot line, and shall be
at least three feet from any side lot line, measured from the nearest point of
the accessory building to the rear lot line or side lot line as the case may
be.
               b.   The total height measured from the grade at the front of
the structure to the highest point of the roof may be increased one inch
vertically for each additional two inches horizontally that the side yard and
rear yard setbacks are increased beyond the three- foot minimum.
               c.   In no case shall the maximum height exceed 18 feet. In the
rear yard of a corner lot, no accessory building shall be built closer to the
street than the required front yard setback of either of the adjoining lots, in
no case less than 25 feet.
            2.   a.   An accessory building in a required rear yard used for
housing of motor vehicles used by the occupants of the property permitted under
§
151.060(A)(7)(b) shall not exceed in area more than 30% of such required rear
yard.
               b.   Accessory buildings used for storage purposes per §
151.060(A)(7)(b) shall not exceed in area more than 25% of such required rear
yard.
      (2)   Court regulations.
         (a)   Generally. A court shall be provided for any room in which
persons live, sleep, or work (except storage rooms) located in any residence
district or in a business district which cannot be reasonably and exclusively
lighted and ventilated as required in this chapter from a street yard.
         (b)   Minimum dimensions.
            1.   Inner court. The minimum length of any side of an inner court
shall be seven feet for each story of the building in which the court is
located.
            2.   Outer court. The minimum length of any side of an outer court
shall be six feet for each story of the building in which the court is located.
         (c)   Minimum area. The minimum area of an inner court or outer court
shall be not less than twice the square of the minimum length of any one side
required for the court.
         (d)   Courts in existence. Courts in existence at the effective date
(March 25, 1996) are permitted to continue, but new buildings must meet all
standards of the State Basic Building Code (including light and ventilation).

      (2)   Formulae. For lot values between or above the values on the
foregoing tabulation the following formulae shall be used to determine width of
total side yards.
 
   - 0 to 18 feet         Total side yard equals .00125W2 plus 11 feet
   - 18 plus to 30 feet      Total side yard equals 1.1 (.00125W 2 plus 11 feet)
   - Over 30 feet         Total side yard equals 1.2 (.00125W 2 plus 11 feet)
               (W = total width of lot)
 
      (3)   Width. For least width of any side yard on lot widths between or
above values on the above tabulation, such widths shall be determined by
interpolation or extrapolation.
      (4)   Precedence. Combinations of business and residences, residence
district restriction govern.

employed at any one period during the day or night.
   (H)   Collective parking provisions shall be as follows.
      (1)   Collective provisions of off-street parking facilities for two or
more buildings or uses are permitted; provided, that the total of such off-
street parking facilities, collectively, shall be not less than 85% of the sum
of the requirements for the various individual uses computed separately in
accordance with division (G) above.
      (2)   Not more than 50% of the off-street parking facilities required by
this chapter for establishments whose peak hours of operation do not normally
coincide may be supplied by contiguous off- street parking facilities: such as,
theaters; churches; bowling alleys; dance halls; and establishments for the
sale and consumption on the premises of alcoholic beverages, food, or
refreshments whose normal peak usage differs from business offices, retail
stores, personal service shops, household equipment or furniture shops, and
manufacturing buildings and similar uses.
   (I)   Additional requirements shall be as follows.
      (1)   (a)   The off-street parking facilities required for dwellings

between the nearest point of the off-street parking facilities and the nearest
point of the building.
      (2)   Where by reason of the operation of this chapter, off-street
parking is required of any use in a residential zone and there is insufficient
area in such residential zone to meet the requirements of this chapter in such
zone, and property under the same ownership contiguous thereto is available for
off-street parking, whether or not such area is in the same residential zone,
such contiguous property may be used for off-street parking in order to meet
the requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   When units or measurements determining the number of required
parking spaces result in requirement of a fractional space, any fraction up to
and including one-half shall be disregarded and fractions over one-half shall
require one parking space.
      (4)   In the case of a use not specifically mentioned, the requirements
for off-street parking facilities for a use which is similar shall apply.
      (5)   Off-street parking facilities for one use shall not be considered
as providing required parking facilities for any other use except as herein
specified for collective use (see division (H) above).
      (6)   The off-street parking facilities required by this chapter may be
provided by premises which are either under the same owners as the building or
other structure for which the off-street parking facilities are provided, or by
premises under other ownership; provided, that if the premises are under such
other ownership, that provision of off-street parking must be evidenced by
written contract by a lease or easement recorded by the County Recorder.
      (7)   Where parking facilities have been established prior to the passage
of this chapter, or subsequent to the passage of this chapter in compliance
with the terms hereof, that entire area of parking facilities shall be
maintained by the owner thereof so as to be usable for such purpose, and that
parking area shall not thereafter be reduced so long as the uses of such owner,
owner lessees, tenants, or licensees shall continue, and such area shall
thereafter be encroached on by any building or other structure.
      (8)   Wherever parking areas are to be used during darkness, a system of
lighting may be installed to provide an adequate standard of five foot-candles
of illumination over the entire parking areas. All floodlights shall be
shielded so as to reflect light away from all premises and shall not create
more than one-half foot- candles of illumination to abutting residential
districts.
      (9)   Any parking area open to the public shall be maintained in a manner
to keep it as free as practicable from dust, paper, and other loose particles,
and snow and ice shall be promptly removed by the operator. All signs and
markers used to indicate direction of traffic movement and location of
physically handicapped and other special parking spaces shall be maintained in
a neat and legible condition. Likewise, any walls, trees, shrubbery, and
surfacing of the parking spaces and approach drives shall be maintained in good
condition throughout. The Building Commissioner shall have the authority to
prohibit the use of the area for parking purposes unless and until proper
maintenance, repair, or rehabilitation is completed.
      (10)   At least 5% of any parking area open to the public shall be
devoted to landscaped space. Trees and shrubs shall be placed and maintained to
substantially screen all off-street parking areas from the view of adjoining

      (5)   Standards for review. The design requirements for cellular or
wireless communications antennas and towers: the following standards shall
apply to all cellular or wireless communications antennas and towers:
         (a)   Placement and co-location.
            1.   The cellular or wireless communications company shall
demonstrate, using the latest technological evidence, why the antenna or tower
must be placed in a proposed location in order to serve its necessary function
in the company’s grid system. Part of this demonstration shall include a
drawing showing the boundaries of the area around the proposed location which
would probably also permit the antenna to function properly in the company’s
grid system. This area shall be considered the allowable zone.
            2.   If the communications company proposes to build a cellular or
wireless communications tower (as opposed to mounting the antenna on an
existing structure), it is required to demonstrate that it has contacted the
owners of nearby “tall structures” within the allowable zone, asked for
permission to install the cellular communications antenna on those structures,
and was denied for either non-economic reasons or that a clearly unreasonably
economic demand was not made by the owner, based on prevailing market values.
“Tall structures” shall include, but not be limited to, smoke stacks, water
towers, buildings over 35 feet in height, antenna support structures, or other
structures or other cellular or wireless communication companies, other
communication towers.
            3.   In order to limit and reduce the number of antenna support
structures needed in the village in the future, the owner of an existing
cellular or wireless communications tower shall not unreasonably deny a request
to accommodate other uses, including other cellular or wireless communications
companies, and the antenna of local police, fire, ambulance departments, the
owner of the existing cellular or wireless communications tower may request
reasonable compensation for the use of the tower.
            4.   For the purpose of encouraging co-location of cellular or
wireless antenna and other uses, cellular or wireless communication towers
shall be designed, engineered, and constructed as follows, unless waived for
good cause to minimize impact on adjoining property by the Mayor:
               a.   Towers less than 75 feet tall shall be designed,
engineered, and constructed to support antennas installed by one or more
cellular or wireless communications servers;
               b.   Towers more than 75 feet in height but less than 150 feet
shall be designed, engineered and constructed to support antennas installed by
two or more wireless communication service users; and
               c.   Towers 150 feet in height or taller shall be designed,
engineered, and constructed to support antennas installed by three or more
cellular or wireless communications service users.
            5.   In addition, an applicant must demonstrate that the area
acquired by lease or otherwise acquired for the use and construction of the
cellular tower and accessory structures is sufficient in size and structural
strength to accommodate such tower and any additional structures that may be
required if additional users are added to the tower.
            6.   As used in (C)(5)(a)5. above, the term USERS shall include the
antennas of Police, Fire, and Ambulance Departments.
            7.   The village may deny the application to construct a new
cellular or wireless communications tower if the applicant has not made a good
faith effort to mount the antenna on existing structures.
         (b)   Antenna tower height. The applicant shall demonstrate that the
antenna/tower is no higher than necessary to function satisfactorily and to
accommodate the co-location requirements as set out in (C)(5)(a) above. No
antenna that is taller than the necessary height shall be approved. Cellular or
wireless communications towers shall be exempt from the maximum height
requirements contained in §
151.085. Cellular towers shall be monopole construction unless it is
demonstrated that another type of tower is required for safety purposes.
         (c)   Setbacks from the base of the tower. If a new cellular or
wireless tower is to be constructed in an industrial zoning district, the
minimum distance between the base of the tower or any guy wire anchors and any
property line which abuts a zoning district other than a residential district
shall be no lower than the greater of the following:
            1.   Forty percent of the tower height;
            2.   Fifty feet; and
            3.   In no case shall the base of the tower be located less than
the height of the tower above grade plus 40 feet from any adjacent structures.
         (d)   Cellular or wireless communications tower safety. All cellular
or wireless communications towers shall be fitted with anti-climbing devices as
approved by manufacturers. Furthermore, the applicant shall demonstrate that
the proposed cellular or wireless communications tower and its antenna are safe
and that the surrounding properties will not be negatively affected by tower
failure, falling ice, nor other debris, electromagnetic fields or radio
frequency interference; however, if a specific safety issue in question is
determined to be regulated by either FCC regulations or applicable Building
Code regulations, and the operation or construction is in compliance with such
regulations, then this requirement for safety shall be deemed to have been met.
Subsequent to the installation of a cellular or wireless communications tower
site, if it is determined by the Village Council, upon presentation of proper
and sufficient documentation, and after a public hearing, that the operation of
a cellular or wireless communications tower is inherently dangerous or is a
demonstrable health hazard, the cellular or wireless communications tower shall
be declared to be a nuisance and all operation shall cease. The tower or
antenna shall also be removed as
provided under division (C)(7) below; however, no order of removal shall be
made if it is inconsistent with existing FCC Regulations.
         (e)   Fencing. A fence shall be required around the cellular or
wireless communications tower and its support structure(s) unless the antenna
is mounted on an existing structure. The fence shall be eight feet in height
and shall be erected to prevent access to non- authorized personnel.

the Planning Commission, shall be provided to screen as much of the support
structure and ground level features as is possible, and such landscaping shall
be maintained. In addition, existing vegetation on and around the site shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
         (g)   Licensing. The communications company must demonstrate to the
village that it is licensed by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC). The
owner of the tower must also annually provide to the village on January 1 of
each year a list of all users of the tower and each user shall provide the
village with a copy of each users license with the FCC. No approval will be
granted to any applicant unless proof of current FCC license for the proposed
use of the tower is provided.
         (h)   Required parking. If the cellular or wireless communication site
is fully automated, adequate parking shall be required for maintenance workers.
If the site is not fully automated, the number of parking spaces shall equal
the number of employees working on the largest shift. All parking
specifications and requirements shall be consistent with the applicable parking
requirements as established in this chapter.
         (i)   Appearance. Cellular or wireless communications towers under 200
feet in height shall be painted silver or have a galvanized finish retained in
order to reduce visual impact. Cellular or wireless communications towers shall
meet all Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. No cellular or

approved in compliance with the standards and criteria of this section and
shall include:
      (1)   A landscape plan or design illustrating the location of planned
synthetic grassed areas and abutting natural areas. All landscaping feature
including trees and shrubs must be located. A plan for drainage of the
synthetic grassed areas must also be included. A typical cross section details
on the compacted base design must be provided.
      (2)   Complete specifications on all materials to be used for the
synthetic grass installation, not limited to the turf, infill material, joining
material (adhesive, tape), border, and compacted base must be provided.
      (3)   Qualifications or certifications of the contractor or installer.
   (E)   Design and performance standards.
      (1)   The compacted base underneath the synthetic grass needs to be
designed in a manner to allow water to naturally permeate into the sub-surface
and not to pool or noticeably run-off into a public storm sewer or right-of-
way. Additional drainage scope may be required to properly discharge the water
from the synthetic grassed areas into or directed to a storm sewer.
      (2)   The color of the synthetic grass needs to simulate the appearance
of natural grass in the surrounding area during summer months. No permanent
paintings or markings of the synthetic grass is allowed.
      (3)   Seams must not be easily visible and grain must be consistent
between synthetic grass areas. Seams can be taped or glued, but not sewn.
      (4)   Synthetic grass must be affixed to a permeable backing with punched
holes to allow for proper drainage of rain water.
      (5)   Synthetic grass must have a minimum face weight of 60 ounces per
square yard.
      (6)   Synthetic grass must come with a minimum 12 year no-fade guarantee,
contain no lead, and of polyethylene, polypropylene, or nylon composition. Any
alternate synthetic grass will require approval from the Building Department
prior to installation or be subject to removal.
      (7)   Synthetic grass height must be between 1.75 and 2.25-inches tall.
Putting greens are considered a sports-field and subject to different zoning
requirements.
      (8)   In-fill medium must be a clean coated sand product (non-organic)
brushed into the fibers to keep them upright and provide ballast to avoid
movement. Any deviations of in-fill materials must be approved by the Building
Department prior to use or be subject to removal.
   (F)   Fees. A fee for synthetic grass permits shall be $120. Permit costs
for patios, decks, or other accessory structures that may be on the landscape
plan or design will be permitted separately.
   (G)   Required maintenance.
      (1)   Synthetic grass must be properly maintained. Failure to do so can
result in a notice of violation for improper maintenance. Some of the most
common maintenance items include:
         (a)   Weeds. No weeds or organic matter can be visible thru sections
of synthetic grass or along the seams or edges. Proper installation of a
compacted based and correct infill materials will reduce the likelihood of
unwanted weeds.
         (b)   Pooling. Water cannot puddle or pool on the surface. Proper
installation and grading of the compacted based and possible auxiliary surface
drains will reduce the likelihood of pooling.
         (c)   Public utility access. Synthetic grass can only be installed on
your property and not in the public right-of-way or utility easements. Any
damaged caused by public utilities repairing or maintaining service to your
house is the homeowner's responsibility.
         (d)   Animal feces and urine. Clean-up from pets must be done in a
timely manner. Odors emanating from urine or feces must be controlled and the
occasional sanitizing or cleansing of the synthetic grass may be required.
      (2)   Product has reached its lifespan. Due to wear and tear, UV ray
exposure, and general weathering, the product may require partial or complete
replacement. Factors for evaluating the lifespan include the condition of the
individual blades, seam quality, and color of the synthetic grass. If the
product has reached the end of its guaranteed lifespan as noted in the
manufacturer's literature, or if maintenance issues are not corrected in a
timely manner, the Building Department can deem the product beyond its lifespan
and require the synthetic grass to be replaced or that the original yard must
be restored to pre-synthetic grass conditions.

§ 152.01 CONDITIONAL RENTAL PERMIT OR RENTAL PERMIT.
   (A)   No owner of residential real property located within the village shall
rent to new tenants, any dwelling or dwelling unit in such real property for
any form of consideration, vacant as of January 1, 2022, unless he or she holds
a valid conditional rental permit or rental permit issued by the office of the
Building Department in the name of the owner and for the specific dwelling or
dwelling unit for rent, pursuant to an inspection to be made by the Building
Department.
   (B)   If the owner, occupant, or agent thereof does not consent to the
proposed inspection, the code official may appear before any judge in a court
of competent jurisdiction and seek an administrative search warrant to allow an
inspection. Any such application shall be made within ten calendar days after
the non-consent. The application for the warrant shall specify the basis upon
which the warrant is being sought and shall include a statement that the
inspection will be limited to a determination whether there are violations of
the code provisions identified in this section. The court may consider any of
the following factors along with such other matters as it deems pertinent in
its decision as to whether a warrant shall be issued:
      (1)   Eyewitness account of violation;
      (2)   Citizen complaints;
      (3)   Tenant complaints;
      (4)   Plain view violations;
      (5)   Violations apparent from city records;
      (6)   Property deterioration;
      (7)   Age of property;
      (8)   Nature of alleged violation;
      (9)   Condition of similar properties in the area;
      (10)   Documented violations on similar properties in the area;
      (11)   Passage of time since last inspection;
      (12)   Previous violations on the property.
   (C)   If a warrant is issued, no owner, occupant, or agent thereof shall
fail or neglect, upon presentation of a warrant, to properly permit entry
therein by the code official or his/her duly authorized designee for the
purpose of conducting a rental inspection and examination pursuant to this
section and consistent with the terms of the warrant. If the court declines to
issue a warrant, or if no warrant is sought, the rental inspection shall still
take place but the scope thereof shall be limited to such areas as are in plain
view. A limited-scope rental inspection conducted pursuant to this paragraph
shall be considered a "rental inspection" for purposes of Chapter 152 and all
other provisions of the rental inspection program set forth in this section.
(Ord. O-2-07, passed 2-12-2007; Ord. O-15-22, passed 5-23-2022)
§ 152.02 PERMIT VALIDITY.
   (A)   A rental permit shall be valid for three years from issuance. For
rental permit renewals, the length of validity of a rental permit will be based
upon results of the "rental condition inspection for occupancy checklist" at
the time of renewal. If there are five or fewer infractions noted on the
"rental condition inspection for occupancy checklist" and none of the
infractions are a "life safety" issue, a rental permit extension of five years
will be granted after any noted deficiencies are corrected. If more than five
infractions are noted or any "life safety" issues noted, a rental permit
extension of three years will be granted after any noted deficiencies are
corrected.
   (B)   A conditional rental permit shall be valid for 30 days. An extension
may be granted if the landlord/owner demonstrates a good faith effort to
address the inspection violations and provides documentation and a projected
schedule for the correction of noted deficiencies. This does not apply to any
life safety issues and an extension may not exceed 90 days.
   (C)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a dwelling or dwelling unit shall be
required to be inspected if written complaints about the condition of the
dwelling or dwelling unit have been filed with the Village Building Department
by any tenant. The standard "rental condition inspection for occupancy
checklist" developed by the Building Department shall form the basis for the
inspection. The inspection fee shall be paid by the tenant.
(Ord. O-2-07, passed 2-12-2007; Ord. O-15-22, passed 5-23-2022)
§ 152.03 WRITTEN APPLICATION.
   An owner shall apply for a rental permit by filing a written application
with the office of the Building Department which contains the following
information:
   (A)   Name of owner;
   (B)   Address of owner;
   (C)   Address of property to be inspected; and
   (D)   Name of tenant (if known at time of inspection).
(Ord. O-2-07, passed 2-12-2007; Ord. O-15-22, passed 5-23-2022)

dwelling unit by the Building Department or his or her designee within five
business days of receipt of the application for inspection.
   (B)   The Building Department or designee shall inspect the dwelling for
compliance with "International Property Maintenance Code (IPMC) 2021,"
including any and all future updates and amendments, using the Building
Department's "rental condition inspection for occupancy checklist. The owner
(or his or her representatives) shall be in attendance at this inspection.

§ 152.05 APPLICATION FEE.
   The owner shall pay an application fee of $80. The application fee shall
accompany the application. In the event that deficiencies are noted, a follow-
up re-inspection may be necessary and an additional fee of $60 will be charged.
No inspections will be conducted until all fees are paid in full. If a property
owner or a management company can arrange to have, several rental units
inspected at the same time, the initial inspection fees of $80 will be reduced
as follows: 20% for two to four units and 40% for five plus units. If for the
convenience of the tenant or property owner an inspection is conducted within
the valid rental permit period, the inspection fees will be prorated
accordingly.

the Building Official is unable to certify that the dwelling or dwelling unit
for which a rental permit is sought conforms to the requirements of this
chapter or the rules, regulations, and ordinances in the "rental condition
inspection for occupancy checklist," the office of the Building Department may,
when the nonconformity in his or her opinion does not constitute an immediate
threat or danger to the health, safety, or public welfare of the community or
the inhabitants or potential inhabitants of the dwelling or dwelling unit,
issue a conditional rental permit to the applicant. The office of the Building
Department shall not grant a conditional rental permit if the dwelling or
dwelling unit constitutes an immediate threat or danger to the health, safety,
or public welfare of the community of the inhabitants or potential inhabitants
of the dwelling or dwelling unit.
   (B)   A conditional rental permit shall set forth the reasons why the
dwelling or dwelling unit does not conform to this chapter and the condition
for occupancy checklist. The time for the owner to secure conformity shall not
exceed 30 days.

§ 153.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   These rules and regulations shall be made a part of the specifications
for any and all projects in which the opening of the surface or the tunneling
of a public way is involved. They shall also be embodied in the proposal for
submitting bids on contracts, and in the formal contract, and the contractor
shall be required to perform all work covered by these rules and regulations in
strict accordance therewith.
   (B)   In performing work under these specifications, the permittee is fully
responsible that his or her operations conform to all applicable statutes,
rules, or regulations of the village and the state.
(2000 Code, § 153.01) (Ord. O-23-81, passed 10-26-1981)
§ 153.02 APPLICATIONS AND PERMITS.
   (A)   Street opening permits are issued by the Building Commissioner.
Applications and permits shall be on forms and provided by the village.
   (B)   The application shall give the location and dimensions of the proposed
opening, the purpose for which the opening is to be made, the kind of pavement
or surface to be opened, and the approximate date that the opening will be
made. The period of time allowed for closing an opening will be governed by the
size and nature of the opening. If the work is not completed within the time
designated on the permit, the permit may be cancelled and a cancellation charge
of $4 applied.
   (C)   If the work has been started but not completed within the time
allowed, the permit may be cancelled. If cancelled, a cancellation charge, plus
all accrued restoration charges shall be paid by the permittee.
   (D)   Before the work can proceed, a new permit must be secured under the
same procedure as required in starting a new job.
   (E)   All applications for mains, conduits, manholes, and other major
subsurface structures shall be accompanied by a plan and typical cross section
showing, as nearly as possible from records available, the location of the
existing underground structures and the location of the proposed structure.
Plans shall be submitted in triplicate. See sample drawings in Appendix A. The
issuance of a permit will be based on the approved plans. No work which
deviates from an approved plan shall be performed unless and until an approval
of the change of plan has been secured from the Building Commissioner.
(2000 Code, § 153.02) (Ord. O-23-81, passed 10-26-1981)
§ 153.03 DEPOSIT OR SECURITY FOR PAYMENT.
   (A)   Restoration of pavement or payment of the cost thereof must be assured
in one of the following ways:
      (1)   The applicant has made a cash deposit equal to the estimated charge
for restoration at schedule prices;
      (2)   The applicant is operating under a contract with the village
involving the opening of public ways, in which case he or she may obtain a
street opening permit without cash deposit, but all restoration charges shall
be paid on completion of the contract work and prior to payment to the
contractor of the final estimate of money;
      (3)   In the event that the contractor fails to keep the restoration work
fully apace with the trench work, the permit may be cancelled and the
contractor required to make the deposits as specified in division (A)(1) above.
In the case of large contracts involving long trenches, the contractor shall
pay promptly any partial billing of restoration charges. The village reserves
the right to withhold any or all unpaid restoration charges from any funds due
the contractor;
      (4)   The applicant is a village or county department whose functions
require the installation or maintenance of underground structures; and
      (5)   The applicant is a public utility corporation whose franchise
empowers it to make its own paving restoration, but such permits will be issued
only when the restoration work keeps fully apace with the openings being made.
Such corporations shall pay promptly all bills for inspection at scheduled
rates, and all bills for restoration done by village forces.
   (B)   If at any time during the course of the work it appears that the cash
on deposit is inadequate to cover the cost of restoration, an additional sum
shall be deposited by the permittee in an amount equal to the difference
between the deposit and the revised estimate of charge.
   (C)   Where the contractor makes his or her own restoration, or operation is
of unusual size or difficulty, the village reserves the right to assign an
inspector to control street opening or street restoration. In such cases, the
permittee shall bear the entire cost of such inspection and shall deposit with
the village the estimated amount of such inspection in advance. If
underestimated, the permittee shall advance additional funds.
(2000 Code, § 153.03) (Ord. O-23-81, passed 10-26-1981)
§ 153.04 INSTALLATION OF SEWER BRANCHES AND WATER SERVICE BRANCHES BY CONTRACT.
   Where the village enters into a contract providing for the installation of
sewers or sewer branches, or for the installation of water mains or water
service branches, the contractor shall obtain the necessary permits as provided
in §
153.03(A)(2).
(2000 Code, § 153.04) (Ord. O-23-81, passed 10-26-1981)
§ 153.05 INTERFERENCE WITH VEHICULAR TRAFFIC.
   (A)   The permittee shall carry on the work authorized by the permit in such
manner as to cause a minimum of interference with traffic. He or she shall
provide adequate warning signs and devices to warn and guide traffic, and shall
place the signs and warning devices in a position of maximum effectiveness.
   (B)   The minimum requirement for warning signs when necessary shall be a
set of advance warning signs placed on all primary approaches to the work, at a
minimum distance of 400 feet, but as required by best visibility; sufficient
signs and markers in the immediate vicinity of the job shall also be
maintained.
   (C)   Where difficult or potentially hazardous conditions exist, competent
flagpersons shall be provided to effect a safe and orderly movement of traffic.
Where insufficient traffic lanes exist because of street openings, adequate
bridging shall be supplied by the contractor. When traffic congestion occurs in
spite of all precautions, the contractor shall be responsible for requesting
police assistance.
   (D)   On main thoroughfares and in congested districts, sufficient traffic
lanes shall be kept open at all times to permit substantially normal traffic.
Unless this can be accomplished, work shall be done only during the period
between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., or between midnight and 7:00 a.m. as directed
by the Chief of Police.
   (E)   In case of an emergency occurring in any important thoroughfare, the
permittee must notify the Police and Fire Departments immediately.
(2000 Code, § 153.05) (Ord. O-23-81, passed 10-26-1981)
§ 153.06 TRENCHING; BACKFILLING; TUNNELING.
   (A)   Trenching.
      (1)   Whenever culverts, sewers, manholes, valve chambers, catch basin
connections, water mains, gas pipe, or electric conduits, or house connections
thereto, or any type of subsurface facilities are exposed in excavating, the
permittee shall, at his or her own expense, protect them from damage.
      (2)   In all cases where an opening is to be located under or near any
railroad track, or in any way jeopardizes the safe operation of railroad
equipment or any subsurface facility, the permittee shall notify the owner or
operator thereof sufficiently in advance of the date on which opening is to be
made. The entire cost of supporting and maintaining tracks or other facility
and the entire cost of services necessary for safe operation of railroad
equipment, shall be borne by the permittee. No obstructions of any nature shall
be placed on tracks.
      (3)   The permittee shall use all necessary precautions to protect
persons or property from injury or damage. Barricades and sufficient warning
lights shall be placed along the opening. Flagpersons shall be provided by the
permittee if considered necessary by the Chief of Police.
      (4)   The length, width, and location of the trench, also the manner in
which the work is done, shall be acceptable to the Village Engineer. Every
precaution shall be taken to safeguard the work, and to inconvenience the
public as little as possible.
      (5)   The permittee shall carefully remove the paving and base course
materials and store them in piles separated from the excavated earth. Excavated
material shall be placed so as not to obstruct gutters or drains and in such
manner as will cause minimum inconvenience to the public. If necessary,
temporary covers for gutters shall be installed to ensure adequate drainage. In
special cases, it may be necessary to haul part or all of the excavated
material from the street.
      (6)   Openings shall be properly sheeted and braced where necessary, to
prevent caving, slipping, or cracking of sides. Sheeting and bracing, used to
support the sides of the opening, shall be carefully removed as the backfilling
of the trench progresses, but if considered by the Village Engineer necessary
for the protection of the banks, the sheeting and bracing shall be cut off two
feet below the surface of the subgrade and left in place. If pavement along the
sides of the opening is or becomes undermined and unsupported, the permittee
shall, at his or her own cost and expense, break down and remove such
undermined pavement and the foundation thereof, and shall also remove all loose
earth and replace with earth properly compacted in the manner provided under
division (B) below.
   (B)   Backfilling.
      (1)   Unless the Village Engineer elects alternate methods A or B in
divisions (B)(5) and (B)(6) below, backfill shall be made with material
excavated from the trench, except under no condition will soil with an
excessive amount of clay, frozen lumps, or other unstable substances be used as
backfill. Alternate method A will be required at all important intersections
and certain other special locations, as for example, where insufficient
clearances exist between structures, preventing proper and expeditious
compaction of the backfill.
      (2)   After the pipe or conduit has been placed, approved backfill
material, free from rock, shall be placed in four-inch layers thoroughly tamped
by mechanical means to a plane at least six inches above the top of the
structure. Backfill above the level of six inches above the top of the
structure shall be deposited uniformly and brought up gradually in layers not
exceeding five feet in thickness. Each layer of backfill shall be compacted by
the use of water jets at least one and one-quarter inch inside diameter and of
sufficient length to extend to the bottom of the backfill layer. The jet shall
be operated with a water pressure of at least 40 pounds per square inch and in
such a manner as to permeate the backfill thoroughly.
      (3)   Flooding may be used instead of jetting, in which case each layer
shall be compacted by thorough flooding with water. During flooding, the water
shall be allowed to flow slowly to the trench from high points and shall be
worked down to the full depth of the backfill later by bars. All bars shall be
long enough to extend entirely through the layer being filled. They shall be
forced down through the loose backfill material and as withdrawn, the water
allowed to flow down and around the bar. Sufficient hose shall be provided in
order to apply water to the trench at intervals not to exceed 100 feet.
      (4)   When alternate backfill methods A or B in divisions (B)(5) and (B)
(6) below are used, the permittee may elect to make immediate permanent
restoration and will not be required to make temporary restoration as specified
in §
153.07.
      (5)   In alternate backfill method A, the backfill above six inches above
the top of the structure shall consist of a well-graded bank run gravel with
the top size not exceeding three inches in its largest dimension, and
containing not over 20% silt. The bank run gravel shall be brought to a plane
parallel to and uniform 24 inches below the finished pavement and thoroughly
compacted by flooding with water. During flooding, water shall be allowed to
flow slowly into the trench from high points. Sufficient hose shall be provided
in order to apply water to the trench at intervals not to exceed 100 feet.
      (6)   In alternate backfill method B, the backfill above six inches above
the top of the structure shall consist of the original excavated earth backfill
in horizontal layers not exceeding six inches in depth before compaction. Each
layer shall be thoroughly compacted by approved power tamping equipment and
methods. In single isolated cuts, hand tamping may be substituted for power
tamping but backfill materials shall be placed in horizontal layers not
exceeding four inches in depth before compaction and each layer thoroughly
compacted.
   (C)   Tunneling.
      (1)   Tunneling is often necessary where pipe or conduit passes under
curb, or underground facilities. The permittee shall not do any tunneling
except by permission of the Village Engineer. Where tunneling has been resorted
to, the permittee shall bed the pipe or conduit as specified under division (B)
above. The remainder of the space from top of this fill to the roof of the
tunnel shall be completely filled with l:4:8 concrete of suitable consistency,
thoroughly tamped to fill the entire space, and to afford a rigid support for
the tunnel roof for its entire area. The complete backfilling of a tunnel shall
be performed under the supervision of a Village Inspector. The permittee shall
notify the Col. Donald L. Shanks Municipal Building not less than 24 hours in
advance of the date that such backfilling is to start.
      (2)   In the installation of small service pipes, it is suggested that
the pipe be jacked through or that a hole of sufficient size be bored. In such
cases, charge for inspection and issuance of permit only will be made for that
portion of street over services so installed.
(2000 Code, § 153.06) (Ord. O-23-81, passed 10-26-1981)
§ 153.07 TEMPORARY RESTORATION.
   (A)   When alternate backfill methods A or B in §
153.06(B)(5) and (B)(6) are satisfactorily followed, the permittee may elect to
perform permanent restoration immediately, in which case no temporary
restoration will be required.
   (B)   Where standard backfilling operations, as described in §
153.06, are followed, or where satisfactory backfill compaction is not obtained
with alternate backfill methods A or B in §
153.06(B)(5) and (B)(6), the permittee shall provide a temporary pavement and
maintain it until the permanent restoration is made. This temporary pavement
may, in some cases, be accomplished by carefully replacing the old paving
materials on the compacted backfill in the same order they occupied before
removal. The top surface shall be neatly replaced with the interstices filled
and leveled with fine dry material and with a crown of not to exceed one inch
above the adjoining pavement. Loose material, which may be scattered over the
pavement by traffic, will not be considered proper temporary restoration.
   (C)   When opening lies within a traffic lane, the permittee shall provide a
temporary bituminous concrete surface.
(2000 Code, § 153.07) (Ord. O-23-81, passed 10-26-1981)
§ 153.08 METHODS, MATERIALS, AND EQUIPMENT USED IN MAKING RESTORATION.
   Methods, materials, and equipment used in making restoration shall conform
to the current edition of the State Department of Transportation Construction
and Material Specifications insofar as they are applicable. On request of the
Village Engineer, a permittee making his or her own restoration shall furnish
to the village a full report of laboratory tests of any or all materials used
for restoration. Tests shall be made by a competent testing laboratory. All
sample and testing costs shall be paid by the permittee. On concrete pavement
or concrete base, the permittee shall pay the cost of procuring and testing
cylinders. These cylinders shall be taken and tested by technicians of the
laboratory, at least two cylinders for every 100 square yards of pavement or
fraction thereof; one cylinder to be tested at the age of seven days, the other
at 28 days. Materials failing to meet specifications will be rejected and shall
be removed from the project by the permittee.
(2000 Code, § 153.08) (Ord. O-23-81, passed 10-26-1981)
§ 153.09 RESTORATION OF UNIMPROVED SURFACES; HEAVILY TRAVELED ROADWAY: CLASS 5.
    After the backfilling has been completed to a point 12 inches below
finished grade, the remainder of the opening shall be completely filled in two
six-inch courses with broken concrete, broken stone, broken hard vitrified
brick or tile, or other approved material. Each course shall be thoroughly
compacted by rolling or by tamping if rolling is not practicable. At least 60%
of broken or fractured materials used for such paving shall be from two inches
to four inches in size. Material exceeding four inches shall be rejected. The
surface shall be neatly finished with clean screenings and shall conform to the
grade of the roadway adjacent to the opening.
(2000 Code, § 153.09) (Ord. O-23-81, passed 10-26-1981)
§ 153.10 RESTORATION OF MACADAM STREETS: CLASS 4.
   (A)   Restoration of openings in first class macadam roadways, whether
water-bound, oiled, or bituminous, and whether composed of gravel or broken
stone, shall be made as provided in the City of Cincinnati Drawing No. 729,
Standard Restoration Bituminous Concrete on Stone Base, which drawing is made a
part of these rules and regulations and attached hereto.
   (B)   In the case of rough macadam or gravel streets or roads, which have
never been treated with oil or tar, restoration shall be made as specified in §
153.09.
   (C)   Where any part of the opening is within two feet of the paved portion
of a first class macadam roadway having earth berms, restoration shall be made
as provided in division (A) above.
   (D)   Where any part of the opening is within two feet of a paved portion of
a Class 1, 2, or 3 roadway having an earth berm without curb and gutter, the
restoration shall be according to divisions (A) or (B) above whichever the
Village Engineer considers necessary.
   (E)   Where the opening is within two feet of plain macadam roadway (Class
5), the restoration shall be made as specified in §
153.09.
(2000 Code, § 153.10) (Ord. O-23-81, passed 10-26-1981)
§ 153.11 CONCRETE BASE FOR ASPHALT STREETS: CLASSES 2, 3, AND 7.
   (A)   When an opening is to be restored in an asphalt surfaced street that
has a concrete base, the first operation in restoring the pavement over the
trench shall consist of installing a concrete base not less than nine inches in
thickness of Class 2, l:7 concrete. A nine-inch depth will be required
irrespective of the kind and depth of pavement base in the street at the time
the opening was made. After the backfilling has been completed, the material
under the edges of the old base shall be dug out to a depth and width of four
inches. The material then excavated may be used to round up the backfill in the
center, so that the bottom of the new base will be arched in form. The concrete
shall be thoroughly tamped under the edges of the old base and shall be brought
up to the same level as the top surface of the old base. If it is necessary to
further build up the grade of the base, the contractor shall place a separating
layer of tar paper, asphalt emulsion, or other suitable material at the level
of the top of the old base. Then more concrete may be poured to bring the base
up to the desired level. For asphalt paving, the final grade of the base shall
be not less than two and one-half inches below the street surface grade. The
surface of concrete base which is to receive binder shall be marked or grooved
so as to key and prevent displacement of the binder.
   (B)   The concrete shall stand at least 24 hours before the pavement is
laid. The permittee shall keep the pavement blocked against traffic until the
base has attained the age of at least three days or for a longer period if so
ordered by the Village Engineer.
   (C)   If, in the opinion of the Mayor, it is advisable to block the street
area against traffic for the time required for the setting of ordinary
concrete, the permittee shall be required to use an approved brand of quick-
setting cement, or a lower water cement ratio, or approved accelerator. Similar
steps may be required by the Village Engineer if the base is poured when the
temperature is below 40°F.
(2000 Code, § 153.11) (Ord. O-23-81, passed 10-26-1981)
§ 153.12 SHEET ASPHALT: CLASS 3.
   (A)   In the replacement of the various types of asphaltic street pavements,
the restoration shall be made with an asphalt mixture which shall correspond to
one of the mixtures specified in the specifications of §
153.08. Rolling will be required for all longitudinal openings. The total depth
of the bituminous wearing surface shall normally be two and one-half inches.
    (B)   Streets which have been resurfaced with asphaltic or bituminous
concrete, using a machine paver shall be considered equal to sheet asphalt
pavement irrespective of the kind of base previously existing. The restoration
shall consist of a concrete base and sheet asphalt surface and shall be similar
in all respects to sheet asphalt restoration.
   (C)   In accordance with the specifications, §
153.11, the top of the concrete base is placed uniformly two and one-half
inches below the grade of the street surface. It is roughened or marked so that
it will retain the bituminous binder. The binder is placed loose on this
concrete base and raked so that it is uniformly at, or below the finished grade
of the street. The binder should then be rolled so that it is ready to receive
traffic. Where the cut is too small to receive a roller, it can be rolled with
a loaded dual-wheeled truck provided the driver of the truck is careful to roll
in straight lines parallel with the side of the trench. Smaller cuts may be
tamped. After compaction by traffic, the binder should be the same depth over
the entire area, below the street grade between one-half inch and three-fourths
inch.
(2000 Code, § 153.12) (Ord. O-23-81, passed 10-26-1981)
§ 153.13 CONCRETE PAVEMENT: CLASS 1.
   (A)   Extreme care shall be taken in opening concrete pavements to prevent
damage to the adjoining pavement. Unless specific approval is obtained from the
Village Engineer, pavement shall be opened with the use of paving breakers or
by pneumatic drilling outlining the cut, followed by the use of paving
breakers.
   (B)   Opening in concrete pavement shall be restored in compliance with City
of Cincinnati Standard Drawing No. 734 attached hereto and the following
specifications in division (C) below.
   (C)   The thickness of the new concrete pavement shall be two inches greater
than the original pavement where the opening was made, but in any case the
thickness shall be not less than eight inches. The edge of the pavement under
the old concrete pavement shall be undermined in a manner similar to that
prescribed for concrete base in §
153.11. The opening shall be squared by straight lines, enclosing the opening
placed not less than two inches at any point from the original edges. This
squaring shall be done by sawing, use of pneumatic chisels, or manually.
Squaring shall not be vertical, but the edges shall be flared in toward the
center of the opening, while the bottom of the existing concrete pavement shall
be slightly undercut to aid in keying the restored pavement. The old
reinforcement shall be straightened out into the new pavement and the
deficiency supplied by a strip of new 42 pound 1004 mesh lapping back on the
old reinforcement. The concrete shall be l:5 mix air entrained concrete as
specified in the construction and material specifications of §
153.08.
   (D)   Prior to the placing of any concrete, the sides of the existing
pavement shall be thoroughly washed with clean water. The subgrade shall be
dampened. Longitudinal openings exceeding 20 feet in length shall be restored
with concrete having a slump of three inches or less.
   (E)   This concrete shall be vibrated with an internal type vibrator giving
particular attention to the pavement edges. Restoration of and small
longitudinal openings in concrete pavements shall be made with concrete having
a maximum slump of one inch. This concrete shall be thoroughly tamped in place.
The finish shall match the surrounding pavement. Curing shall be done in
accordance with the construction and material specifications of §
153.08.
   (F)   The area shall be blocked against traffic for the period of time the
Village Engineer deems necessary to prevent damage to the restored pavement.
Sufficient warning lights will be displayed to prevent accidents to pedestrians
or traffic. If, in the opinion of the Mayor, it is inadvisable to block the
street area against traffic for the time required for the setting of ordinary
concrete, the permittee shall be required to use an approved brand of quick
setting cement, or a lower water cement ratio, or an approved accelerator.
Similar steps may be required by the Village Engineer if the base is poured
when the temperature is below 40°F.
(2000 Code, § 153.13) (Ord. O-23-81, passed 10-26-1981)
§ 153.14 CEMENT WALKS.
   (A)   In the restoration of cement walks, in addition to the question of
serviceability and durability of restoration, the matter of appearance will be
considered in determining the area to be restored, regardless of the size of
the opening. The restoration of complete blocks will be required.
   (B)   When restoring, cement walks shall be neatly squared, cut by a series
of straight lines at least four inches back from the lines of the opening. The
cement work shall conform to the specifications for concrete walks of the
village. The new work shall be joined up with the old cement work in a neat and
professional manner. Cement walks will be one course except when two course is
necessary to match adjoining area. Expansion joints shall be restored where
required regardless of whether they existed in the original pavement.
(2000 Code, § 153.14) (Ord. O-23-81, passed 10-26-1981)
§ 153.15 BRICK WALK.
   (A)   Longitudinal openings in brick walks shall be restored as cement walk
unless otherwise ordered by the Mayor. The restoration shall be as cement walk
full width of walk, regardless of the actual width of the opening.
   (B)   (1)   Where the small opening is made and it is necessary to restore
in kind the restoration shall be made as follows: a foundation of not less than
five inches of thoroughly tamped cinders or gravel shall be provided.
      (2)   The brick shall be laid on, and the joints filled with fine dry
sand.
      (3)   All defective bricks shall be replaced by new or used whole brick
of quality equal to those in the adjacent walk.
(2000 Code, § 153.15) (Ord. O-23-81, passed 10-26-1981)
§ 153.16 SOD AREAS.
   (A)   When an opening has been made in sodded areas, not only the actual
area disturbed shall be restored, but any adjacent sod area which may have been
damaged or destroyed in connection with the permittee’s work, shall also be
renewed. If the existing sod can be removed without damage, it may be relaid,
but all damaged sod shall be replaced with new sod.
   (B)   Restoration of sod by the permittee will not be considered complete
until all restored sod has knitted with the subgrade, and all maintenance
necessary (such as watering) shall be the responsibility of the permittee and
shall be considered a part of the restoration.
(2000 Code, § 153.16) (Ord. O-23-81, passed 10-26-1981)
§ 153.17 CONCRETE BASE ONLY: CLASS 8.
   Restoration of concrete base applies where the permittee desires to make an
opening in a public way under improvement by village contract, and where the
old concrete base is to be retained as a part of the improvement.
(2000 Code, § 153.17) (Ord. O-23-81, passed 10-26-1981)
§ 153.18 RESPONSIBILITY FOR SETTLEMENT IN RESTORED AREAS.
   (A)   The permittee, in accepting and acting under a street opening permit,
thereby agrees to assume full responsibility for injury and damage to persons
and property incurred because of any settlement of a restored area, and further
agrees to pay all costs involved in reconditioning such areas.
   (B)   (1)   If any settlement in a restored area occurs within a period of
one year from date of completion of the permanent restoration, it shall be
considered as conclusive evidence of defective backfilling.
      (2)   Any expense incurred by the village in connecting such settlement
shall be paid by the permittee.
(2000 Code, § 153.18) (Ord. O-23-81, passed 10-26-1981)
§ 153.19 CLASSIFICATION OF PAVEMENTS.
   For the purpose of fixing restoration charges, pavements are classified as
follows:
   (A)   Class 1: Concrete;
   (B)   Class 2: Not used;
   (C)   Class 3: Asphalt, other bituminous pavements on concrete base, or
machine paved bituminous paving irrespective of kind of base;
   (D)   Class 4: Bituminous concrete pavements on stone base;
   (E)   Class 5: Low type pavements (plain macadam and gravel, not surface
treated or oiled);
   (F)   Class 6: Sidewalks, cement, brick, or flagstone;
   (G)   Class 7: Concrete base only or any similar material used as a base
incident to the resurfacing of a street under contract or by village forces;
   (H)   Class 8: Street under complete construction or reconstruction (not
merely resurfacing), or any entirely unimproved area except as provided in §
153.10(C);
   (I)   Class 9: Sodded areas; and
   (J)   Class 10: Tunnels.
(2000 Code, § 153.19) (Ord. O-23-81, passed 10-26-1981)
§ 153.20 SCHEDULE OF CHARGES.
   (A)   Complete restoration. Fees shall be in accordance with current
schedule on file at the Col. Donald L. Shanks Municipal Building.
   (B)   Inspection charges. Rates of charges shall be in accordance with
current schedule on file at the Col. Donald L. Shanks Municipal Building.
   (C)   Cancellation charge. If a permit is unused by the permittee within the
time specified therein or if incorrect information is contained in the
application which requires the issuance of a new permit, the unused or
incorrect permit shall be cancelled and a charge of $4 made for the issuance
and cancellation of each permit.
   (D)   Additional charges. The prices given in the schedule are basic prices
to be charged for a standard opening, which has been excavated and backfilled
in accordance with these rules and regulations. If paving blocks or paving
bricks have been damaged to such an extent that 20% or more must be discarded,
the permittee shall pay for all blocks in excess of 20% at current market
prices delivered to the work.
   (E)   New street. If, by special action of the Mayor, a permit is issued to
open any pavement less than three years old, an additional charge will be made
for such opening. This additional charge shall be on a sliding scale and shall
be 2% of the regular charge for each unelapsed month or fraction thereof of the
three year restricted period. For example, if the pavement is 27 months old
when the opening is made, the additional charge will be 18% over the regular
charge. If the pavement is nine months old when the opening is made, the
additional charge will be 54% over the regular charge.

Appendix B
§ 153.21 FORCE ACCOUNT OR COST PLUS.
   In the restoration of relatively large areas, the Mayor may order the work
charged for on a force account basis, as follows: the sum of field labor,
supervision equal to 10% of total field labor, material used, charge for use of
equipment at schedule rental rates, inspection, and issuance of permit charge
as provided, accounting charge of 2% of the total of preceding items, and 2% of
the total of all preceding items.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATIONS.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Council of
the Village of Mariemont, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows.
(Ord. O-26-10, passed 11-8-2010; Ord. O-9-23, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 154.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Village of Mariemont has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. O-26-10, passed 11-8-2010; Ord. O-9-23, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 154.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. O-26-10, passed 11-8-2010; Ord. O-9-23, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 154.004 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:

responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   FILL. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RISK ZONES. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
in any given year; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood in any given year; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood

to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (6)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas dete1mined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real  estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION or FPE. The base flood elevation plus two feet of
freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative
source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or
base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain
administrator.
   FLOODWAY.
      (1)   A FLOODWAY is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A FLOODWAY is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The FLOODWAY is an extremely hazardous area and is usually
characterized by any of the following: moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office;
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the Village of Mariemont's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A comment by FEMA
regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the
hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in
the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood
elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does not amend or revise
effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, or flood
insurance studies.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR).
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The LOWEST FLOOR of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The te1m
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in R.C. Ch. 4781.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK. As specified in the O.A.C. 4781-12-01(K), a
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK means any tract of land upon which three or more
manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or
for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle,
or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A
tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or
rented but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured
homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more
manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the
local government authority. MANUFACTURED HOME PARK does not include any tract
of land used solely for the storage or display for sale of manufactured homes.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are
referenced.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The NFIP is a federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced
on or after the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by the
Village of Mariemont and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures. For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of
an initial FIRM (May 17, 2004), and includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures.
   PERSON. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the R.C. § 111.15(A)
(2) as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT. A person registered to engage in the
practice of architecture pursuant to R.C. §§ 4703.01 and 4703.19.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER. A person registered as a professional
engineer pursuant to R.C. Ch. 4733.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR. A person registered as a professional
surveyor pursuant to R.C. Ch. 4733.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Also known as AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD, it
is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood
insurance studies, flood boundary and floodway maps and flood hazard boundary
maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, or A99. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS may also
refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal state or
local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone
soils associated with a watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or  the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to the before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanita1y, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.

§ 154.035 MAP MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.
   To meet the National Flood Insurance Program minimum requirements to have
flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to ensure that the Village of
Mariemont's flood maps, studies, and other data identified in §
154.006 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
   (A)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
      (1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         (a)   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         (b)   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
         (c)   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
         (d)   Subdivision or other new development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with §
154.052.
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with §

§ 154.036 DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (A)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (B)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in §§
154.070 through
154.075.
   (D)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.

§ 154.037 USE OF PRELIMINARY FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP AND/OR FLOOD INSURANCE
STUDY DATA.
   (A)   Zone A.
      (1)   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from the
preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be reasonably utilized as best available
data.
      (2)   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final flood
elevation determination has been provided in a letter of final determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
   (B)   Zones AE, A1-30, AH, and AO.
      (1)   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However:
         (a)   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
         (b)   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not be
used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or until
all appeals have been resolved.
      (2)   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of §
154.059(B) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the best
data available.
   (C)   Zones B, C, and X. Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary
FIRM or FIS are not required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the
effective FIRM which are being revised to Zone AE, A1-30, AH, or AO.
Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data
to ensure that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are
protected.

flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
   (B)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (A)   Development in floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         (a)   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in §
154.035(A);
         (b)   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         (c)   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         (d)   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         (e)   Concurrence of the Mayor of the Village of Mariemont and the
Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
   (B)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         (a)   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         (b)   Section
154.059(A)(2)(a) and (A)(2)(c) through (A)(2)(e).
   (C)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bank full
stage." The field determination of "bank full stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a federal, state, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bank full flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bank full flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village of Mariemont specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in §
154.035(A)(1)(c) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

§ 154.073 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (A)   Application for a variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the Village of
Mariemont.
   (B)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold a

   (C)   Public hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         (d)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         (e)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (2)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (E)   Other conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in division (C)(1) to (C)(11) have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. O-26-10, passed 11-8-2010; Ord. O-9-23, passed 4-10-2023)
§ 154.074 PROCEDURE AT HEARING.

   (B)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented

   (C)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony in
support of the appeal or variance.
   (D)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition to
the appeal or variance.
   (E)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
   (F)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become part
of the record for appeal.
   (G)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
   (H)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its decision.
The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and thereafter
issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a reasonable
time after the hearing.
