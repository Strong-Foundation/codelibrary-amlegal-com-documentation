   WHEREAS, the Council of the Village of Lowellville, Ohio, has had the matter
of codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
 
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
 
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council.
 
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Council of the Village of
Lowellville, State of Ohio:
 
   Section 1. That the ordinances of the Village of Lowellville, Ohio, of a
general and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated
into component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved,
adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Lowellville, Ohio, 1993.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk-Treasurer, attached to this Ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the Village.
 
   Section 2. That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 4 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to May 12, 1993, which are inconsistent with any provision of the
Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege.
      (2)   The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property.
      (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment.
      (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation.
      (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other

      (9)   The annexation or detachment of territory.
      (10)   Any legislation enacted subsequent to May 12, 1993.
   Section 3. That pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.21 and 731.23 the Clerk-Treasurer
shall cause to be published in a manner required by law this Adopting Ordinance
together with a summary of the new matter contained in the codification adopted
hereby.
   Section 4. That this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety
and welfare of the residents of the Village, the reason for the necessity being
that there exists an imperative need for the earliest publication and
distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of the
Village, so as to facilitate administration, daily operation and avoid
practical and legal entanglements, wherefore this ordinance shall be in full
force and effect from and immediately after its passage.

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
 
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
 
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

(ORC 1.58)
101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under

taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.

number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

any member thereof, is hereby authorized to make such investigations as it
deems necessary and proper, to examine any persons, under oath or otherwise, to
inspect all books, records or memoranda pertinent to the investigation, and for
this purpose to require by subpoena, to be served in the same manner that a
summons is served in a civil action in a Court of Common Pleas, the production
books, paper and records and the attendance of all persons, whether parties or

   (b)   Whenever it is charged, or the Committee has reason to believe that

issue and cause to be served upon such person, hereinafter referred to as the
respondent, a complaint stating the charges in respect and containing a notice
of hearing before the Committee or a member thereof at a place therein fixed
not less than ten days after the service of such complaint. The respondent
shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear at such

respondent has engaged or is engaging in any unfair employment practice, the
Committee shall state its findings of fact supporting the same and shall
certify the case and the entire record of its proceedings to the Village
Solicitor for legal action. If the Committee, prior to the commencement of
proceedings under Section
153.99 , as a result of its efforts of adjustment or otherwise, finds that the
respondent has ceased such unfair employment practice, no certification of such
proceedings shall be made to the Village Solicitor unless the Committee finds
such respondent again engaging in an unfair employment practice, in which case
both findings shall be certified to the Village Solicitor.
   (c)   Whenever the Committee finds any official, agent or employee of the
Village has engaged in any unfair employment practice, it shall recommend
appropriate action to the Mayor.
   (d)   Whenever the Committee finds any person operating an enterprise which
solicits or accepts the custom of the public generally and which is operated
under a privilege hereafter granted by the Village, has engaged or is engaging
in any unfair employment practice with respect to employment within such
enterprise, it shall report the same to the agency of the Village which granted
such privilege, which agency may suspend such privilege for not more than ten
days. When the Committee finds that such a person has committed further unfair
employment practices subsequent to such finding, it shall report the same to
such agency and a second violation shall constitute a grounds for which such
agency may, in its discretion, suspend or revoke such privilege for not to
exceed one year.
   (e)   Every contract hereinafter awarded by this Village or any of its
contracting agencies, shall contain a provision obligating the contractor not
to engage in any conduct defined as unfair employment practice in Section
153.03 , and requiring such contractor to include a similar provision in all of
his subcontracts. Breach of this convenant may be regarded as a material breach
of the contract.
(Ord. 563. Passed 3-14-51.)
153.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever commits any unfair employment practice as herein defined shall be
fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00).

imprisonment for not more than thirty days.

to eligible employees for up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave per year under
circumstances that are critical to the life of the employee's family. Leaves
may be taken:
      (1)   Upon the birth of the employee's child.
      (2)   Upon the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or
foster care;
      (3)    When the employee is needed to care for a child, spouse or parent
who has a serious health condition; and
      (4)    When the employee is unable to perform the functions of his or her
position because of a serious health condition.
   (b)    Eligibility.
      (1)    Must have been employed for at least twelve months in total: and
      (2)    Must have worked at least 1250 hours during the twelve (12) month
period preceding the commencement of the leave.
   The twelve-month period for which employees may be eligible for family and
medical leave will be calculated on a calendar year basis.
   (c)    Certification. Medical certification is required to support a claim
for leave for an employee's own serious health condition or to care for a
seriously ill child, spouse or parent. For the employee's own medical leave,
the certification must include a statement that the employee is unable to
perform the functions of his or her position. For leave to care for a seriously
ill child, spouse or parent, the certification must include an estimate of the
amount of time the employee is needed to provide care. The Village, in its
discretion, may require a second medical opinion and periodic recertification's
at its own expense.
   If medically necessary for a serious health condition of the employee or his
or her spouse, child or parent, leave may be taken on an intermittent or
reduced leave schedule. If leave is requested on this basis, however, the
Village may require the employee to transfer temporarily to an alternative
position which better accommodates recurring periods of absence or a part-time
schedule, provided that the position has equivalent pay and benefits.
   (d)    Spouse Employees. Spouses who are both employed by the Village are
entitled to a total of twelve weeks of leave (rather than twelve weeks each)
for the birth or adoption of a child or for the care of a sick parent.
   (e)    Notice. When the need for leave is foreseeable, such as the birth or
adoption of a
child or planned medical treatment, the employee must provide reasonable prior
notice and make efforts to schedule such leave so as not to disrupt Village
operations. In case of illnesses, the employee will be required to report
periodically on his or her leave status and intention to return to work.
   (f)    Benefit Continuation. Any employee who is granted an approved leave
of absence under this policy is advised to provide for the retention of his or
her group insurance coverage by arranging to pay the premium contributions
during the period of unpaid absence.
   If an employee elects not to return to work after completion of an approved
unpaid leave of absence, the Village may recover from the employee the cost of
any payments made to maintain the employee's insurance coverage unless the
failure to return was for reasons beyond the employee's control.
   
   (g)    Leave of Absence Form. A family and medical leave of absence form
must be
completed in detail, signed by the employee, submitted to his or her immediate
supervisor for proper approvals and forwarded to the Clerk's Office. If
possible, the form should be submitted thirty days in advance of the effective
date of the leave.
   (h)    Request for Leave. All requests for family and medical leaves of
absence due to illness will include the following information attached to a
completed request form:
      (1)    Sufficient medical certification stating
         A.    The date on which the serious health condition commenced;
         B.    The probable duration of the condition;
         C.    The appropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health
care provider regarding the condition.
      (2)    For purposes of leave to care for a child, spouse or parent, the
certificate should give an estimate of the amount of time that the employee is
needed to provide such care.
      (3)    For purposes of leave for an employee's illness, the certificate
must state that the employee is unable to perform the functions of his or her
position.
      (4)    In the case of certification for intermittent leave or leave on a
reduced leave schedule for planned medical treatment, the dates on which such
treatment is expected to be given and the duration of such treatment must be
stated.
   
   (i)    Use of Paid Benefits. Employees are required to use any paid leave,
including paid vacation, paid sick leave and paid holidays concurrent with
unpaid family and medical leave. Paid sick leave must be used concurrently with
unpaid family and medical leave if the employee is unable to work due to his or
her own serious health condition or to care for a family member with a serious
health condition, as provided for in the Family and Medical Leave Act.
   (j)   Workers' Compensation. When a work-related illness or injury also
causes a serious
health condition and the employee elects to take Workers' Compensation
benefits, other paid leave, such as vacation, sick time and holidays, will not
be substituted, but the absence will count against the employee's family and
medical leave entitlement.

the decision of the Board within five days after the decision. If the Board

before the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (c)   Village Landmarks and Village Preservation Districts. The Board may
designate such Village landmarks and Village Preservation Districts as it deems
proper. Council shall formally approve all designations according to law.
      (1)   “Village landmark” means a building, structure or feature that is
the site of a significant historical event or identified with a person who
contributed significantly to Lowellville’s history, or that is unique for its
location as a familiar and established visual feature of Lowellville, or that
embodies particular architectural style or unusual details, or that is the work
of a particular builder or architect. Such buildings shall generally be over
fifty years of age, but shall not be required to be of such age.
      (2)   “Village Preservation District” means an area that, through its
visual character, has definable educational, social, historical or
architectural significance to Lowellville and the region.
      (3)   Landmark and District designations recognize the particular
importance of buildings, structures, sites and areas, pointing out their
educational and cultural value to the community. Designation promotes awareness
of the local heritage. All landmarks and Districts shall have property lines as
their boundaries.
      (4)   For each proposed District or landmark, all relevant information
shall be gathered into a public record which shall be made available upon
request. The record may be amended as further research is completed or by the
Design Review Board after a public hearing. The subsequent public hearing shall
elaborate the boundaries, character and importance of the proposed designation.

landmark and District. The Chairman of the Design Review Board shall preside at
all hearings.

before the Building and Zoning Inspector issues a permit for the demolition of
all or a part of a structure, the Building and Zoning Inspector shall transmit
the application for demolition to the Board for their consideration. The Board
shall require a statement of the reasons why the building or part of the
building is being considered for demolition. In the case of demolition in a
District, if the Board finds that demolition would severely damage the
character of the District, and thereby alter the reason for the designation of
the District, then the Board may stop demolition for a period of ninety days.
In the case of a landmark, if the Board finds that demolition would severely
alter the exterior architectural importance or otherwise affect the reasons
upon which the landmark was designated, the Board may stop demolition for a
period of ninety days. In the ninety-day period, the property owner and the
Board shall explore all means of protecting the structures from demolition,
whether by adaptive use, remodeling or other means. If, at the end of ninety

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
161. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 161
Mayor's Court
161.01   Diversion program.
 
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
      In Ward v. Village of Monroville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules"
which prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic
cases. Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under
which the Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in
Ward v. Village of Monroville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman
v. Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant
is entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic    violation bureau
and specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule
of fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

161.01 DIVERSION PROGRAM.
   (a)   The prosecuting attorney in Mayors Court may establish pre-trial
diversion programs for adults who are accused of committing offenses under the
ordinances of the Village of Lowellville Ohio dealing with income tax; sewer;
planning and zoning and unlicensed drivers. The prosecuting attorney may
require, as a condition of an accused’s participation in the program, the
accused to pay a reasonable fee for supervision services that include, but are
not limited to, monitoring and drug testing. The programs shall be operated
pursuant to written standards approved by journal entry by the Mayor presiding
in the Mayors Court.
   (b)   An accused who enters a diversion program shall do all of the
following:
      (1)   Waive, in writing the accused’s right to a speedy trial, and enter
a plea of guilty to the charge(s) sentencing on the same being held in abeyance
until such time as contemplated in subsection (c) below;
      (2)   Agree, in writing, to the tolling while in the program of all
periods of limitation established by statues or rules of court, that are
applicable to the offense with which the accused is charged and to the
conditions of the diversion program established by the prosecuting attorney;
      (3)   Agree, in writing, to pay any reasonable fee for supervision
services established by the prosecuting attorney and all court costs.
   (c)   If the accused satisfactorily completes the diversion program, the
prosecuting attorney shall recommend to the trial court that the charges
against the accused be dismissed, and the court, upon the recommendation of the
prosecuting attorney, shall dismiss the charges at the accused costs. If the
accused violates the conditions of the agreement pursuant to which the accused
has been released, the court may sentence the accused immediately upon the
charges in the manner provided by law. (Ord. 3305. Passed 8-9-06.)

No penalty or interest shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is

   (e)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax

liability affecting the taxpayer's Village tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to the Village
tax based upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and pay any
additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.

   (a)   In accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner each employee within or doing business with the Village shall

Chapter that is not otherwise defined in this Chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax

taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:

loss carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following
the taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years

compute adjusted federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer
were a C corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid
or accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless
such payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as

employed retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer,
amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts
paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed

         (a)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession

original cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used

municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
172.12 (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer

located in the Village of Lowellville, Ohio, to the commissions received from
the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the Village of Lowellville,

file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or

payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other

responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold Village of
Lowellville, Ohio, income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's
employees and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the

another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception

directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax

consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of

increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Village of
Lowellville, Ohio, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability
for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of
the taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
172.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section

the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date

      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Village of Lowellville, Ohio, under Section
172.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village of
Lowellville, Ohio, but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of
the calendar year that includes the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 3849. Passed 10-14-15.)
172.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 3849. Passed 10-14-15.)
172.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
172.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the Village of Lowellville:
      (1)    Overpayments ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars or
more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
172.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
172.18 (A)(4). (Ord. 3849. Passed 10-14-15.)
172.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the Village of Lowellville,
Ohio, but should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by
the Village of Lowellville, Ohio, as a refund but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village of Lowellville, Ohio, is subject to
recovery by the Village of Lowellville, Ohio. If the Village of Lowellville,
Ohio's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a refund
of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the Village of
Lowellville, Ohio, shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or
withholding the Village of Lowellville, Ohio, claims is due with respect to
such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first
municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)    If the Village of Lowellville, Ohio's tax rate is less than the tax
rate in the other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be
calculated using the Village of Lowellville, Ohio's tax rate. However, if the
Village of Lowellville, Ohio's tax rate is greater than the tax rate in the
other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is to be
paid to the Village of Lowellville, Ohio, along with any penalty and interest
that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carry forward.
(Ord. 3849. Passed 10-14-15.)
172.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the Village of Lowellville, Ohio, changes as a result of an adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the Village of Lowellville, Ohio. The amended return shall
be filed on a form required by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
172.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
Section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the Village of Lowellville, Ohio. A request filed under this
division shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's
annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is
also filed within the time prescribed in Section
172.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village of Lowellville, Ohio's tax
liability, that taxpayer shall make and file an amended Village of Lowellville,
Ohio, return showing income subject to the Village of Lowellville, Ohio, income
tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax liability. The
taxpayer shall pay any additional Village of Lowellville, Ohio, income tax
shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax
or overpayment is less than ten dollars.
(Ord. 3849. Passed 10-14-15.)
172.12 LIMITATIONS.

agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
172.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after

required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C) A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
172.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village of Lowellville, Ohio,
does not prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
172.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
172.09.
   
   (E)    No civil action to recover Village of Lowellville, Ohio, income tax
or related penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the
following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 3849. Passed 10-14-15.)
172.13 AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. (Ord. 3849.
Passed 10-14-15.)
172.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Village of Lowellville,
Ohio, official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person
to whom the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
   "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the
mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village of
Lowellville, Ohio, official, or the designee of either, with the person.
Nothing in this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from
entering into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually file
such an appeal with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 3849. Passed 10-14-15.)
172.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village of Lowellville, Ohio, that arises pursuant to the Village of
Lowellville's income tax imposed in accordance with this Chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the Village
of Lowellville, Ohio:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 3849. Passed 10-14-15.)
172.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village of
Lowellville, Ohio, as authorized by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator or a
designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this Chapter and other related tax information to the internal revenue
service, the tax commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Village of Lowellville, Ohio, from
publishing or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose
information with respect to particular taxpayers. (Ord. 3849. Passed 10-14-15.)
172.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Village of Lowellville, Ohio,
ordinance or state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly
procure, counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report,
return, schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or
amend, or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or
amendment of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement,

to provide identifying information who has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally

shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (4)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.

   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of

303.991 COMMITTING AN OFFENSE WHILE DISTRACTED PENALTY.
   (a)   As used in this section and each section of the Traffic Code where
specified, all of the following apply:
      (1)   “Distracted” means doing either of the following while operating a
vehicle:
         A.   Using an electronic wireless communications device, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, in violation of that section.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
331.43.
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a
utility.
   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.

flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by

over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those

admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any

under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains

violation under subsections (d)(1)A., (d)(1)B., or (d)(1)C. of this section, as
applicable.
      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom subsection
(d)(1)A of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00) under subsection (d)(1)A. of this section and the
assessment of points under subsection (d)(4) of this section, the offender
instead may elect to attend the distracted driving safety course, as described
in Section
303.991. If the offender attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall not be required to pay the fine and
shall not have the points assessed against that offender’s driver’s license if
the offender submits the written evidence to the court. This subsection does
not apply with respect to any offender in the category of offenders to whom
subsection (d)(1)B., C., or D. of this section applies.
      (3)   The court may impose any other penalty authorized under Ohio R.C.
2929.21 to 2929.28. However, the court shall not impose a fine or a suspension
not otherwise specified in subsection (d)(1) of this section. The court also
shall not impose a jail term or community residential sanction.

shall be assessed for a violation of subsection (a) of this section in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and Ohio R.C. 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense
as a strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based
on the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for the purposes of enforcing this
section unless the officer visually observes the operator using, holding, or
physically supporting with any part of the person’s body the electronic
wireless communications device.
      (2)   A law enforcement officer who stops the operator of a motor vehicle
for a violation of subsection (a) of this section shall inform the operator
that the operator may decline a search of the operator’s electronic wireless
communications device. The officer shall not do any of the following:

voluntarily and unequivocally gives consent for the officer to access the
device;
         B.   Confiscate the device while awaiting the issuance of a warrant to
access the device;
         C.   Obtain consent from the operator to access the device through
coercion or any other improper means. Any consent by the operator to access the
device shall be voluntary and unequivocal before the officer may access the
device without a warrant.

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

registrar shall destroy any such license, temporary instruction permit, or
identification card that is not returned to the issuing authority.
      (3)   No person shall possess more than one valid license, temporary

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two
offenses are allied offenses of similar import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.

that order.
   (b)   Without limiting or precluding the consideration of any other evidence
in determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5)

plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C.
4503.233.
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded

the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded

issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as

proceeds from any fine imposed under this subsection shall be distributed in
accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

available in the law enforcement automated data system. A person included in
the database under subsection (c)(5) of this section is not required to have
the affidavit obtained in accordance with subsection (c)(3) of this section in
their possession while operating or occupying an automobile.
      (6)   A physician or chiropractor who issues an affidavit for the
purposes of subsection (c)(3) or (4) of this section is immune from civil
liability arising from any injury or death sustained by the person who was
issued the affidavit due to the failure of the person to wear an occupant
restraining device unless the physician or chiropractor, in issuing the
affidavit, acted in a manner that constituted willful, wanton or reckless
misconduct.
      (7)   The Registrar shall adopt rules in accordance with Ohio R.C.
Chapter 119, establishing a process for a person to be included in the database
under subsection (c)(5) of this section. The information provided and included
in the database under subsection (c)(5) of this section is not a public record
subject to inspection or copying under Ohio R.C. 149.43.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on
any street or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (b) hereof has been or is being
committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for
a violation of that nature or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution
of a person for a violation of that nature, and no law enforcement officer
shall view the interior or visually inspect any automobile being operated on
any street or highway for the sole purpose of determining whether a violation
of that nature has been or is being committed.

forwarded to the Treasurer of State for deposit as provided in Ohio R.C.
4513.263.
   (f)   (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(2) of this section, the failure of a
person to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of subsection (b)(1) or (3) or the failure of a
person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an automobile being
operated by that person is wearing all of the available elements of a properly
adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2) of this
section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   (1)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be
fined thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
      (3)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates
subsection (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
subsection (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates subsection (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) hereof, sections of the
Codified Ordinances defining offenses or penalties shall be strictly construed
against the Municipality and liberally construed in favor of the accused.
   (b)   Rules of criminal procedure and sections of the Ohio Revised Code
providing for criminal procedure shall be construed so as to effect the fair,
impartial, speedy and sure administration of justice.
   (c)   Any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances that refers to a
previous conviction of or plea of guilty to a violation of a section of the
Codified Ordinances or Ohio Revised Code or of a division of a section of the
Codified Ordinances or Ohio Revised Code shall be construed to also refer to a
previous conviction of or plea of guilty to a substantially equivalent offense
under an existing or former law of this State, another state, or the United
States or under an existing or former municipal ordinance.
   (d)   Any provision of the Codified Ordinances that refers to a section, or
to a division of a section, of the Codified Ordinances that defines or

501.05 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (a)    A person is subject to misdemeanor prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or

service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section 
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09 .
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense
designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization
is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such
provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense
designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization
is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such
provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of his office or employment.
   (b)   When strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated association, estate, trust or other commercial or legal entity.
"Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a governmental
agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a

R.C. 2925.51, or in any other manner on any substance that was the basis of, or
involved in, the offense to determine whether the substance contained any
amount of a controlled substance if the results of the tests indicate that the

any controlled substance.
   The court shall hold a hearing to determine the amount of costs to be
imposed under this section. The court may hold the hearing as part of the

and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person complained
against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take such

fifteen calendar days following service of the Board's order complied with the
order, the Board will recertify the matter to the Law Director for enforcement.
   (h)   Upon recertification to the Law Director, for enforcement, he shall

Housing Board of the Village of Lowellville before a court of competent
jurisdiction. In any such proceeding where the court determines that there has
been a vi
olation of this chapter, the court shall award compensatory damages and, where
appropriate, punitive damages, along with attorney fees. The court may also
order such other relief as it deems necessary or appropriate.

purpose;

activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02 .
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02 (c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section

section. (ORC 2909.11)

or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that
is not an occupied structure;
      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being

 545.05, 
545.06 or

545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
 545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud

(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under

single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.

compensate the owner for its loss.

materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under  subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and

(Ord. 2340. Passed 8-13-86.)
905.04 APPLICATIONS FOR PERMITS; FEE.
   (a)   Applications. Permits for making openings in Village streets shall be
issued only by the Village Administrator and only for some duly authorized
purpose. Applications for street opening permits shall be made on forms
provided by the Village Administrator. The application shall give the size and
location of the proposed opening and shall state the kind of paving where the
cut is to be made. The permit shall be issued only after ample security has
been given the Village to insure the proper restoration and subsequent
maintenance of the street pavement disturbed. Such security shall be furnished
in one of the following ways:
      (1)   A cash deposit may be made with each application sufficient to
cover the cost of restoration; or
      (2)   A surety bond may be filed with each application to cover the cost
of restoration. Such bond shall remain in effect for a one year period; and
      (3)   A general deposit may be made, to be replenished from time to time
and to constitute a running account against which permits may be issued
provided that no permit shall be issued when the net unencumbered balance in
the account becomes less than the estimated cost of the requisite restoration.
   In the case of Village contracts involving the cutting of street pavements,
permits may be issued without cash deposit, but in such cases sufficient money
to pay for the necessary street restoration shall be withheld from the contract
moneys owning to the contractor until such street restoration is completed by
the contractor to the satisfaction of the Village Administrator, or until such
contractor shall have paid to the Village the requisite amount for the street
restoration.
   (b)   Fee. A fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) shall be paid for the
issuing of such permit. This fee shall not apply to utility companies
conducting street openings on sidewalks and rights of way.
   (c)   Responsibilities for Applications and Fee. The contractor shall assume
the responsibility for applying for and securing a permit for making openings
in Village streets. The contractor shall assume the responsibility to pay the
required fee for issuing of such permit. As used in this section, a contractor
means the individual or legal entity who performs the street opening or
excavation work.

905.05 OPENINGS BY VILLAGE, COUNTY OR STATE.
   When any Village department or division requires the installation of
underground conduits or structures, it may obtain the necessary street opening
permits without taking any cash deposit. The department or division shall be
charged, however, for the necessary street restoration work, and the amount of
the charge shall be paid out of the appropriations for the respective
department or division. In special cases, the Village Administrator may, in his
discretion, direct the performance of the street restoration work to be done by
the Department of Public Safety and Service without charging the department or
division for whose purposes the work is done. No cash deposit shall be required
from the County or the State for street opening permits. Where, in any such
case, the work done inures greatly to the benefit of the Village, the street
restoration may, with the approval of the Village Administrator, be made at the
cost of the Village.
(Ord. 2340. Passed 8-13-86.)
905.06 OPENINGS BY PUBLIC UTILITY CORPORATIONS.
   Where a public utility corporation is authorized by a special agreement with
the Village to do its own restoration work in connection with the opening of
streets for maintenance and construction work, the required deposit shall be
sufficient to cover inspection costs. If, however, in any case the restoration
is to be made by the Village, the deposit shall be increased accordingly. Any
such public utility corporation shall be permitted to maintain with the Clerk-
Treasurer a general deposit account to be replenished from time to time,
against which permits may be issued. No permit shall be issued when the net
unencumbered balance is less than the amount necessary to cover the estimated
Village costs for inspection and restoration.
(Ord. 2340. Passed 8-13-86.)
905.07 RESTORATION OF PAVEMENT.
   Where openings have been or are to be made in a street, the Village
Administrator shall provide for the restoration of the street pavement in one
of the following ways:
   (a)   The entire work of restoration, including both paving surface and
paving base, may be performed directly by the Department of Public Safety and
Service and the permittee has completed the back fill.
   (b)   The paving surface may be installed by the Department after the
permittee has made the back fill and installed the pavement base.
   (c)   The work may be done either completely as in subsection (a) or as to
paving surface only, as in subsection (b), by a Village contractor thereunto
duly authorized by a contract with the Village.
   (d)   The entire work of restoration may be done by the permittee.
      (Ord. 2340. Passed 8-13-86.)
905.08 LIMITATIONS ON OPENINGS.
   No person, firm or corporation shall make any opening in, break, tear up,
excavate or remove the surface of any street, avenue, alley or other public
way, or any portion thereof, in the Village, in, or upon any street, avenue,
alley or other public way, which shall be built, paved, resurfaced or repaved
at any time within a period of five years after the building, paving,
resurfacing or repaving of the street or alley; and the Village Administrator
or Street Superintendent and all other officers and departments of the Village
are hereby prohibited from granting any permits for any such openings, breaks,
tearing up, excavation or removal within this period; provided that the Village
Administrator may, on account of any emergency affecting public health or
public welfare, and which could not have been forseen, suspend the operation of
this five-year rule as to any application for a permit, and in such cases, upon
granting of the application, the work may be performed within the five-year
period but the mere failure or neglect of the applicant, or other person, firm
or corporation to lay or have laid, mains, pipes, wires or connections or other
means of transportation of utilities before the five-year period, or the
inconvenience, by reason of the failure or neglect, to property along the
particular street or way described in the application shall not be considered
to be an emergency; provided further, that where water mains or water pipes
were laid along or to any lot or piece of property previous to the beginning of
the five-year period, and, by reason of unforseen development, the water mains
or service pipes have become, in the opinion of the Village Administrator, of
inadequate size, then the Village Administrator may suspend the five-year rule
for the purpose of and to the extent necessary for the laying of larger water
mains or larger service pipes in any street or other public way. The five-year
period shall be deemed to begin at the time of the completion and final
acceptance by the Village of any construction, paving, resurfacing or repaving.

(Ord. 3956. Passed 5-7-19.)
   913.09 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (a)   Consent Orders. The Village or Ohio EPA may enter into Consent Orders,
assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement
with any User responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include
specific action to be taken by the User to correct the noncompliance within a
time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force
and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections (b) and
(c) hereof and shall be judicially enforceable.
   (b)   Show Cause Hearing. The Village or Ohio EPA may order a User which has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, to appear before the Village or the Ohio
EPA and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
Notice shall be served on the User specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the User show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not
be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered
or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 5 days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any Authorized Representative of the User
as defined and required by OAC 3745-36-08. A show cause hearing shall not be a
bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
   (c)   Compliance Orders. When the Village or Ohio EPA finds that a User has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Village or Ohio EPA may issue an
order to the User responsible for the discharge directing that the User come
into compliance within a specified time. If the User does not come into
compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless
adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring
and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants
discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the User of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
   (d)   Cease and Desist Orders. When the Village or Ohio EPA finds that a
User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, or that the User's past violations are
likely to recur, the Village or Ohio EPA may issue an order to the User
directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the User to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and
desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the User.
   (e)   Administrative Fines.
      (1)   When the Village finds that a User has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Village may fine such User in an
amount not to exceed $1,000.00 per day. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-
violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average
discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of
violation.
      (2)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days
if no appeal is taken, be assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid
balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at the statutory rate per month.
A lien against the User's property may be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and
penalties by the Village.
      (3)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request
for the Village to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine
amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit,
the Village may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the User's appeal
is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall
be returned to the User. The Village may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
      (4)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
   
   (f)   Emergency Suspensions. The Village or the Ohio EPA may immediately
suspend a User's discharge, after informal notice to the User, whenever such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which
reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment
to the health or welfare of persons. The Village or the Ohio EPA may also
immediately suspend a User's discharge, after notice and opportunity to
respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which
presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
      (1)   Any User notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a User's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Village may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance
of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its
receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Village or Ohio EPA
may allow the User to recommence its discharge when the User has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of the Village or the Ohio EPA that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (g)
are initiated against the User.
      (2)   A User that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Village and Ohio EPA prior to the date of
any show cause or termination hearing under subsection (b) or (g) hereof.
   Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any Emergency Suspension under this Section.
   (g)   Termination of Discharge. 
      (1)   In addition to the provisions in Section
913.05(b), any User who violates the following conditions is subject to
discharge termination:
         A.    Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;
         B.    Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
         C.    Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
         D.    Refusal of reasonable access to the User's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
         E.    Violation of the Pretreatment Standards in Section
913.02.
      (2)   Such User will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (b)
hereof why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by
the Village or Ohio EPA shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the User.
         (Ord. 3956. Passed 5-7-19.)
   913.10 JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (a)   Injunctive Relief. When the Village finds that a User has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Village may petition the Mahoning
County Court for the issuance of a temporary injunction or permanent
injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance
of the individual wastewater discharge permit, the general permit, order, or
other requirement imposed by this ordinance on activities of the User. The
Village may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or
equitable relief, including but not limited to a requirement for the User to
conduct
environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User.
   (b)   Civil Penalties.
      (1)   A User who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit
or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement
shall be liable to the Village for a maximum civil penalty of $1,000 per
violation, per day as stated in Section
913.09(c). In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit,
penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
      (2)   The Village may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs,
and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling
and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the
Village.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the User's violation, corrective
actions by the User, the compliance history of the User, and any other factor
as justice requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User.
   (c)   Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this ordinance are
not exclusive. The Village may take any, all, or any combination of these
actions against a noncompliant User. Enforcement of pretreatment violations
will generally be in accordance with this ordinance. However, the Village may
take other action against any User when the circumstances warrant. Further, the
Village is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any
noncompliant User.
(Ord. 3956. Passed 5-7-16.)
   913.11 SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION.
   (a)   Liability Insurance. The Village may decline to issue or reissue an
individual wastewater discharge or a general permit to any User who has failed
to comply with any provision of this ordinance, a previous individual
wastewater discharge permit, or a previous general permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, unless the User
first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to
restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
   (b)   Payment of Outstanding Fees and Penalties. The Village may decline to
issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit
to any User who has failed to pay any outstanding fees, fines or penalties
incurred as a result of any provision of this ordinance, a previous individual
wastewater discharge permit, or a previous general permit or order issued
hereunder.
   (c)   Water Supply Severance. Whenever a User has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, a general permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment
Standard or Requirement, water service to the User may be severed. Service will
recommence, at the User's expense, only after the User has satisfactorily
demonstrated its ability to comply.
(Ord. 3956. Passed 5-7-19.)
   913.12 WASTEWATER TREATMENT FEES.
   (a)   High Strength Waste Streams.
      (1)   Each person, firm, or corporation whose premises are served by a
sewer connection which discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or
other liquids (other than normal sewage) either directly or indirectly into the
sewerage system under the jurisdiction of the Village shall pay a sewerage
surcharge in addition to the Sewer User Charge for normal sewage if the limits
for total suspended solids, CBOD and oil and grease exceed the limits
established in Section
913.02(d). The charges will be calculated and adjusted monthly and are
dependent upon laboratory test results conducted at the industrial user's
expense.
      (2)   When any of the above parameters of water or wastes accepted by the
Lowellville Waste Water Treatment Plant exceeds the daily concentration limits,
the excess concentration shall be subjected to a surcharge.
      (3)   The surcharge fees for Total Suspended Solids, CBOD and Oil &
Grease are as follows:
   
         Total Suspended Solids - $ 0.25 per pound
         CBOD - $ 0.25 per pound
         Oil & Grease - $ 0.25 per pound
      (4)   Monthly surcharge costs will be determined by utilizing the
following equations:
         
         (Avg. Daily Flow) x (#of days in month)= Total Flow in MGD
         
         (Total Flow) x (8.34) x (Reported parameter in mg/1 - Daily Limit of
parameter in mg/1) = Lbs of parameter subject to surcharging.
         (Lbs of parameter subject to surcharge) x (Surcharge amount)= Total
monthly surcharge.
         (Ord. 3956. Passed 5-7-19.)
   913.13 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of this ordinance is invalidated by any court of competent
jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall not be affected and shall continue
in full force and effect.
(Ord. 3956. Passed 5-7-19.)
   913.14 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This ordinance shall be in full force and effect immediately following its
passage and approval by Lowellville City Council.

929.01 FINDINGS.
   (a)   The Village maintains a system of storm and surface water management
facilities including, but not limited to, inlets, conduits, manholes, channels,
ditches, drainage easements, retention and detention basins, infiltration
facilities, and other components as well as natural waterways.
   (b)   The stormwater system in the Village needs regular maintenance and
improvements.
   (c)   Water quality is degrading due to erosion and the discharge of
nutrients, metals, oil, grease, toxic materials, and other substances into and
through the stormwater system.
   (d)   The public health, safety, and welfare is adversely affected by poor
ambient water quality and flooding that results from inadequate management of
both the quality and quantity of stormwater.
   (e)   All real property in the Village either uses or benefits from the
maintenance of the stormwater system.
   (f)   The extent of use of the stormwater system by each property is
dependant on factors that influence runoff, including land use and the amount
of impervious surface on the property.
   (g)   The costs of improving, maintaining, operating, and monitoring the
stormwater system should be allocated, to the extent practicable, to all
property owners.
   (h)   Management of the stormwater system to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare requires adequate revenues and it is in the interest of the
public to finance stormwater management adequately with a user charge system
that is reasonable.

system is provided to protect the waterways and land in the Village by
controlling flooding and to protect the natural environment. The costs of
designing, developing, improving, operating, maintaining, and monitoring the
stormwater system required in the Village should, therefore, be allocated, to
the extent of practicable, to all property owners based on their impact on the
stormwater system. In order to provide revenue to fund those costs and to
fairly allocate those costs, a Stormwater Management Fund (“the Fund”) is
established.
   (b)   All revenues collected form the Stormwater Management Fee from grants,
permit fees and other charges collected under , Stormwater Management, shall be
deposited to the Fund. The Council may make additional appropriations to the

929.07 CLASSIFICATION OF PROPERTY FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINATION OF THE
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FEE.
   (a)   For purposes of determining the Stormwater Management Fee, all
properties in the Village are classified into one of the following classes:
      (1)   Single family residential property; or
      (2)   Other developed property.
   (b)   Single Family Residential Fee. The Council finds that the intensity of
development most parcels of real property in the Village classified as single
family residential is similar and that it would be excessively and
unnecessarily expensive to determine precisely the square footage of the
improvements (such as buildings, structure, and other impervious area) on each
such parcel. Therefore, all single family residential properties in the Village
shall be charged a flat Stormwater Management Fee, equal the base rate,
regardless of the size of the parcel or the improvements.
   (c) Other developed property for the same reasons stated in subsection (b)
hereof shall be charged a flat fee equal to four times the rate charged to
single family residential fee.
(Ord. 3327. Passed 5-16-07.)
929.08 MONTHLY RATE.
   The Council acting as the Board shall, by ordinance, establish the monthly
rate for the Stormwater Management Fee. The monthly rate shall be calculated to
insure adequate revenues to fund the costs of stormwater management and to
provide for the operation, maintenance, and capital improvements of the
stormwater system in the City.
(Ord. 3327. Passed 5-16-07.)
929.09 CHARGES FOR TAX-EXEMPT PROPERTIES; EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   Council finds that all real property in the City contributes to runoff
and either uses or benefits from the maintenance of the stormwater system.
Therefore, except as otherwise provided in this section, all real property in
the Village, including property that is tax exempt from property tax by the
State of Ohio Department of Assessments & Taxation.
   (b)   Property which is owned by the Village shall be exempt form the Fee.
   (c)   Undeveloped Property shall be exempt from the Fee.
(Ord. 3327. Passed 5-16-07.)
929.10 WHEN STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FEE PAYABLE; INTEREST AND PENALTIES; LIEN ON
REAL PROPERTY; ABATEMENT OF SMALL AMOUNTS DUE.
   (a)   The Fee that is due upon receipt.
   (b)   The Fee, including interest and penalties, when overdue is a lien on
real property and may be collected in the same manner as delinquent real
property taxes or by a suit against the property owner.
   (c)   The Village Administrator may abate the Fee, including penalties, if
the cost of collection is reasonably estimated to exceed the amount of the Fee,
including any interest and penalties, due and payable. (Ord. 3327. Passed 5-16-
07.)
929.11 REQUESTS FOR CORRECTION OF THE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FEE.
   (a)   A property owner may request correction of the Fee by submitting the
request in writing to the Village Administrator within thirty days after the
date the assessment notice or the bill is mailed or issued to the property
owner. Grounds for correction of the Fee include:
      (1)   Incorrect classification of the property for purposes of
determining the Fee
      (2)   Errors in the identification of the property owner of a property
subject to the Fee.
   (b)   The Village Administrator shall make a determination within thirty
days after receipt of the property owner’s completed written request for
correction of the Fee. The Village Administrator’s decision on a request for
correction of the Fee shall be final.
   (c)   A property owner must comply with all rules and procedures adopted by
the Village when submitting a request for correction of the Fee and must
provide all information necessary for the Village Administrator to make a
determination on a request for correction of the Fee. If a property owner
alleges an error under Section I, the request for correction must include a
certification by a registered engineer or professional land surveyor of the
impervious surface area of the property. Failure to comply with the provisions
of this subsection shall be grounds for denial of the request. (Ord. 3327.

      (4)   The Village of Lowellville or its Agents has the right to require
the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All
devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the Village of Lowellville or its
Agents and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be
borne by the operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Village of Lowellville or its
Agents access to a permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge
permit and of this ordinance. A person who is the operator of a facility with a
NPDES permit to discharge storm water associated with industrial activity
commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency
reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any
activity authorized or required by this ordinance.
      (7)   If the Village of Lowellville or its Agents has been refused access
to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is
able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of
this ordinance, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency
may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
         (Ord. 3328. Passed 5-16-07.)
933.11 BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES REQUIRED.
   The Village of Lowellville will adopt requirements identifying Best
Management Practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause
or contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain
system, or waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or
industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural
and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions
of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated
with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance
with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater
pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements
of the NPDES permit. (Ord. 3328. Passed 5-16-07.)
933.12 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 3328. Passed 5-16-07.)
933.13 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or water of the U.S. said
person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and
cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials
said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the
occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-
hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency
in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the
                                                                       the
Village of Lowellville or its Agents within three business days of the phone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall
also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three
years. (Ord. 3328. Passed 5-16-07.)
933.14 ENFORCEMENT.
   Whenever the Village of Lowellville finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the authorized
enforcement agency may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation:
   (a)    The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
   (b)    The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
   (c)    That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
   (d)   The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or contamination
hazards and the restoration of any affected property; and
   (e)    Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and
   (f)    The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
   If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation
or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should
the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the
work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the
expense thereof shall be charged to the violator.
(Ord. 3328. Passed 5-16-07.)
933.15 APPEAL OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation may appeal the determination of
the authorized enforcement agency. The notice of appeal must be received within
ten days from the date of the Notice of Violation. Hearing on the appeal before
the appropriate authority or his/her designee shall take place within fifteen
days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the
municipal authority or their designee shall be final.
(Ord. 3328. Passed 5-16-07.)
933.16 ENFORCEMENT MEASURES AFTER APPEAL.
   If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the Notice of Violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within ten
days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the decision of the
authorized enforcement agency, then representatives of the authorized
enforcement agency shall enter upon the subject private property and are
authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or
restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or
person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the government agency
or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth
above. (Ord. 3328. Passed 5-16-07.)
933.17 COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION.
   (a)   Within thirty days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the
property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative
costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of
the assessment within ten days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely
manner as determined by the decision of the municipal authority or by the
expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a
special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the
property for the amount of the assessment.
   (b)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall
become liable to the city by reason of such violation. The liability shall be
paid in not more than twelve equal payments. Interest at the rate of nine
percent (9%) per annum shall be assessed on the balance beginning on the 1st
day following discovery of the violation.
(Ord. 3328. Passed 5-16-07.)
933.18 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to
comply with any of the requirements of this chapter. If a person has violated
or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, the authorized
enforcement agency may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction
restraining the person from activities which would create further violations or
compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
(Ord. 3328. Passed 5-16-07.)
933.19 COMPENSATORY ACTION.

937.01 COMMUNITY.
   Throughout this regulation the Community shall mean the Village of
Lowellville, State of Ohio, and its designated agents and representatives.
(Ord. 3329. Passed 5-16-07.)
937.02 COMPREHENSIVE STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   The Post-Construction Water Quality Plan developed to meet this regulation
will be coordinated and combined with the Riparian and Wetland Setback Plan and
the Construction Site Conservation Plan that are developed for the same site.
These plans will be titled and numbered in one consecutive sequence to make a
Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan for the site. The Comprehensive Storm
Water Management Plan so developed will serve as the Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWP3) required by Ohio EPA as part of the NPDES Storm Water
Permit for General Construction. (Ord. 3329. Passed 5-16-07.)
937.03 PURPOSE.
   The intent of this regulation is to:
   (a)   Allow development while reducing damage to receiving water resources
and drainage systems that may be caused by new development or redevelopment
activities.
   (b)   Protect and maintain the receiving stream’s physical, chemical,
biological characteristics and stream functions.
   (c)   Provide perpetual management of storm water runoff quality and
quantity.
   (d)   Establish consistent technically feasible and operationally practical
standards to achieve a level of storm water quantity and quality control that
will minimize damage to public and private property and degradation of water
resources, and will promote and maintain the health, safety, and welfare of the
residents of the Village.
   (e)   Control storm water runoff resulting from soil disturbing activities.
   (f)   Preserve, to the maximum extent practicable (MEP), the natural
drainage characteristics of the building site.
   (g)   Preserve, to the maximum extent practicable (MEP), natural
infiltration and groundwater recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that
replenishes water resources, wetlands, and wells.
   (h)   Assure that storm water quality controls are incorporated into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage.
   (i)   Reduce the need for costly treatment and mitigation for the damage to
and loss of water resources that are the result of inadequate storm water
quality control.
   (j)   Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to address
problems caused by inadequate storm water quality control.
   (k)   Require the incorporation of water quality protection that encourages
and promotes habitat preservation into the construction of storm water
management practices.
   (l)   Ensure that all storm water quality practices are properly designed,
constructed, and maintained. (Ord. 3329. Passed 5-16-07.)
937.04  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   Neither submission of a plan under the provisions herein, nor compliance
with the provisions of these regulations, shall relieve any person or entity
from responsibility for damage to any person or property that is otherwise
imposed by law.
(Ord. 3329. Passed 5-16-07.)
937.05 CONFLICTS, SEVERABILITY, NUISANCES AND RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)   Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon land than is
imposed or required by other Community provisions of law, ordinance, contract
or deed, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail.
   (b)   If a court of competent jurisdiction declares any clause, section, or
provision of these regulations invalid or unconstitutional, the validity of the
remainder shall not be affected thereby.
   (c)   These regulations shall not be construed as authorizing any person to
maintain a private or public nuisance on their property. Compliance with the
provisions of this regulation shall not be a defense in any action to abate
such nuisance.
   (d)   Failure of the Village to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly
conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the owner from
the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting there from, and shall
not result in the City, its officers, employees, or agents being responsible
for any condition or damage resulting there from.
(Ord. 3329. Passed 5-16-07.)
937.06 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This chapter and its regulations shall become effective upon their passage.
(Ord. 3329. Passed 5-16-07.)
937.07 SCOPE.
   This chapter applies to development areas having new or relocated projects
involving highways, underground cables, pipelines, subdivisions, industrial
projects, commercial projects, building activities on farms, redevelopment of
urban areas and all other land uses not specifically exempted. This chapter
does not apply to:
   (a)   Land-disturbing activities related to producing agricultural crops or
Silviculture operations regulated by the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution
Abatement Rules (1501: 15-3-01 to 1501: 15-3-09 of the Ohio Administrative
Code) and existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
   (b)   Strip mining operations regulated by Chapter 1513 of the Ohio Revised
Code and existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
   (c)   Surface mining operations regulated by Chapter 1514 of the Ohio
Revised Code and existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
   (d)   Linear construction projects, (e.g., pipeline or utility line
installation), which do not result in the installation of impervious surface
and are independent of other construction projects (not part of a larger common
plan of development or sale). However, linear construction projects must be
designed to minimize the number of stream crossings and the width of
disturbance.
   (e)   Transportation projects that are subject to industry specific Ohio EPA
Rules are exempt from these rules.
   (f)   It is not the role of the community to point out each and every part
of the rules and how to implement them on the individual job sites. It is the
project owner’s responsibility to be proactive in meeting the intent, purpose
and requirements of these regulations. (Ord. 3329. Passed 5-16-07.)
937.08 CONSULTATIONS.
   In implementing these regulations the Village Engineer or other Village
officials may consult with the local county SWCD, state and federal agencies
and other technical experts as necessary. Any costs associated with such
consultations may be assessed to the applicant or his or her designated
representative. (Ord. 3329. Passed 5-16-07.)
937.09 POST-CONSTRUCTION WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN.
   In order to control Post-Construction water quality damage and damage to
public and private lands, the owner of each development area shall be
responsible for developing a Post-Construction Storm Water Management Plan.
   (a)   This plan will be combined with the Construction Site Conservation
Plan and the Riparian Setback and Wetland Setback Plans that are also developed
for the site.
   (b)   This plan will contain a description of controls appropriate for each
construction operation covered by these regulations, and the operator will
implement such controls in a timely manner.
   (c)   The BMPs used to satisfy the conditions of these regulations shall
meet the standards and specifications in the current edition of the Ohio Rain
Water and Land Development manual, ODOT Post-Construction storm water
standards, or other manual that is acceptable to the Community Engineer or Ohio
EPA.
   (d)   The plan must make use of the practices that preserve the existing
natural condition to the Maximum Extent Practicable (MEP).
   (e)   To meet the Post-Construction requirements of this regulation, the
Post-Construction Water Quality Plan must contain a description of the Post-
Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) that will be installed during
construction for the site and the rationale for their selection. The rationale
must address the anticipated impacts on the channel and floodplain morphology,
hydrology, and water quality.
   (f)   This plan will identify the person or entity responsible for continued
maintenance of all vegetative and/or mechanical BMPs for both the construction
and Post-Construction phases of the development.
   (g)   Long-term maintenance requirements and schedules of all BMPs for both
the construction and Post-Construction phases of the development will be
identified.
   (h)   This plan will contain long-term maintenance inspection schedules,
including the printed name and contact point of the Post-Construction landowner
(e.g., president of the homeowners association, store manager, apartment
complex manager, etc.).
   (i)   This plan will identify the person or entity financially responsible
for maintaining the permanent inspection and maintenance of permanent storm
water conveyance and storage structures and other conservation practices.
   (j)   The method of ensuring that funding will be available to conduct the
long-term maintenance and inspections of all permanent storm water, soil
erosion and sediment control and water quality practices will be identified.
   (k)   The Post-Construction Plan will also contain the following information
depending on the size of the development sites as well as any additional
information required by the community engineer:
      (1)   Development Sites Smaller than Five Acres:  A development site that
will disturb one (1) or more, but less than five (5) acres of land and is not a
part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five or
more acres of land shall identify:
         A.   Storm Water Issues: A statement as to how the decreased storm
water quality that will be caused by the planned development project will be
handled
         B.   Description of Measures: A description of the BMPs that will be
installed during the construction process to control pollutants in storm water
discharges that will occur after construction operations have been completed.
         C.   Upland Areas: Structural measures placed on upland areas to the
degree attainable.
         D.   Map: A map of the entire site showing the overall development.
         E.   Riparian and/or Wetland Setback: All riparian and wetland setback
areas will be identified on the plans. They will also be marked in the field
prior to the start of construction.
         F.   BMPs: Best Management Practices used in the Post-Construction
Water Quality Plan may include but are not limited to:
            1.   Permanent Storm Water Detention ponds that provide extended
detention of the water volume.
            2.   Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and natural
depressions
            3.   Onsite infiltration of runoff
            4.   Sequential systems that combine several practices
            5.   Permanent conservation easements, preferably with the easement
being held by a third party with no vested interest in ever seeing the property
developed
            6.   Natural Channel Design for drainageways
            7.   Bioengineering in drainageways
            8.   Recreating floodplains
            9.   Chemical and biological filters in storm sewer inlets
            10.   Sand Filters
            11.   Allowing roof water from buildings to run across lawn areas

            12.   Onsite sewage disposals system replacement or conversion to
sanitary sewers
            13.   Low Impact Development Design
            14.   Countryside Development Design meeting the criteria of the
Western Reserve Resource Conservation and Development Area.
            15.   Aquatic benches in Retention Basins and ponds.
         G.   Technical Basis: The plans will contain a rational statement
utilized to select the BMPs used to control pollution and to maintain and
protect water quality.
      (2)   Development Sites 5 Acres or Larger: A development site that
disturbs five (5) or more acres of land or will disturb less than five (5)
acres, but is a part of a larger common plan of development or sale, which will
disturb five (5) or more acres of land shall identify:
         A.   Storm Water Detention: The Post-Construction BMP(s) chosen must
be able to detain storm water runoff for protection of the stream channels,
stream erosion control, and improved water quality.
         B.   Structural BMPs:  Structural (designed) Post-Construction storm
water treatment practices shall be incorporated into the permanent drainage
system for the site.
         C.   Properly Sized BMPs: The BMP(s) chosen must be sized to treat the
water quality volume (WQv) and ensure compliance with Ohio’s Water Quality
Standards in OAC Chapter 3745-1.
            1.   The WQv shall be equivalent to the volume of runoff from a
0.75-inch rainfall and shall be determined according to one of the two
following methods:
            2.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the local
municipal permitting authority that uses continuous hydrologic simulation and
local long-term hourly precipitation records or
            3.   Using the following equation:
               a.   WQv = C * P * A / 12 where: WQv = water quality volume in
acre-feet C = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1 inch (see
Table 1) P = 0.75 inch precipitation depth A = area draining into the BMP in
acres
Table 1 Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
      (4)   Where the land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be
calculated using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing
drainage area to the storm water treatment structure is Low Density
Residential, 30% is High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff
coefficient is calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3) + (0.3)(0.5) + (0.1)(0.2) =
0.35.
      (5)   An additional volume equal to 20 percent of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the BMP for sediment storage and/or reduced infiltration
capacity. The BMPs will be designed according to the methodology included in
the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, ODOT Post-Construction storm
water standards, or other manual that is acceptable to Ohio EPA. .
      (6)   BMPs shall be designed such that the drain time is long enough to
provide treatment, but short enough to provide storage available for successive
rainfall events as described in Table 2 below
Table 2: Target Draw Down (Drain) Times for Structural Post-Construction
Treatment Control Practices
 
Best Management Practice                    Drain Time of WQv
Infiltration                                24 - 48 hours
Vegetated Swale and Filter Strip            24 hours
Extended Detention Basin (Dry Basins)       48 hours
Retention Basins (Wet Basins)*              24 hours
Constructed Wetlands (above permanent pool) 24 hours
Media Filtration, Bioretention              40 hours
      •   Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above
the permanent pool, each sized at 0.75 * WQv
      (7)   The owner may request approval from the Village Engineer to use
alternative structural Post-Construction BMPs if the owner can demonstrate, in
a way that is acceptable to Ohio EPA rules and regulations, that the
alternative BMPs are equivalent in effectiveness to those listed in Table 2
above. The use of alternative or vender supplied Post-Construction BMPs should
be limited to redevelopment projects where justification is provided that the
traditional BMPs in Table 2 are technically and economically infeasible.
      (8)   Construction activities shall be exempt from this condition if it
can be demonstrated that the WQv is provided within an existing structural
Post-Construction BMP that is part of a larger common plan of development or
sale or if structural Post-Construction BMPs are addressed in a regional or
local storm water management plan.
      (9)   For redevelopment projects (i.e., developments on previously
developed property), Post-Construction practices shall either ensure a 20
percent net reduction of the site impervious area, provide for treatment of at
least 20 percent of the WQv, or a combination of the two.
      (10)   Site Description:
         A.   The prior land uses of the site
         B.   The nature and type of construction activity (e.g., low density
residential, shopping mall, highway, etc.)
         C.   Total area of the site and the area of the site that is expected
to be disturbed (i.e., grubbing, clearing, excavating, filling or grading,
including off-site borrow, fill or spoil areas and off-site utility
installation areas)
         D.   Amount of the impervious area and percent imperviousness created
by the construction activity
         E.   Name and/or location of the immediate receiving stream or surface
water(s) and the first subsequent named receiving water and the major river
watersheds in which it is located.
      (11)   A vicinity sketch locating:
         A.   The development area
         B.   The larger common plan of development or sale
         C.   All pertinent surrounding natural features within 200 feet of the
development site including, but not limited to:
         D.   Water resources such as wetlands, springs, lakes, ponds, rivers
and streams (including intermittent streams with a defined bed and bank)
         E.   Conservation Easements
         F.   Other sensitive natural resources and areas receiving runoff from
the development
      (12)   The existing and proposed topography shown in the appropriate
contour intervals as determined by the community engineer (generally one-foot
contours are used).
      (13)   The location and description of existing and proposed drainage
patterns and facilities, including any allied drainage facilities beyond the
development area and the larger common plan of development or sale.
      (14)   Existing and proposed watershed boundary lines, direction of flow
and watershed acreage.
      (15)   The person or entity responsible for continued maintenance of all
permanent vegetative and/or mechanical Post-Construction water quality
conservation practices (BMPs).
      (16)   The location of any existing or planned riparian and/or wetland
setback areas on the property. (Ord. 3329. Passed 5-16-07.)
937.10 EASEMENTS.
   Future access to all permanent vegetative and/or mechanical Post-
Construction water quality conservation practices (BMPs) and other areas, as
required by the Village Engineer, shall be secured by means of easements.
   (a)   The easements shall be recorded in the name of the Village and, in
single-family residential developments, the homeowners association.
   (b)   Such easements shall be not less than twenty-five (25) feet in width,
in addition to the width of the ditch, channel, or other facility it is to

941.01 COMMUNITY.
   Throughout this regulation the Community shall mean the Village of
Lowellville, State of Ohio, and its designated agents and representatives.
(Ord. 3330. Passed 5-16-07.)
941.02 COMPREHENSIVE STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN.
    The Construction Site Conservation Plan developed to meet this regulation
will be coordinated and combined with the Riparian and Wetland Setback Plan and
the Post-Construction Water Quality Plan that are developed for the same site.
These plans will be titled and numbered in one consecutive sequence to make a
Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan for the site. The Comprehensive Storm
Water Management Plan so developed will serve as the Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWP3) required by Ohio EPA as part of the NPDES Storm Water
Permit for General Construction. (Ord. 3330. Passed 5-16-07.)
941.03 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The intent of this regulation is to establish consistent technically
feasible and operationally practical standards to achieve a level of storm
water management, and erosion and sediment control that will minimize damage to
public and private property and the degradation of water resources, and will
promote and maintain the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the
Community.  
   (b)   This regulation further intends, but is not limited, to:
      (1)   Allow development while minimizing increases in downstream
flooding, erosion, and sedimentation.
      (2)   Reduce damage to receiving water resources and drainage systems
that are caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control storm water runoff resulting from soil disturbing
activities.
      (4)   Assure that development site owners control the volume and rate of
storm water runoff originating from their property so that surface water and
ground water are protected, soil erosion is controlled, and flooding potential
is not increased.
      (5)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable the natural drainage
characteristics of the building site and minimize the need to construct,
repair, and replace enclosed storm drain systems.
      (6)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water
resources, wetlands, and wells.
      (7)   Assure that storm water controls are incorporated into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage.
      (8)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil,
especially adjacent to water resources and wetlands.
      (9)   Reduce the need for costly maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments, sewage systems, ditches, water resources, wetlands, and storm
water management practices that are the result of inadequate soil erosion,
sediment and storm water control.
      (10)   Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to
address problems caused by inadequate storm water, erosion and sediment
control.
      (11)   Require the construction of storm water management practices that
serve multiple purposes including flood control, soil erosion and sediment
control, and require water quality protection; and encourage such practices
that promote recreation and habitat preservation.
      (12)   Ensure that all storm water management, soil erosion and sediment
control practices are properly designed, constructed, and maintained.
         (Ord. 3330. Passed 5-16-07.)
941.04 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   Neither submission of a plan under the provisions herein, nor compliance
with the provisions of these regulations, shall relieve any person or entity
from responsibility for damage to any person or property that is otherwise
imposed by law.
(Ord. 3330. Passed 5-16-07.)
941.05 CONFLICTS, SEVERABILITY, NUISANCES AND RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)   Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon land than is
imposed or required by other Community provisions of law, ordinance, contract
or deed, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail.
   (b)   If a court of competent jurisdiction declares any clause, section, or
provision of these regulations invalid or unconstitutional, the validity of the
remainder shall not be affected thereby.
   (c)   These regulations shall not be construed as authorizing any person to
maintain a private or public nuisance on their property. Compliance with the
provisions of this regulation shall not be a defense in any action to abate
such nuisance.
   (d)   Failure of the Community to observe or recognize hazardous or
unsightly conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the
owner from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting there from,
and shall not result in the Community, its officers, employees, or agents being
responsible for any condition or damage resulting there from.
(Ord. 3330. Passed 5-16-07.)
941.06 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This chapter and its regulations shall become effective upon their passage.
(Ord. 3330. Passed 5-16-07.)
941.07 SCOPE.
   This chapter applies to development areas having new or relocated projects
involving highways, underground cables, pipelines, subdivisions, industrial
projects, commercial projects, building activities on farms, redevelopment of
urban areas and all other land uses not specifically exempted. This ordinance
does not apply to:
   (a)   Land disturbing activities related to producing agricultural crops or
Silviculture operations regulated by the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution
Abatement Rules (1501: 15-3-01 to 1501: 15-3-09 of the Ohio Administrative
Code) and existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
   (b)   Coal surface mining operations regulated by Chapter 1513 of the Ohio
Revised Code and existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
   (c)   Other surface mining operations regulated by Chapter 1514 of the Ohio
Revised Code and existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
      (Ord. 3330. Passed 5-16-07.)
941.08 CONSULTATIONS.
   In implementing these regulations the Community Engineer or other Community
officials may consult with the local county SWCD, state and federal agencies
and other technical experts as necessary. Any costs associated with such
consultations may be assessed to the applicant or his or her designated
representative.
   (a)   The issuance of two building permits is an option that is recommended
in order to ensure compliance with having the required BMPs installed with the
minimal use of inspectors and enforcement time. This option applies to single-
family residential construction and other similar types of construction. By
using this two building permit approach the community can use positive
reinforcement by issuing the second building permit AFTER the required BMPS
have been installed instead of using negative enforcement such as stop work
orders, fines and jail time
   (b)   Two versions of a Temporary Seeding table are found in the Minimum
Standards section of this model ordinance. The one that is selected will be
determined by which option the community selects in this section.
      (Ord. 3330. Passed 5-16-07.)
941.09 ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS FOR RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS.
   (a)   Two building permits will be issued for all single-family residential
construction and similar types of construction as determined by the community
engineer. The first building permit shall allow the construction of the footers
and basement walls or slab. No additional construction shall be performed and
no additional building materials shall be allowed on the site until the
Community has issued the second building permit. The Community Engineer may
approve the stockpiling of additional construction materials on the site prior
to the issuance of the second permit if a suitable location can be identified.
Proper Soil Erosion and Sediment Control must be maintained on the stockpile
area prior to, during, and after the area is used for stockpiling.
   (b)   The second building permit, allowing delivery of the remaining
building materials and the remaining construction activities, shall not be
issued until the Community Engineer certifies that the required BMPs and any
other BMPs identified in the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan submitted
with the Application for the first building permit have been properly
installed, pursuant to the most recent edition of the Ohio Rainwater and
Land Development manual. (Ord. 3330. Passed 5-16-07.)
941.10 CONSTRUCTION SITE CONSERVATION PLAN.
   In order to control storm water damage and sediment pollution of water
resources, wetlands, riparian areas, other natural areas, and public and
private lands, the owner of each development area shall be responsible for
developing a comprehensive Construction Site Conservation Plan. This plan will
address storm water management (volume and peak rate of runoff), soil erosion,
sediment and other wastes control. This plan must contain a description of
controls appropriate for each construction operation covered by these
regulations, and the operator must implement the planned controls in a timely
manner. The plans and BMPs used to satisfy the conditions of these regulations
shall meet the standards and specifications in the current edition of the Ohio
Rain Water and Land Development manual. The plans must make use of the
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the Maximum Extent
Practicable.
•   If the community intends to require soil erosion, sediment and storm water
management controls on construction sites that disturb less than 1 acre (43,560
square feet) the next section should be included. This section needs to be
deleted if small construction sites are not to be regulated by this ordinance.
   •   The lower limit of 8,000 square feet of disturbed land area is used in
this model because at least one community in northeast Ohio has used this
threshold for several years. The Community can select an alternative threshold
value of its choosing not to exceed 1 acre in size.

requested permit(s). The abbreviated plan must cover the following items, in
addition to any other items from this ordinance that are required by the
Community Engineer.
      (1)   Storm Water Issues: A statement as to how the increased storm water
runoff that will be caused by the planned development project will be handled.
This statement must identify the Best Management Practices (BMPs) the new
construction project will include in order to address storm water runoff.
      (2)   Redevelopment Exemption: Owners of development sites that were
created by demolishing an older existing structure can request, in writing,
that the Community Engineer exempt them from the storm water issues if the
total soil surface area being made impermeable is the same or less than the
total soil surface area that was impermeable due to the structure(s) being torn
down and removed.
      (3)   Riparian and Wetland Setbacks: All riparian and wetland setback
areas will be identified in the plan and in the field before construction
starts.
      (4)   Soil Erosion and Sediment Issues: A sketch of the entire
development site must be submitted that identifies the location of:
         A.   All existing and planned impervious areas, storm water inlets,
drainage swales, wetlands, streams, conservation easements and other natural
features to be saved and protected on the property.

authorizes them to design the same type of BMP for construction.
         (Ord. 3330. Passed 5-16-07.)
941.13 MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the owner or
person responsible for the development area shall use conservation planning and
practices to maintain the level of conservation established in the following
standards.
   (a)   The plan shall include measures that control the flow of runoff from
disturbed areas so as to prevent soil erosion from occurring.
   (b)   Structural Practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from areas remaining disturbed for more than fourteen days.
   (c)   Sediment Barriers: Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be
intercepted by Silt Fence or Diversions to protect adjacent properties and
water resources from sediment. Where intended to provide sediment control, Silt
Fence shall be placed on a level contour. The relationship between the maximum
drainage areas to Silt Fence for a particular slope is shown in the table
below.
Table 1: Silt Fence Applicability
 
Maximum drainage area (in acres) to 100 Range of slope for a particular
linear feet of Silt Fence               drainage area (in percent)
0.5                                     < 2%
0.25                                    > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                   > 20% but < 50%
   This does not preclude the use of other sediment barriers designed to
control sheet flow runoff. The total runoff flow treated by a sediment barrier
shall not exceed the design capacity for that sediment barrier. Straw Bale
Barriers are not acceptable.
   (d)   Storm Water Diversion Practices: Storm water diversion practices shall
be used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Such practices, which include Swales, Dikes or Berms, Pipe Slope
Drains and Diversions, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to ten (10)
acres. Storm water diversion practices alone are not considered a sediment
control practice unless those are used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional.
   (f)   Clearing and Grubbing will be done in two (2) or more phases. The
first phase will include only those locations necessary to install the
perimeter soil erosion, sediment and storm water control BMPs. After the
perimeter controls are in place and functioning, the remaining phase(s) of
clearing and grubbing may continue.
   (g)   Timing of Sediment Trapping Practices: Sediment control practices
shall be functional throughout all phases of up slope earth disturbing
activity. Settling facilities, perimeter controls and other practices intended
to trap sediment shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7)
days from the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up
slope development area is permanently restabilized. As construction progresses
and the topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or
existing controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
   (h)   Stabilization of Denuded Areas: Disturbed areas must be stabilized as
specified in the tables below, or according to the Ohio EPA NPDES Storm Water
Permit Rules, whichever is most restrictive:
Table 2: Permanent Stabilization

Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural instability or
are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques.
   (i)   Sediment Settling Ponds: Storm water runoff that exceeds the design
capacity of sediment barriers and concentrated storm water flows shall pass
through a sediment settling facility.
      (1)   Where storm sewer drainage areas include 10 or more acres disturbed
at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment settling pond must be provided
until final stabilization of the site. In single-family residential
construction, final stabilization is after the houses are built and permanent
landscaping is done.
         A.   Alternative equivalent controls may be used if the owner can
show, in writing, that the Ohio EPA approved the use the alternatives in the
(Ohio EPA NPDES Permit for Construction Activity) Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWP3) for the site.
         B.   It is recommended that for drainage locations of less than 10
acres, smaller sediment settling basins and/or Sediment Traps be used.
      (2)   Each facility's storage capacity shall be no less than sixty-seven
(67) cubic yards per acre of total contributing drainage area. The storage
volume will be measured from the bottom of the basin to the top of the primary
(principle) spillway.
      (3)   Permanent storm water management ponds that are designed to trap
sediment during construction shall be designed to provide for a slow release of
sediment-laden water. The draw down time must be at least 72 hours, or meet the
criteria in the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual whichever is most
stringent.
      (4)   The design configuration between inlet(s) and the outlet of
settling ponds must provide at least two units of length for each one unit of
width (> 2:1 length to width ratio).
      (5)   The depth of the sediment settling pond must be less than or equal
to five (5) feet.
      (6)   Sediment must be removed from the sediment settling ponds when the
design capacity has been reduced by 40%.
      (7)   Public safety, especially as it relates to children, must be
considered in the design. Alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design.
      (8)   Temporary sediment settling ponds will not be constructed in any
stream channel.
   (j)   Storm Sewer Inlet Protection:
      (1)   All storm sewer inlets that accept water runoff from the
development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter
the storm sewer, unless the storm drain system drains to a Sediment Settling
Pond and is exempted in writing by the Community Engineer. In areas where
construction will be ongoing, such as subdivisions, the storm sewer protection
shall be maintained until all up slope areas reach final stabilization, as
determined by the Community Engineer.
      (2)   At the end of this period the site owner shall hydraulically clean
the storm sewers to the satisfaction of the Community Engineer. All sediments
shall be removed from the system and shall not be flushed downstream.
   (k)   Storm Sewer & Other Drainage Outlets: All storm sewers, footer drains,
roof gutter drains and all other drains will be outletted at the bottom of the
slope. The slope below the outlet will be able to control the water being
drained through the storm sewer or other drains without causing erosion of the
stream or channel banks or channel bottom or other areas that the water is
outletted on.
   (l)   Working Near, Or Crossing Streams and Wetlands:
      (1)   Construction vehicles shall avoid water resources, wetlands,
riparian areas, and their setbacks. If construction vehicles must cross these
areas during construction, an approved temporary crossing shall be constructed.
Streams, including intermittent streams with a defined bed and banks, shall be
restabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed, interrupted, or
stopped. Erodible materials will not be used in making stream crossings.
      (2)   No soil, rock, debris, or any other material shall be dumped or
placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may slough, slip,
or erode into a water resource unless such dumping or placing is authorized by
the approving authority and, when applicable, the US Army Corps Of Engineers
and Ohio EPA, for such purposes as, but not limited to, constructing bridges,
culverts, and erosion or sediment control structures.
      (3)   If construction activities disturb areas adjacent to streams,
structural practices shall be designed and implemented on site to protect the
adjacent streams from the impacts of sediment runoff.
      (4)   No temporary or permanent sediment controls will be constructed in
a stream channel.
      (5)   Streams and wetland setbacks required by the community will be
implemented. As a minimum a setback of 25 feet, as measured from the ordinary
high water mark of the surface water, will be maintained in its natural state
as a permanent buffer.
   (m)   Construction Entrance:
      (1)   Measures shall be taken to prevent soil transport onto public
roads, or surfaces where runoff is not checked by sediment controls.
      (2)   Stone with geotextile construction entrance(s) shall be implemented
as required by the Community Engineer and the Ohio EPA. These will be planned
and installed according to the requirements in the most recent edition of the
Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual.
      (3)   Where soil is transported onto a public road surface, the roads
shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day, or more frequently, in
order to ensure public safety. Soil shall be removed from paved surfaces by
shoveling or sweeping. Street washing shall be allowed only after shoveling or
sweeping has removed most of the sediment and street sewer inlet protection is
properly installed unless end of sewer sediment ponds exist and are properly
functioning.
      (4)   Erodible material ramps in streets will not be used to enable
equipment to cross curbs. Non-erosive materials (e.g. wood and stone) can be
used.
   (n)   Unstable Soils:
      (1)   Unstable soils will be as determined by the local county Soil
Survey or by a detailed soils report.
      (2)   The Community Engineer may require detailed soil reports when
deemed necessary.
      (3)   Unstable soils prone to slipping or land sliding shall not be
graded, excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is
performed in accordance with a qualified professional engineer's
recommendations to correct, eliminate, or adequately address the problems.
   (o)   Cut And Fill Slopes: Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion and slippage. Consideration
shall be given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, up slope
drainage area, groundwater conditions and slope stabilization. The minimum
final unreinforced soil slopes will have a horizontal to vertical ratio of 2:1
(the horizontal will be two (2) times the vertical).
   (p)   Stabilization of Outfalls and Channels: Outfalls and constructed or
modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected
velocity of flow from the planned post-development frequency storm without
eroding. The planned post-construction velocity and flow shall include the
entire contributing watershed.
   (q)   Establishment of Permanent Vegetation: A permanent vegetative cover
shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized.
Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until ground cover is
achieved which, in the opinion of the Community Engineer, has 80% vegetative
density over the entire disturbed area and provides adequate cover, and is
mature enough to satisfactorily control soil erosion and survive adverse
weather conditions.
   (r)   Disposition of Temporary Practices: All temporary soil erosion and
sediment control practices shall be disposed of immediately after final site
stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are no longer
needed, unless otherwise required by the Community Engineer. Trapped sediment
shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion. The Construction
Maintenance Guarantee shall not be released by the Community until all
temporary soil erosion and sediment control practices that are no longer needed
have been removed, properly disposed of and any trapped sediment has been
stabilized.
   (s)   Underground Utility Construction: The construction of underground
utility lines, pipes, etc. shall be subject to the following criteria:
      (1)   Trenches shall remain open for no more than five days.
      (2)   There shall be no turbid discharges to surface waters resulting
from dewatering activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it
must pass through a sediment settling pond or other equally effective sediment
control device, prior to being discharged from the construction site or to
waters of the state.
      (3)   When discharging clean ground water care must be taken to ensure
that it does not become pollutant laden by crossing over disturbed soils or
other pollutant sources.
   (t)   Inspections:
      (1)   If inspections or other information indicates a control has been
used inappropriately or incorrectly or it has failed, it must be replaced or
modified for the site conditions.
      (2)   The owner of the development area shall have the site inspected for
soil erosion, sediment control and other environmental concerns every seven (7)
calendar days, and within twenty-four (24) hours of a 0.5 inch or greater
rainfall event until the Community Engineer certifies the site as being stable.
The Community Engineer certification does not relieve the permittee from
meeting the Ohio EPA NPDES inspection requirements.
      (3)   The owner, or his designated representative, shall keep a written
log of each inspection and any subsequent improvements to the soil erosion,
sediment control or other environmental controls. The inspections shall include
the date of the inspection, the name of the inspector, weather conditions, and
the actions needed to correct the identified problems.
      (4)   The inspection log will include the date and actions taken to
correct problems noted in past inspection logs.
      (5)   If the construction site is subject to Ohio EPA's National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for construction
activity, a copy of all of the required inspection sheets will be submitted to
the Community Engineer within three (3) working days of the date that the
inspection was conducted.
      (6)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (7)   Erosion and sediment controls identified in the Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan shall be observed to ensure that they are operating
correctly.
      (8)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to ascertain whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving waters.
      (9)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (10)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of
repair or maintenance, with the exception of sediment settling ponds, it must
be repaired or maintained within three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment
settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the
inspection.
      (11)   If any inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform
its intended function and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the Construction Site Conservation Plan must be amended and the new
control practice must be installed within 10 days of the inspection.
      (12)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice has not been
implemented in the time required by this ordinance it must be installed within
ten (10) days from the date of inspection.
      (13)   If the inspection reveals that a planned control practice is not
needed, the record must contain a statement of explanation as to why the
control practice is not needed.
   (u)   Control of Materials and Debris: Site management practices shall be
implemented to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris
from entering the Community’s and state’s water resources or wetlands. These
practices shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   A covered dumpster shall be made available for the proper disposal
of construction site waste materials, garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum
and etc. A second covered dumpster will be provided for the proper disposal of
toxic and hazardous wastes.
      (2)   The washing of excess concrete material into a street, catch basin,
or other public facility or natural resource shall not occur. A designated area
for concrete washouts shall be made available and used for all concrete
washouts.
      (3)   All fuel tanks and drums shall be stored in a marked storage area.
A dike shall be constructed around this storage area with a minimum capacity
equal to 110% of the volume of the largest container in the storage area. All
additional requirements of the local fire authority must be followed. If the
fuel tanks have a self-contained “dike,” the plug will be kept in the “dike”
tank at all times.
      (4)   Any toxic or hazardous wastes and/or contaminated soils must be
disposed of according to all applicable environmental laws and statutes. Local
health districts and Ohio EPA can provide guidance on these issues.
      (5)   On a site with a prior industrial landuse or a site that is
contaminated with gasoline, fuel oil, hydrocarbon based chemicals or other Ohio
EPA regulated contaminates, the storm water is considered wastewater. A permit
from Ohio EPA is required to address these sites.
      (6)   Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid
waste landfill sites.
      (7)   Paint, paint washing liquids, excess paints and other paint wastes
are considered solid wastes and shall be disposed of in accordance with
applicable state regulations. Appropriate handling of these wastes shall occur
at the site so as to prevent the discharge of these wastes into surface or
ground waters.
         A.   Water based paint washing liquids and small quantities of excess
water based paints may be disposed of by flushing down a connected sanitary
sewer but may not be disposed of in an on-lot disposal system.
         B.   All other paints, paint thinners, and paint cleaning materials
will be disposed of in the site’s hazardous waste disposal dumpster.
      (8)   Restroom facilities will be provided for site workers at all times
that workers are present on the site and during all phases of the construction.
      (9)   All required permits from appropriate federal, state, or local
agencies are required to develop land with a previous industrial or commercial
use or another use that may have led to soil contamination by a regulated
pollutant.
   (v)   Pre-winter Stabilization: If the development area will, or is planned
to remain, active through the winter months, the owner of the development area
shall hold a Pre-Winter Stabilization Meeting. The meeting will be held before
October 1st. The owner shall invite the operator, developer, engineer,
contractor, Community Engineer and anyone else requested by the Community
Engineer to the meeting.
   (w)   Storm Water Basins:
      (1)   Pool Geometry: The minimum length-to-width ratio for the pond is 3:
1 (the length will be three (3) times the width).
      (2)   Riser in Embankment: The riser shall be located within the
embankment for purposes of maintenance access. Access to the riser will be by
manholes.
      (3)   Water Drains: Each retention basin shall have a drainpipe that can
completely drain the pond. The drain shall have an elbow within the pond to
prevent sediment deposition from plugging the drain.
      (4)   Adjustable Gate Valves: Both the storm water management and water
quality basin drains shall have adjustable gate valves. Valves shall be located
inside the riser at a point where they will remain dry and can be operated in a
safe and convenient manner. During the annual inspections the valves shall be
fully opened and closed at least once, and the certifying official shall attest
to this on the inspection form. To prevent vandalism, the handwheel shall be
chained to a ringbolt or manhole step.
      (5)   Principal Spillway: Each principal spillway shall be designed in
accordance with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving
the county. Each principal spillway shall have the capacity to pass the 100-
year design storm flow. The inlet or riser size for the pipe drops shall be
designed so that the flow through the structure goes from weir flow control to
pipe flow control without going into orifice control in the riser. The crest
elevation of the primary spillway shall be no less than one foot below the
emergency spillway crest. Premium joint pipe is required and a removable trash
rack shall be installed at each location. Anti-seep collars shall be provided
for all pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (6)   Emergency Spillway: An emergency spillway shall be provided on each
storm water management basin. Emergency spillways shall convey flood flows
safely past the embankment, and shall be designed in accordance with NRCS
standards and specifications for the office serving the local county. Emergency
spillways shall have a 100-year design storm capacity unless exempted in
writing by the Community Engineer.
      (7)   Embankments: Each dam embankment shall be designed in accordance
with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving the county
that the project is located in. Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all
pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (8)   Safety Features:
         A.   The primary spillway opening shall not permit access to the
public and other non-maintenance personnel.
         B.   The perimeter of all water pool areas that are deeper than three
(3) feet shall be surrounded by benches that meet the following:
            1.   A safety bench, with a maximum slope of 3%, which extends
outward, on dry land, from the shoreline. This bench will be a minimum of 25
feet wide to provide for the safety of individuals and maintenance vehicles
that are adjacent to the water pool. The safety bench may be landscaped,
without the use of structures, to prevent access to the water pool.
            2.   Side slopes between the safety bench and the aquatic bench
shall not be steeper than 3:1 (3 feet horizontal for every 1 foot vertical).
            3.   An aquatic bench that extends inward from the shoreline far
enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of 15 inches below the
normal water surface elevations. The aquatic bench may be landscaped to prevent
access to the deeper water pool.
            4.   Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and below the permanent
water level shall not be steeper than 2:1 (2 feet horizontal for every 1 foot
vertical).
            5.   The contours of the pond will be designed and managed to
eliminate drop-offs and other hazards.
            6.   Side slopes getting to the pond shall not exceed 3:1 and shall
terminate on a safety bench.
            7.   Soil erosion and sediment control practices used to satisfy
these standards shall meet the standards and specifications in the current
edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, NRCS Field Office
Technical Guide for the local county or the Ohio EPA, which ever is most
stringent.
   (x)   These standards are general guidelines and shall not limit the right
of the Community Engineer to impose at any time additional, more stringent
requirements, nor shall the standards limit the right of the Community Engineer
to waive, in writing, individual requirements.
   (y)   Soil limitations shall be determined by using the current edition of
the county soil survey written by the NRCS, USDA.
   (z)   Methods for controlling increases in storm water runoff peaks and
volumes may include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Retarding flow velocities by increasing friction; for example,
grassed road ditches rather than paved street gutters where practical,
discharging roof water to vegetated areas, or grass and rock-lined drainage
channels.
      (2)   Grading and use of grade control structures to provide a level of
control in flow paths and stream gradients.
      (3)   Induced infiltration of increased storm water runoff into soil,
where practical; for example, constructing special infiltration areas where
soils are suitable, retaining topsoil for all areas to be vegetated, or
providing good infiltration areas with proper emergency overflow facilities.
      (4)   Provisions for detention and retention, for example, permanent
retention ponds and lakes, dry detention basins, and subsurface detention
tanks.
         (Ord. 3330. Passed 5-16-07.)
941.14 STREAM CHANNEL AND FLOODPLAIN EROSION DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (a)   Runoff Rate: The peak runoff rate from the development area shall not
be greater after development than it was before development. The applicant
shall provide calculations proving no increase in the runoff rates from the one
(1), two (2), five (5), ten (10), twenty-five (25), fifty (50) and one hundred
(100) year storms.
   (b)   Runoff Volume: Increases in the runoff volume shall be offset by
further restricting runoff rates. Based on the increase in runoff volume, the
applicant shall determine the critical storm for the development area. The
runoff rate from the critical storm shall be restricted to the one (1) year
pre-development storm runoff rate. The critical storm shall be calculated as
follows:
      (1)   Determine the total volume of runoff from a one-year frequency,
twenty-four hour storm, occurring on the development area before and after
development.
      (2)   From the volumes in subsection (a) determine the percent of
increase in volume of runoff due to development according to the equation (Q
after divided by the Q before) X 100 and, using this percentage, select the
critical storm from this table:
Table 4: Critical Storm Selection
The Percentage Increase In Volume Of Runoff Is:
Equal To Or  And Less Than The 24-Hour “Critical Storm” For Discharge Will Be
Greater Than
0            10            1 Year
10           20            2 Years
20           50            5 Years
50           100           10 Years
100          250           25 Years
250          500           50 Years
500          ----          100 Years
 
   (c)   Detention Or Retention Basin Exemption For Redevelopment Or For
Expansion Of Existing Facilities:
      (1)   For any development regulated by this ordinance, the construction
of a detention or retention basin may not be required for the development if
the post-development peak discharge for a 100 year frequency 24 hour storm
increases the existing peak discharge by one (1) cubic foot per second or less
using the TR-55 method of calculation or other method approved by the Community
Engineer. The Community Engineer can waive this requirement if existing storm
sewers and drainage structures can safely handle the expected increase in flow.
      (2)   Only one (1) exemption will be allowed per parcel. Any subsequent
expansion must provide for detention or retention and must include the
previously exempted area.
   (d)   Where the Community Engineer determines that site constraints exist in
a manner that compromises the intent of this ordinance to improve the
management of storm water runoff as established in this section, practical
alternatives may be used to result in an improvement of water quality and/or a
reduction of storm water runoff. Such alternatives must be in keeping with the
intent and likely cost of those measures that would otherwise be required to
meet the objectives of this section. When possible, all practical alternatives

storm water, soil erosion, sediment, or other wastes control or water quality
practice prior to the approval of the final plat where, in the Community
Engineer’s judgment, such proper construction or installation is not
immediately necessary for the protection of the public health and safety; and
where the prior installation or construction of such improvement would
constitute an undue hardship on the owner because in the case of new vegetation
or weather conditions, or because in the case of concrete, building
construction could cause cracking and excessive wear and tear on new
structures. In such event, the Community shall require a Security Bond, Escrow
Account, Certified Check or Cash to guarantee that such deferred improvements
will be properly constructed or installed within an agreed specified time, but
not to exceed six (6) months after the filing of such final plat.
   The owner will provide a maintenance guarantee for all permanent
improvements, and soil erosion, wastes controls, and water quality practices.
   The Community shall require a Security Bond, Escrow Account, Certified Check
or Cash to guarantee that the planned temporary and permanent soil erosion,
sediment, and other wastes controls and water quality practices will be
constructed and removed in a timely manner, as determined by the Community
Engineer.
   (a)   The Guarantee: The guarantee of both performance and maintenance will
be in the form of a Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash. The
Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash will be used by the
Community to complete any guaranteed construction or removal of improvements or
temporary and permanent soil erosion, sediment, and other wastes control
practices that are not adequately completed, maintained or removed by the owner
in a timely manner, as determined by the Community Engineer. The Security Bond,
Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash will be in the total amount of both the
performance guarantee and the maintenance guarantee. Ohio municipalities and
counties may require performance bonds or other guarantees for water management
improvement as stated in the Ohio R.C. Chapter 711.101.
      (1)   Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash shall be
deposited with the Community prior to review by the Community Engineer and/or
its consultants to cover professional services of the Community Engineer,
Building Commissioner, Zoning Inspector and/or other experts required by the
Community Engineer, Community Council, Mayor or Review Boards.
      (2)   No soil disturbing activities shall be permitted until a Security
Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash has been posted to the
satisfaction of the Community Engineer sufficient for the Community to perform
the obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner or person responsible
for the development area as stated in this regulation, and to allow all work to
be performed as needed in the event that the owner or person responsible for
the development area fails to comply with the provisions of this regulation.
The Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash shall be released
only after all work required by this regulation has been completed to the
satisfaction of the Community Engineer and all permit and inspection fees
required by these regulations have been paid in full.
      (3)   No project subject to this regulation shall commence without the
Construction Site Conservation Plan having been approved by the Community
Engineer.
   (b)   Performance Guarantee: The furnishing of a performance guarantee will
be maintained in an amount of not less than 120% of the estimate approved by
the Community Engineer, of installation of the deferred improvements.
   (c)   Maintenance Guarantee: The maintenance guarantee shall be maintained
for a period of not less than 2 (two) years after final acceptance of the storm
water, soil erosion, sediment, and other wastes control practices in an amount
equal to 20% of the estimate approved by the Community Engineer, of the
construction and, where necessary, removal of such practices.
   (d)   Time Extension: The Community Engineer may extend for cause the time
allowed for the installation of the improvements for which the performance
guarantee has been provided with the receipt of a written request from the
owner.
   (e)   Completion: Upon completion of the construction of improvements or
temporary and/or permanent, soil erosion, sediment, and other wastes control
practices and the removal of the temporary soil erosion, sediment, and other
wastes control practices for which the performance guarantee has been provided
the owner shall notify the Community Engineer of this fact.
   (f)   Inspection: The Community will not release the Security Bond, Escrow
Account, Verified Check or Cash guarantee until the Community Engineer has
inspected the site to ensure that the guaranteed item(s) have been completed
and/or removed.
   (g)   Slow Release Devices: Performance and maintenance guarantees will be
maintained on the temporary sediment removal slow release devices installed in
detention and retention basins until the entire site has reached final soil
stabilization. Final stabilization in single-family residential developments is
when 90% of the homes are constructed with their lawns completely installed and
any remaining unbuilt lots having been permanently stabilized with a uniform
ground cover at a growth density of 80% or better.
   (h)   Release: The Construction Maintenance Guarantee shall not be released
by the Community until all temporary soil erosion and sediment control
practices that are no longer needed have been removed, properly disposed of and
any trapped sediment has been stabilized.

accommodation may be necessary to ensure equal access to housing, at the outset
or during the approval process.
(Ord. 4097. Passed 6-14-23.)
1133.05 REVIEW OF REQUESTS FOR REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION.
   (a)   The procedure used by the Village to review a request for reasonable
accommodation is dependent on the type of accommodation requested: variance,
conditional use, or appeal of a zoning violation citation. The Zoning Inspector
will assist applicants for a reasonable accommodation to determine which
procedure to follow.
      (1)   Variance.
         A.   A request for a reasonable accommodation may require a variance,
which can be granted only by the BZA.
         B.   If a request for a reasonable accommodation will require the
granting of a variance, the Applicant shall submit an application to the
Village Zoning Department. The application will be reviewed by the Village
Zoning Inspector.
         C.   The Zoning Department will forward the application for a variance
to the BZA along with the Department's recommendation, which will include the
applicability of the Act.
         D.   The BZA will schedule a hearing, in accordance with Section
1125.02(b). The Applicant will be given at least ten (10) days notice prior to
the date of the hearing.
         E.   A written decision that includes Findings of Fact and Conclusion
of Laws will be given to the Applicant within thirty (30) days after the final
hearing. An appeal of the decision may to Mahoning County Common Pleas Court.
         F.   The Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law will take into
consideration the reasonable accommodation request consistent with the Fair
Housing Amendments Act and 24 C.F.R. §100.204 and with Ohio's laws against
discrimination Ohio R.C. 4112.02 as applicable to "housing providers" engaged
in housing related transactions.
      (2)   Conditional Use.
         A.   A request for a reasonable accommodation may require a
conditional use, which can be granted only by the BZA.
         B.   If a request for a reasonable accommodation will require a
conditional use, the Applicant shall submit an application to the Village
Zoning Department. The application will be reviewed by the Village Zoning
Inspector.
         C.   The Zoning Inspector will forward the application for a
conditional use to the BZA along with the Zoning Inspector's recommendation,
which will include the applicability of the Act.
         D.   The BZA will schedule a hearing, in accordance with Section
1125.02(b). The Applicant will be given at least ten (10) days notice prior to
the date of the hearing.
         E.   A written decision that includes Findings of Fact and Conclusion
of Laws will be given to the Applicant within thirty (30) days after the final
hearing. An appeal of the decision may to Mahoning County Common Pleas Court.
         F.   The Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law will take into
consideration the reasonable accommodation request consistent with the Fair
Housing Amendments Act and 24 C.F.R. §100.204. and with Ohio's laws against
discrimination Ohio R.C. 4112.02 as applicable to "housing providers" engaged
in housing related transactions.
      (3)   Some requests cannot be accommodated by a variance or conditional
use. This may include, for example, request related to zoning violations or
appeals of those violations. Under Ohio law, the BZA may not have explicit
authority to review these requests involving the Resolution requirements. But
you may still be entitled to a reasonable accommodation of these zoning
requirements.
         A.   Submit your request for a reasonable accommodation to the Zoning
Department.
         B.   You will be notified in writing within a reasonable time of the
zoning department's decision.
         C.   A denial of a request for a reasonable accommodation (zoning
violation) may be appealed to the BZA.
      (4)   Accommodations regarding these processes. Due to a disability, some
persons may face difficulties in attending a hearing or taking other actions
that may be normally used in the processes described above. As an example, this
may include, but is not limited to, an individual with a disability that makes
it difficult for them to present personal information and evidence about their
disability in a public forum. In that circumstance, the individual may submit a
request for a reasonable accommodation of these zoning requirements.
         A.   Submit your request for a reasonable accommodation to the Zoning
Department.
         B.   You will be notified in writing within a reasonable time of the
zoning department's decision.
         C.   A denial of a request for a reasonable accommodation (zoning
violation) may be appealed to the BZA.
   
   (b)   If necessary to reach a decision on the request for reasonable
accommodation, the Zoning Department or the BZA may request further information
from the applicant consistent with the Act, specifying in detail what
information is required. Such requests for further information should be done
promptly so as not to delay the processing of the reasonable accommodation
request. The interactive process and verifications are also explained further
below in this policy.
(Ord. 4097. Passed 6-14-23.)
1133.06 FACTORS FOR CONSIDERING REQUESTS FOR REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS.
   The Act does not provide a blanket waiver of all zoning rules for persons
who claim a disability. The BZA and the Zoning Department shall consider the
following criteria when deciding whether a requested accommodation is
reasonable:
   (a)   Is the housing, which is the subject of the request for reasonable
accommodation, to be used by an individual protected under the Act?
   (b)   Is the request for accommodation necessary to make specific housing
available to an individual protected under the Act?
   (c)   Is the zoning requirement unduly burdensome to an individual protected
under the Act?
   (d)   Whether the requested accommodation would impose an undue financial or
administrative burden on the Village?
   (e)   Whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental
alteration in the nature of the Village Zoning Ordinance or undermine the basic
purpose of the zoning requirement?
   (f)   Does the requested accommodation affect the health, safety, and
welfare of a neighboring property or present a direct threat to other
neighboring property owners?
      (Ord. 4097. Passed 6-14-23.)
1133.07 INTERACTIVE PROCESS.
   If, after reviewing the factors described in Section
1133.06, the Zoning Inspector determines that the requested accommodation
should be denied of if the Zoning Inspector recommends that the BZA deny the
request, before the Zoning Inspector issues a written decision or or
recommendation, the Zoning Inspector shall engage in an interactive process
with the requester in which the Zoning Inspector and the requester discuss the
requester's disability related need for the requested accommodation and
possible alternative accommodations to identify an effective accommodation for
the requester that does not pose an undue financial and administrative burden
for the Village, does not require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the
Village's zoning scheme, affect the health, safety, and welfare of a
neighboring property, or undermine the basic purpose of the zoning requirement.
(Ord. 4097. Passed 6-14-23.)
1133.08 VERIFICATION OF DISABILITY.
   (a)   In response to a request for a reasonable accommodation, if the
disability is not obvious, the Village may request reliable disability-related
information that (1) is necessary to verify that the person meets the
definition of disability (i.e., has a physical or mental impairment that
substantially limits one or more major life activities), (2) describes the
needed accommodation, and (3) shows the relationship between the person's
disability and the need for the requested accommodation.
   (b)   Depending on the requester's individual circumstances, information
verifying that the person meets the Act's definition of disability may be
provided by the individual himself or herself (e.g., proof that an individual
under 65 years of age receives Supplemental Security Income or Social Security
Disability Insurance benefits or a credible statement by the individual). The
following may provide verification of a disability:
      (1)   Physician, including Medical Doctor, Podiatrist, Doctor of
Osteopathic Medicine
      (2)   Ophthalmologist and Optometrist
      (3)   Chiropractor
      (4)   Physician's Assistant
      (5)   Psychiatrist and Psychologist
      (6)   Registered Nurse, Advanced Practice Nurse, Nurse Practitioner and
Nurse Anesthetist
      (7)   Physical Therapist and Occupational Therapist
      (8)   Audiologist
      (9)   Speech Pathologist
      (10)   Licensed Counselor, Social Worker or Therapist
   In most cases, an individual's medical records or detailed information about
the nature of a person's disability is not necessary for this inquiry.

date, and as identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC).
1301.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.

deemed to nullify any provisions of state or federal law. The Municipality may
make further and additional regulations, not in conflict with Ohio R.C.
Chapters 3781 and 3791 or with the rules of the Board of Building Standards.
However approval by the Board of Building Standards of any fixture, device,
material, system, assembly or product of a manufacturing process, or method or
manner of construction or installation shall constitute approval for their use
anywhere in Ohio.
   (c)   Other Rules. As provided in division (B) of Ohio R.C. 3781.11, the
rules of the Board of Building Standards shall supersede and govern any order,
standard or rule of the Divisions of State Fire Marshal or Industrial
Compliance in the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Health and of
counties and townships, in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are
in conflict with the rules of the Board of Building Standards, except that
rules adopted and orders issued by the Fire Marshal pursuant to Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3743 prevail in the event of a conflict.

by other licensing agencies such as the Ohio State Fire Marshal, Ohio
Department of Health, the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services, Ohio
Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, Ohio Department of
Developmental Disabilities, federal agencies, or other licensing authorities.
Owners and designers should investigate these additional licensing agency
requirements to ensure they are incorporated into the building design before
submitting to the certified building department for plan approval.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3781.10 shall govern any rule or standard adopted by the Board pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 4104.02 and 4105.011.
(OBC 102)
1301.09 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Building Official. The Building Official is responsible for the
enforcement of the rules of the Board and of Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and 3791
relating to the construction, arrangement, and the erection of buildings or
parts thereof. All building officials shall conduct themselves in a
professional, courteous, impartial, responsive, and cooperative manner. The
Building Official shall render interpretations of this Code and to adopt
policies and procedures in order to clarify the application of its provisions.
Such interpretations, policies and procedures shall be in compliance with the
intent and purpose of this Code. Building Officials shall be responsible to
assure that a system is in place to track and audit all projects, to assure
that all Building Department personnel perform their duties in accordance with
this section, and for the overall administration of a Building Department as
follows:
   (b)   Applications and Plan Approvals. The Building Official shall receive
applications, require or cause the submitted construction documents to be
examined, ascertain by such examinations whether the construction indicated and
described is in accordance with the requirements of this Ohio Building Code,
and shall issue plan approvals for the construction, erection, alteration,
demolition and moving of buildings and structures. The Building Official shall
require a master plans examiner or elective plans examiners to examine the
construction documents to verify the construction indicated is in accordance
with the requirements of this Code and shall assure coordination of plan
review.
   (c)   Plan Examination by the Building Official. When the Building
Department does not have in its full-time employ a certified master plans
examiner, the certified Building Official shall examine construction documents
to determine compliance with the rules of the Board if the registered design
professional elects to submit construction documents that contain a written
certification by the registered design professional indicating conformance with
the requirements of the rules of the Board and Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and
3791.
   (d)   Orders. The Building Official shall issue all orders in accordance
with Section 1301.06 to ensure compliance with the Ohio Building Code.
   (e)   Inspections.
      (1)   If the plans for the erection, construction, repair, alteration,
relocating, or equipment of a building are subject to inspection by the
Building Official, under Section 108 of the Ohio Building Code, the Building
Official shall cause to be made such inspections, investigations, and
determinations as are necessary to determine whether or not the work which has
been performed and the installations which have been made are in conformity
with the approved construction documents. The Building Official shall identify
any special conditions that would affect the timing of inspections and schedule
inspections times mutually agreed upon by the Building Official and the owner.
      (2)   Special inspections are as required under Section 1704 of the Ohio
Building Code.
   (f)   Department Records. The Building Official shall keep official records
of applications received, certificate of plan approvals issued, notices and
orders issued, certificates of occupancy, certificates of completion and other
such records required by the rules of the Board of Building Standards. Such
information shall be retained in the official permanent record for each
project. One set of approved construction documents shall be retained by the
Building Official for a period of not less than one hundred eighty days from
date of completion of the permitted work, or as required by document retention
regulations.
   (g)   Department Reports. The Building Official shall be responsible for the
submission of reports and any requested special information to the Board of
Building Standards as required in paragraph (F) of Rule 4101: 7-2-01 of the
Administrative Code. Failure to submit these reports as required by rule or by
special request or inquiry of the Board of Building Standards may be grounds
for Board action as described in paragraph (F)(7) of Rule 4101:7-3-01 of the
Administrative Code.
   (h)   Liability. Liability of certified Building Department personnel for
any tortious act will be determined by Ohio courts to the applicable provisions
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 2744.
(OBC 104)
1301.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter or any Code adopted herein or
fails to comply with any lawful order issued pursuant thereto is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be fined not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000) or imprisoned not more than six months or both. Each day
during which noncompliance or a violation continues shall constitute a separate
offense. The Municipality may institute injunction proceedings in Common Pleas
Court to abate the nuisance of failure to cease work after receipt of a stop
work order.

1307.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Village Council of Lowellville, State of
Ohio, does ordain as follows.
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The Village of Lowellville has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Lowellville as identified in subsection (f), including any additional areas of
special flood hazard annexed by the Village of Lowellville.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Mahoning County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Mahoning County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective November 18, 2009.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Lowellville as required by Section
1307.04 (c), Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Village Hall at 140 East Liberty Street Lowellville,
Ohio 44436.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including Subdivision Regulations,
Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Lowellville, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 3600.
Passed 9-16-09.)
1307.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (1)   Accessory Structure. A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (2)   Appeal. A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a

as the one percent (1%) chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (4)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE). The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).

filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   (7)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor. See “Lowest Floor.”
   (8)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management). Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (9)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (10)   Fill. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (11)   Flood or Flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (12)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (13)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (14)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      Zone A:    Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      Zones A1 -30
      and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone AO:   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain);
average depths are determined.
      Zone AH:   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations
are determined.
      Zone A99:   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the
100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing
drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.
      Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   (15)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (16)   Flood Protection Elevation. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (17)   Floodway. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized
by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (18)   Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (19)   Historic structure. Any structure that is:
      A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      C.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      D.   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by Village of Lowellville's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (20)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (21)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data that,
usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations,
floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type
of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel
has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore,
excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and comment
by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum National
Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend
or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (22)   Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (23)   Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (24)   Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (25)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (26)   New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Lowellville
Flood Insurance Rate Map, July 3, 1981, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (27)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C. 111.15
as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited to,
any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
General Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General's Department, or
any court.
   (28)   Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is:
      A.   Built on a single chassis,
      B.   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      C.   Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (29)   Registered Professional Architect. A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (30)   Registered Professional Engineer. A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (31)   Registered Professional Surveyor. A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (32)   Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood-prone and designated from
other federal state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood-prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (33)   Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (34)   Structure. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (35)   Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (36)   Substantial Improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      A.   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction”;
      B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      C.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (37)   Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (38)   Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 3600. Passed 9-16-09.)

ensure that Village of Lowellville flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section
1307.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries.
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section 
1307.04 (c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1) hereof, prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these maps revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations of base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the
Village of Lowellville, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Lowellville have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of Lowellville Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the
Village of Lowellville boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a
map of the Village of Lowellville suitable for reproduction, clearly showing
the new corporate limits or the new area for which the Village of Lowellville
has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway areas exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretations
as provided in Section
1307.05 , Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing that an area of special flood hazard
and field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1307.03 (j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the Village of Lowellville and the

actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1307.04(i)(1)B., items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village of Lowellville specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1307.03 (j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.

1307.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Village of Lowellville Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby
appointed to serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by
Village Code.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board.
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board hall be kept and filed in
Village Hall at 140 East Liberty Street Lowellville, Ohio 44436.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties
in interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is
submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for variance will be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the Village of
Lowellville.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.    The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (5)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A. to K. have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 3600. Passed 9-16-09.)

newspapers, circulars, flyers, mail, past due utility notices, or other means
of notice by publication, the accumulation of junk, litter, trash, or debris,
absence of windows or window treatments, absence of furnishings and personal

the building or floor not in use to the occupied space; the condition and value
of any items in the structure and the presence of rental or for sale signs on
the property.

claim of a named insured for fire damage to a structure located within the
Village where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under
all policies exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000) unless there is compliance
with the following procedures:
   (a)   (1)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds
and the company or companies equals or exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the
aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or
structure, the insurance company or companies in accordance with Ohio R.C.
715.26(F) shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Fire Chief in the
aggregate two thousand dollars ($2,000) for each twenty thousand dollars

proof of loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the insurance
company or companies, the named insured or insureds have submitted a
contractor’s signed estimate of the cost of removing or repairing the building
or other structure, shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the amount
specified in the estimate. Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata
basis by all companies insuring the building or other structure. Policy
proceeds remaining after the transfer to the Village shall be disbursed in
accordance with the policy terms.
      (2)   The named insured or insureds may submit a contractor’s signed
estimate of the cost of removing or repairing the building or other structure

structure.
   (b)   (1)   Upon receipt of proceeds by the Village as authorized by this

Village with the name and address of the named insured or insureds, whereupon

procedures will be followed:
      (2)   The fund shall be returned to the named insured or insureds when
repair or removal of the building or other structure has been completed and the
required proof received by the designated officer, if the Village has not
incurred any costs for such repair, removal or securing of the building or
other structure, such costs shall be paid from the fund and if excess funds
remain, the Village shall transfer the remaining funds to the named insured or
insureds. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of
the Village to recover any deficiency under Ohio R.C. 715.261.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Village and the

out the duties of this section. The Fire Chief shall file a certified copy of
this section with the Superintendent of Insurance of the State.
