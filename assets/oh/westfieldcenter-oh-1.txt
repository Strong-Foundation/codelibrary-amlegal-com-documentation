ADOPTING ORDINANCE
VILLAGE OF WESTFIELD CENTER, OHIO
ORDINANCE NO. 1996-14
   AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND ENACT THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES OF
WESTFIELD CENTER, OHIO 1996; TO REPEAL ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS IN CONFLICT
THEREWITH; AND TO PUBLISH THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER.
   WHEREAS, Council has had the matter of codification and general revision of
the legislation of the Village before it for some time; and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with The Justinian
Publishing Company to prepare and publish such codification; and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such legislation, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed, is now
before the Council;
   NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the Village of Westfield
Center, Ohio, that:
   SECTION 1. The ordinances and resolutions of the Village of Westfield
Center, Ohio, of a general and permanent nature, as revised, codified, arranged
and consolidated into component codes, titles, chapters and sections, are
hereby approved, adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Westfield
Center, Ohio, 1996.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk-Treasurer, attached to this ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of the Village of
Westfield Center, Ohio.
   SECTION 2. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof which are in
conflict or inconsistent with any provision of the Codified Ordinances are
hereby repealed as of the effective date of this ordinance, except as follows:
      (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.
      (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
           (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement
or privilege;
           (2)   The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property;
           (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or
guarantee of payment;
           (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation;
           (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness;
           (6)   The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges;
           (7)   The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any
street or public way;
           (8)   The dedication of property or plat approval;
           (9)   The annexation or detachment of territory;
           (10)   Any legislation enacted subsequent to April 1, 1996.
   SECTION 3. Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.23, the Clerk-Treasurer shall publish,
in a manner required by law, a notice of the enactment of this ordinance,
containing the title of this ordinance, together with a summary of the new
matter contained in the Codified Ordinances hereby adopted, a copy of which
summary is attached hereto.
   SECTION 4. All sections and subsections in the Codified Ordinances of
Westfield Center without an ordinance or resolution history, or with the words
"Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof, are or contain new matter in the
Codified Ordinances, said new matter having been found to be necessary, in the
course of preparing the Codified Ordinances, to render the legislation of the
Village internally consistent and consistent with State law, where and as
required by Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution, as well as to
adopt the latest editions of technical codes adopted by the Village by
reference, and said new matter is hereby approved, adopted and enacted. A
summary of such new matter is attached to this ordinance as Exhibit A and the
same shall be published, together with notice of the adoption of this
ordinance, as aforesaid, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.23.
   SECTION 5. Because some of the new matter approved, adopted and enacted by
Section 4 of this ordinance is in the Planning and Zoning Code of the Codified
Ordinances (Part Twelve of the Codified Ordinances), a public hearing shall be
scheduled for this ordinance, prior to final adoption thereof, pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 711.101 and 713.12.
   SECTION 6. Subject to the provisions of Section 5 of this ordinance, this
ordinance, and the Codified Ordinances hereby approved, adopted and enacted,
shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage by a vote of at
least a majority of all the members of Council.
Passed: July 2, 1996

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a State legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature, through inaction, has elected
to observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.

   The risk to the Village of Westfield Center (Village), its employees and

Village and can be reduced through the efforts of every Village employee and
contractor.
(Res. 2012-02. Passed 2-7-12.)
210.02 PURPOSE.
   The Village adopts this sensitive information policy to help protect
employees, customers, contractors and the Village from damages related to the

   (a)   This policy will:
      (1)   Define sensitive information;
      (2)   Describe the physical security of data when it is printed on paper;

distributed; and
      (4)   Place the Village in compliance with State and Federal law
regarding identify theft protection.
   (b)   This policy enables the Village to protect existing customers,
reducing risk from identify fraud, and minimize potential damage to the Village
from fraudulent new accounts. The program will help the Village:
      (1)   Identify risks that signify potentially fraudulent activity within
new or existing covered accounts;
      (2)   Detect risks when they occur in covered accounts;
      (3)   Respond to risks to determine if fraudulent activity has occurred
and act if fraud has been attempted or committed; and
      (4)   Update the program periodically, including reviewing the accounts
that are covered and the identified risks that are part of the program.
(Res. 2012-02. Passed 2-7-12.)
210.03 SCOPE.
   This policy and protection program applies to employees, contractors,
consultants, temporary workers, and other workers at the Village, including all

(Res. 2012-02. Passed 2-7-12.)

            2.   Insurance claims;
            3.   Prescriptions;

         F.   Other personal information belonging to any customer, employee or
contractor, examples of which include:
            1.   Date of birth;
            2.   Address;
            3.   Phone numbers;
            4.   Maiden name;
            5.   Names;
            6.   Customer number.
         G.   Village personnel are encouraged to use common sense judgment in
securing confidential information to the proper extent. Furthermore, this

Village's open records policy. If an employee is uncertain of the sensitivity
of a particular piece of information, he or she should contact their
supervisor.
   (b)   Hard Copy Distribution. Each employee and contractor performing work
for the Village will comply with the following policies:
      (1)   File cabinets, desk drawers, overhead cabinets, and any other

common shared work areas will be cleared of all documents containing sensitive
information when not in use.
      (4)   White boards, dry-erase boards, writing tablets, etc. in common

Village's records retention policy.
   (c)   Electronic Distribution. Each employee and contractor performing work

      (1)   Internally, sensitive information may be transmitted using approved
Village e-mail. All sensitive information must be encrypted when stored in an
electronic format.
      (2)   Any sensitive information sent externally must be encrypted and
password protected and only to approved recipients. Additionally, a statement
such as this should be included in the e-mail:
"This message may contain confidential and/or proprietary information and is
intended for the person/entity to whom it was originally addressed. Any use by
others is strictly prohibited."
(Res. 2012-02. Passed 2-7-12.)
210.05 CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS.
   (a)   Covered Accounts. A “covered account” includes any account that
involves or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions. Every new
and existing customer account that meets the following criteria is covered by
this program:
      (1)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft; or
      (2)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk to the safety or soundness of the Village from
identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputations, or
litigation risks.
   (b)   Red Flags.
      (1)   The following red flags are potential indicators of fraud. Any time
a red flag, or a situation closely resembling a red flag, is apparent, it
should be investigated for verification.
         A.   Alerts, notifications or warnings from a consumer reporting
agency;
         B.   A fraud or active duty alert included with a consumer report;
         C.   A notice of credit freeze from a consumer reporting agency in
response to a request for a consumer report; or
         D.   A notice of address discrepancy from a consumer reporting agency
as defined in § 334.82(b) of the Fairness and Accuracy in Credit Transactions
Act.
      (2)   Red flags also include consumer reports that indicate a pattern of
activity inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an
applicant or customer, such as:
         A.   A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
         B.   An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;
         C.   A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect
to recently established credit relationships; or
         D.   An account that was closed for cause or identified to abuse of
account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
   (c)   Suspicious Documents.
      (1)   Documents provided for identification that appear to have been
altered or forged.
      (2)   The photograph or physical description on the identification is not
consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
identification.
      (3)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification.
      (4)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the Village, such as a
signature card or a recent check.
      (5)   An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the
appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
   (d)   Suspicious Personal Identifying Information.
      (1)   Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the Village. For example:
         A.   The address does not match any address in the consumer report;
         B.   The Social Security number (SSN) has not been issued or is listed
on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File; or
         C.   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not
consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and
date of birth.
      (2)   Personal identifying information provided is associated with known
fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third party sources used by the
Village. For example, the address on an application is the same as the address
provided on a fraudulent application.
      (3)   Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly
associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third party
sources used by the Village. For example:
         A.   The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a
prison; or
         B.   The phone number is invalid or is associated with a pager or
answering service.
      (4)   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons
opening an account or other customers.
      (5)   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar
to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of
other customers or other persons opening accounts.
      (6)   The customer or the person opening the covered account fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete.
      (7)   Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal identifying information that is on file with the Village.
      (8)   When using security questions (mother's maiden name, pet's name,
etc.), the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide
authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from
a wallet or consumer report.
   (e)   Unusual Use of, or Suspicious Activity Related to, the Covered
Account.
      (1)   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered
account, the Village receives a request for new, additional, or replacement
goods or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the account.
      (2)   A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly
associated with known patterns of fraud. For example, the customer fails to
make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments.
      (3)   A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with
established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:
         A.   Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments;
         B.   A material change in purchasing or usage patterns.
      (4)   A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy
period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the
expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).
      (5)   Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable
although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the
customer's covered account.
      (6)   The Village is notified that the customer is not receiving paper
account statements.
      (7)   The Village is notified of unauthorized charges or transactions in
connection with a customer's covered account.
      (8)   The Village receives notice from customers, victims of identify
theft, law enforcement authorities, or other persons regarding possible
identify theft in connection with covered accounts held by the Village.
      (9)   The Village is notified by a customer, a victim of identify theft,
a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a
fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.
(Res. 2012-02. Passed 2-7-12.)
210.06 RESPONDING TO RED FLAGS.
   (a)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, an employee must act
quickly, as a rapid appropriate response can protect customers and the Village
from damages and loss.
      (1)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, gather all
related documentation and write a description of the situation. Present this
information to the designated authority for determination.
      (2)   The designated authority will complete additional authentication to
determine whether the attempted transaction was fraudulent or authentic.
   (b)   If a transaction is determined to be fraudulent, appropriate actions
must be taken immediately. Actions may include:
      (1)   Canceling the transaction;
      (2)   Notifying and cooperating with appropriate law enforcement;
      (3)   Determining the extent of liability of the Village; and
      (4)   Notifying the actual customer that fraud has been attempted.
(Res. 2012-02. Passed 2-7-12.)
210.07 PERIODIC UPDATES TO PLAN.
   (a)   At periodic intervals, or as required, the program will be re-
evaluated to determine whether all aspects of the program are up to date and
applicable in the current business environment.
   (b)   Periodic reviews will include an assessment of which accounts are
covered by the program.
   (c)   As part of the review, red flags may be revised, replaced or
eliminated. Defining new red flags may also be appropriate.
   (d)   Actions to take in the event that fraudulent activity is discovered
may also require revision to reduce damage to the Village and its customers.
(Res. 2012-02. Passed 2-7-12.)
210.08 PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Involvement of Management.
      (1)   The Identify Theft Prevention Program shall be operated as an
extension to existing fraud prevention programs, and its importance warrants
the highest level of attention.
      (2)   The Identity theft Prevention Program is the responsibility of the
Council. Approval of the initial plan must be appropriately documented and
maintained.
      (3)   Operational responsibility of the program is delegated to the
Fiscal Officer.
   (b)   Staff Training.
      (1)   Staff training will be conducted for all employees, officials and
contractors for whom it is reasonably foreseeable that they may come into
contact with accounts or personally identifiable information that may
constitute a risk to the Village or its customers.
      (2)   The Fiscal Officer is responsible for ensuring identity theft
training for all requisite employees and contractors.
      (3)   Employees must receive annual training in all elements of this
policy.
      (4)   To ensure maximum effectiveness, employees may continue to receive
additional training as changes to the program are made.
   (c)   Oversight of Service Provider Arrangements.
      (1)   It is the responsibility of the Village to ensure that the
activities of all service providers are conducted in accordance with reasonable
policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent and mitigate the risk of
identity theft.
      (2)   A service provider that maintains its own identity theft prevention
program, consistent with the guidance of the red flag rules and validated by
appropriate due diligence, may be considered to be meeting these requirements.
      (3)   Any specific requirements should be specifically addressed in the
appropriate contract arrangements.
(Res. 2012-02. Passed 2-7-12.)

282.01 PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY.
   It is the policy of Westfield Center Village that openness leads to a better
informed citizenry, which leads to better government and better public policy.
It is the responsibility of the police to strictly adhere to the State's Public
Records Act. All exemptions to openness are to be construed in their narrowest
sense and any denial of public records in response to a valid request must be
accompanied by an explanation, including legal authority, as outlined in the
Ohio Revised Code. If the request is in writing, the explanation must also be
in writing.
   (a)   Public Records.
      (1)   This office, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, defines
“records” as including the following: Any document, paper, electronic
(including, but not limited to, e-mail), or other format, that is created or
received by, or comes under the jurisdiction of a public office that documents
the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or
other activities of the office. All records of the Village are public unless
they are specifically exempt from disclosure under the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   It is the policy of the Village that, as required by Ohio law,
records will be organized and maintained so that they are readily available for
inspection and copying (See division (d) of this section for the e-mail record
policy). Record retention schedules are to be updated regularly and posted
prominently.
   (b)   Record Requests. Each request for public records should be evaluated
for a response using the following guidelines:
      (1)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian must contact
the requester for clarification, and should assist the requestor in revising
the request by informing the requestor of the manner in which the office keeps
its records.
      (2)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing,
and does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record. It is this office's general policy that this
information is not to be requested.
      (3)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours, with the exception of published holidays. Public records must
be made available for inspection promptly. Copies of public records must be
made available within a reasonable period of time. “Prompt” and “reasonable”
take into account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the
location where the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review
of the records requested.
      (4)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately, if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), budgets, salary
information, forms and applications, personnel rosters, etc. If fewer than 20
pages of copies are requested or if the records are readily available in an
electronic format that can be e-mailed or downloaded easily, these should be
made a quickly as the equipment allows. All requests for public records must
either be satisfied as set forth in this division, or be acknowledged in
writing by the Village within three business days following the office's
receipt of the request. If a request is deemed significantly beyond “routine”,
such acknowledgment must include the following:
         A.   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request.
         B.   An estimated cost if copies are requested.
         C.   Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure.
      (5)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority. If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released. If there
are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation,
including legal authority.
   (c)   Costs for Public Records. Those seeking public records will be charged
only the actual cost of making copies.
      (1)   The charge for paper copies is five cents ($0.05) per page
      (2)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is one
dollar ($1.00) per disc.
      (3)   There is no charge for documents e-mailed.
      (4)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. They will be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies.
   (d)   E-mail. Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by
the Ohio Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the office.
E-mail is to be treated in the same fashion as records in other formats and
should follow the same retention schedules.

TITLE TEN - JUDICIARY
   Chap.
290.   Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 290
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Westfield Center
has jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a
Westfield Center ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes
involving moving traffic violations occurring on State highways located within
the corporate limits of Westfield Center, subject to the limitations of Ohio R
.C. 2937.08 and 2938.04. In keeping his or her docket and file, the Mayor shall
be governed by the laws pertaining to county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
the Mayor unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him or her, waives a
jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such
event, does not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then the magistrate
shall require the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court
of record in Medina County (the Wadsworth Municipal Court) and the magistrate
shall thereupon certify all papers filed, together with a transcript of
proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such recognizance, if given, to the
court of record. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure
provides that in petty offense cases, where there is a right to jury trial, the
defendant shall be tried by the court unless he or she demands a jury trial.
The jurisdiction of a Mayor's Court, in such cases, is further limited by Rule
9 of the Ohio Traffic Rules, which provides that if a jury demand is not made
pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant waives his or her right to jury
trial in writing, a mayor may try the case only if (1) his or her compensation
as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case convictions, or (2) he
or she is not the chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall
be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the
clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for
trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for
trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04
provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of record,
but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Village ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated "Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas," the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.
   Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor's Courts were authorized to
suspend the operator's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section
434.01 of the Traffic Code (O.V.I.), in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4507.16(B).

while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the offender may enter
a written plea of guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the

         B.   1.   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is
convicted of the violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties
provided by law, may impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may
impose the additional fine of not more than $100.
            2.   If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty
for the violation and an additional fine of not more than $100, the court shall
inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine of not more
than $100, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted driving
safety course described in division (b)(2)A. of this section. If the offender
elects the course option and attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of not more than $100, so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under division (b) of this section.
      (3)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation,
or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in
division (b)(2) of this section that indicates that the offender was distracted
while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the officer shall do
both of the following:
         A.   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;

violation of any provision of this Traffic Code that is substantially similar
to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or required to
suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit for a
violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other penalties
authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for the period of time the
court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for the
violation of the provision of this Traffic Code shall not exceed the period of
suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of the
provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this Traffic Code is
substantially similar.

414.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop immediately before a clearly marked
stop line; but if there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk,
then before entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal
indication to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)
(2), and (c)(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street, after stopping. The right to proceed with the
turn shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop immediately before a
clearly marked stop line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at
the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of
approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the
intersection. The right to proceed shall be subject to the provisions that are
applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

414.05 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"don't walk," or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall

if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with R.C. § 4511.98,
the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall impose
upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the violation
under division (d)(1)A., (d)(1)B., or (d)(1)C. of this section, as applicable.
      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom division
(d)(1)A. of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of $150 under
division (d)(1)A. of this section and the assessment of points under division
(d)(4) of this section, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted

and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall not be required to pay the fine and shall not have the points assessed
against that offender’s driver’s license if the offender submits the written
evidence to the court within 90 days of the violation of division (a) of this
section. However, successful completion of the course does not result in a
dismissal of the charges for the violation, and the violation is a prior
offense under divisions (d)(1)B. and (d)(1)C. of this section if the offender
commits a subsequent violation or violations of division (a) of this section

be assessed for a violation of division (a) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for purposes of enforcing this section
unless the officer visually observes the operator using, holding, or physically
supporting with any part of the person’s body the electronic wireless
communications device.

device;
         B.   Confiscate the device while awaiting the issuance of a warrant to
access the device;
         C.   Obtain consent from the operator to access the device through
coercion or any other improper means. Any consent by the operator to access the
device shall be voluntary and unequivocal before the officer may access the
device without a warrant.

   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
this section does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 for the same conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of this
section and is also adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic

   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in R.C. §
2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period
of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under R.C. § 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a
blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to R.C. § 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director of a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst's or test performer's
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definitions. As used in this section:
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device” means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 5119.01.

      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, oral
fluid, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine if arrested
for a violation of division (a), (b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A)
or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance or any other
municipal O.V.I. ordinance.
      (3)    The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in

officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if convicted would
be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)
(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine for the purpose of
determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine. A law enforcement officer who
makes a request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical
test or tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required
to give the person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but
the officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the
person refuses to take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever
reasonable means are necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical
test of the person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall
also advise the person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an
independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3)
and (g)(4) of this section apply to the administration of a chemical test or
tests pursuant to this division.

made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance

substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, the arresting
officer shall read the following form to the person:
   "You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I. or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state O.V.I., and,
if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
   (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense."
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person's initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:

required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the 60-day period following the date of sentencing, the court may
impose an alternative sentence as specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(3) that

required by division (d) of this section, or for the sole purpose of issuing a
ticket, citation or summons if that requirement has been or is being violated,
or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of that requirement.
   (g)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.

forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

indirect criminal contempt under R.C. § 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the
underlying case.
         B.   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)

(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree, and the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, then in addition to any other penalties
provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to R.C. § 2929.28 in
an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic loss arising from an accident
or collision that was the direct and proximate result of the offender’s
operation of the vehicle before, during, or after committing the offense for
which the offender is sentenced under this section.

   (c)   Repeat Traffic Offender; Point System Suspension. Any person whose
driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privileges are suspended as a repeat traffic offender under R.C. § 4510.037 and
who, during the suspension, operates any motor vehicle upon any public roads
and highways is guilty of driving under a twelve-point suspension, a

minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the first three days
of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.
(R.C. § 4510.037(J))
   d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public

or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver's
or commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this State or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to §

to one thousand dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding §
698.02(e)(1)C. and Ohio R.C. 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered
pursuant to §
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up
to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community
service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under R.C. § 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of
this section or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under division (c)(2) of this section, if
within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender's license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender's
driver license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(7).

      (3)   If, within six years of the offense, the offender previously has

assigned or transferred and Ohio R.C. 4503.234(B)(2) or (3) applies, the court
may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of
the National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds from any fine so

with electronic monitoring under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on
the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that

section, the privileges shall be granted on the additional condition that the
offender must display restricted license plates, issued under Ohio R.C.
4503.231, on the vehicle driven subject to the privileges, except as provided
in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).
      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver's license under this section
shall be concurrent with any period of suspension or disqualification under
Ohio R.C. 3123.58 or 4506.16. No person who is disqualified for life from
holding a commercial driver's license under Ohio R.C. 4506.16 shall be issued a
driver's license under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period for which the
commercial driver's license was suspended under this section, and no person

purpose of determining whether the violation has been or is being committed.
   (e)   Use of Fines for Educational Program. All fines collected for
violations of division (b) of this section shall be forwarded to the State
Treasurer for deposit in the funds as set forth in Ohio R.C. 4513.263(E).
   (f)   Limitations on Evidence Used for Prosecution.
      (1)   Subject to division (f)(2) of this section, the failure of a person
to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of division (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section or
the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates division (b)(2) of this section shall be subject
to the penalty set forth in Section
408.02.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
division (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates division (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

of improper replacement of a motor vehicle air bag, a misdemeanor of the first
degree on a first offense. On each subsequent offense, or if the violation
results in serious physical harm to an individual, the person is guilty of a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.

440.01 LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         B.   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
      (4)   The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the Municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)
   (c)   Local Streets. No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity
with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37, or exceeding a gross weight of five
tons, upon any street in the Municipality other than state routes and County
roads, except those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as
such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is necessary
to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of such
vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage
through the Municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a
state route or a designated truck route within the Municipality shall confine
such deviation to that required in order to accomplish the purpose of the
departure. On County roads, Council or other duly designated local authority
shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the construction and
material specifications for such roads and the load resistance of such roads as
determined by the County Engineer. County roads shall be posted with signs
indicating such weight limits.
   (d)   Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Street Commissioner may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move
an oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (1)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Street Commissioner may grant a permit for a single or round
trip, or for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Street
Commissioner in his or her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of
any construction project. The Street Commissioner may limit or prescribe terms
or conditions of operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by
designating the route, hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be
necessary for the preservation of the public peace, property, health and
safety. The Street Commissioner may require the posting of bond or other
security necessary to compensate for any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Street Commissioner shall charge twenty-
five dollars ($25.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by
the Police Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the
applicant shall pay the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00).
      (4)   Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating “no thru trucks -
gross weight 5 tons” or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Street Commissioner shall be cause for immediate
revocation or suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future
permit. Such violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties
prescribed by Sections
408.01 and
408.02.
   (e)   Gross Weight Defined. As used in this section, "gross weight" means
the weight of a vehicle plus the weight of any load thereon.
   (f)   Authority of Police Officers to Weigh Vehicles. Any police officer,
having reason to believe that the weight of a vehicle and load is unlawful, is
authorized to require the driver to stop and submit to the weighing of the same
either by means of a portable or stationary scale, and may require that the
vehicle be driven to the nearest scale.

452.05 WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   Impounding Abandoned Motor Vehicle on Public Property; Notice;
Disposition. The Police Chief, upon notification to the Police Chief of such
action and of the location of the place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. §
4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the Police chief as a result of the
performance of the Police Chief’s duties; or

time, the Police Chief shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the Police Chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the Police Chief issues an order under division (a) of this section
and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle by a towing service, the towing
service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated by the
Police Chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed.
   (c)   (1)   The Police Chief shall cause a search to be made of the records
of an applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the
identity of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into
storage by the Police Chief within five business days of the removal of the
vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the Police Chief shall send or cause to
be sent to the owner and any lienholder at the owner’s and any lienholder’s
last known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested,
by certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner and any lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the

registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon presentation of
proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of the motor vehicle
also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without retrieving the
vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Police Chief to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Police Chief, without charge
to any party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the
place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the
requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk,
without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances, to the Police Chief. If the vehicle is to be
disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in
R.C. § 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Police
Chief shall execute in triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar
of Motor Vehicles, describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was
disposed of, and that all requirements of this section have been complied with.
The Police Chief shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Police
Chief’s records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage
dealer or other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the
motor vehicle salvage dealer, the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (b)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (b) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.

fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor

the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

recovered by the owner or lienholder or at least two years after the date on
which the vehicle was towed, whichever is earlier.
         B   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under division (h)
(2) of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more
than two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone,
unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two
hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is
not within the power of the towing service.
      (5)   A.   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under division
(h)(2) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of removing the
vehicle, shall provide notice to the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation concerning all of the following:

the vehicle is titled. The entity that provides the record of the owner and any
lienholder under this division shall ensure that such information is provided
in a timely manner.

      (2)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3)
of this section has expired, prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2913.49
shall be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense either by
an aggrieved person or the aggrieved person’s legal representative who is not a
party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)

      (2)   As used in this division:
         A.   The phrase “offense is directly related to the misconduct in
office of a public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of
Ohio R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A),
2921.43(A) or (B), or 3517.13(F) or (G), that is directly related to an offense
involving misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any
municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code
sections listed in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.
   (d)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03
is determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and
if the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation

to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time
of the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,

within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed or five years
after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused departed this

evidence of the accused’s purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (i)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
   (l)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section that
took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03
committed on and after July 16, 2015, and apply to a violation of either of
those sections committed prior to July 16, 2015, if prosecution for that
violation was not barred under this section as it existed on July 16, 2015.
      (2)   The amendment to division (a)(2) of this section that took effect
on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of R.C. § 2903.01 or R.C. § 2903.02 if the
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4, 2023, and
applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.
(RC 2901.13)
606.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in Ohio R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.” Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.” Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.” Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.” A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
606.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
606.11 ATTEMPTS.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an
attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to
hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
State law. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.
   (f)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Drug abuse offense" has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
      (2)   "Motor vehicle" has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4501.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
606.12 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
606.13 SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (a)   As used in this section, “residence” has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (b)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (c)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.

jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of

or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an

designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, R.C. § 955.11(D)
and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and the
owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog, and §
618.17 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and
“vicious dog” have the same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.

is not a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the court may order the
offender to personally supervise the dog that the offender owns, keeps, or
harbors, to cause that dog to complete dog obedience training, or to do both.

involving the same dog. Upon a person being convicted of or pleading guilty to
a third violation of division (d) of this section involving the same dog, the
court shall require the offender to register the involved dog as a dangerous
dog.
         B.   In addition to the penalties prescribed in division (l)(2)A. of
this section, if a violation of division (d) of this section involves a
nuisance dog, the court may order the offender to personally supervise the
nuisance dog that the offender owns, keeps, or harbors, to cause that dog to
complete dog obedience training, or to do both.
(R.C. § 955.99(F))

training, or to do both, and the court may order the offender to obtain
liability insurance pursuant to division (f) of this section. The court, in the
alternative, may order the dangerous dog to be humanely destroyed by a licensed
veterinarian, the county dog warden, or the county humane society at the
owner’s expense. With respect to a violation of division (d) of this section
that involves a dangerous dog, until the court makes a final determination and

discretion of the dog warden, the dog shall be confined or restrained in
accordance with division (e) of this section or at the county dog pound at the
owner’s expense.

            2.   A misdemeanor of the first degree if the dog causes serious
injury to a person. Additionally, the court may order the vicious dog to be
humanely destroyed by a licensed veterinarian, the county dog warden, or the
county humane society at the owner’s expense.
         B.   If the court does not order the vicious dog to be destroyed under
division (l)(5)A.2. of this section, the court shall issue an order that
specifies that R.C. § 955.11(D) and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply
with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the
dog were a dangerous dog and that §
618.17 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog. As part
of the order, the court shall order the offender to obtain the liability
insurance required under division (f)(1) of this section in an amount,
exclusive of interest and costs, that equals or exceeds $100,000. Until the
court makes a final determination and during the pendency of any appeal of a
violation of division (d) of this section and at the discretion of the dog
warden, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions described in division (e) of this section or at the county dog pound
at the owner’s expense.

county humane society. Until the court makes a final determination and during
the pendency of any appeal of a violation of division (g)(1), (g)(2), or (g)(3)
of this section and at the discretion of the dog warden, the dog shall be
confined or restrained in accordance with the provisions of division (e) of
this section or at the county dog pound at the owner’s expense.
(R.C. § 955.99(L))
      (8)   Whoever violates division (f)(1), (f)(3), or (f)(4) of this section
is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 955.99(M))
      (9)   Whoever violates division (j)(4) of this section is guilty of a
minor misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 955.99(N))
      (10)   A.   If a dog is confined at the county dog pound pursuant to
division (l)(4), (l)(5), or (l)(7) of this section, the county dog warden shall
give written notice of the confinement to the owner of the dog. If the county
dog warden is unable to give the notice to the owner of the dog, the county dog
warden shall post the notice on the door of the residence of the owner of the
dog or in another conspicuous place on the premises at which the dog was
seized. The notice shall include a statement that a security in the amount of
$100 is due to the county dog warden within ten days to secure payment of all
reasonable expenses, including medical care and boarding of the dog for 60
days, expected to be incurred by the county dog pound in caring for the dog
pending the determination. The county dog warden may draw from the security any
actual costs incurred in caring for the dog.
         B.   If the person ordered to post security under division (l)(10)A.
of this section does not do so within ten days of the confinement of the
animal, the dog is forfeited, and the county dog warden may determine the
disposition of the dog unless the court issues an order that specifies

determination under division (l)(4), (l)(5), or (l)(7) of this section, the
county dog warden shall provide the owner of the dog with the actual cost of
the confinement of the dog. If the county dog warden finds that the security
provided under division (l)(10)A. of this section is less than the actual cost
of confinement of the dog, the owner shall remit the difference between the
security provided and the actual cost to the county dog warden within 30 days
after the court’s determination. If the county dog warden finds that the
security provided under division (l)(10)A. of this section is greater than that
actual cost, the county dog warden shall remit the difference between the

enforcement agency, or a laboratory established by or under the authority of an
institution of higher education that has its main campus in this State and that
is accredited by the Association of American Universities or the North Central
Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, primarily for the purpose of
providing scientific service to law enforcement agencies, and signed by the
person performing the analysis, stating that the substance that is the basis of
the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as
to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it contains any
amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of unit
dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or the
existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,
or substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report
from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as
described in this division that is signed by the person performing the
analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the alleged offense
have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content,
weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the
content, identity, and weight of the substances.
      (2)   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by
the signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that the
signer is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report and that performing
the analysis is a part of the signer’s regular duties, and giving an outline of
the signer’s education, training, and experience for performing an analysis of
materials included under this section. The signer shall attest that
scientifically accepted tests were performed with due caution, and that the
evidence was handled in accordance with established and accepted procedures
while in the custody of the laboratory.
   (b)   The prosecuting attorney shall serve a copy of the report on the
attorney of record for the accused, or on the accused if the accused has no
attorney, prior to any proceeding in which the report is to be used against the
accused other than at a preliminary hearing or grand jury proceeding where the
report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (c)   The report shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents,
identity, and weight or the existence and number of unit dosages of the
substance if the accused or the accused’s attorney demands the testimony of the
person signing the report, by serving the demand upon the prosecuting attorney,
within seven days from the accused or the accused’s attorney’s receipt of the
report. The time may be extended by a trial judge in the interests of justice.

substances that are, the basis of the alleged violation preserved for the
benefit of independent analysis performed by a laboratory analyst employed by
the accused person, or, if the accused is indigent, by a qualified laboratory
analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused’s analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s analyst with the sample
portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial. If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused’s analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused’s attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis
and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings, or
opinions concerning the identity of the substance or substances subject to the
analysis.
   (f)   In addition to the rights provided under division (e) of this section,
any person who is accused of a violation of this chapter or Ohio R.C. Chapters
2925 or 3719 that involves a bulk amount of a controlled substance, or any
multiple thereof, or who is accused of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, other than a minor misdemeanor
violation, that involves marihuana, is entitled, upon written request made to
the prosecuting attorney, to have a laboratory analyst of the accused’s choice,
or, if the accused is indigent, a qualified laboratory analyst appointed by the
court, present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis
of the alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

pay to the state, municipal, or county law enforcement agencies that handled
the investigation and prosecution all of the costs that the state, municipal
corporation, or county reasonably incurred in having tests performed under this
section or Ohio R.C. 2925.51 or in any other manner on any substance that was
the basis of, or involved in, the offense to determine whether the substance
contained any amount of a controlled substance if the results of the tests
indicate that the substance tested contained any controlled substance. No court
shall order an offender under this section to pay the costs of tests performed
on a substance if the results of the tests do not indicate that the substance
tested contained any controlled substance. The court shall hold a hearing to
determine the amount of costs to be imposed under this section. The court may

sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than the day or time specified
on its license, the charitable organization may apply in writing to the
Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to R.C. § 2915.08(J). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than

vehicle which is inoperable due to factors such as, but not limited to, missing
parts, damage, non-roadworthy conditions and safety issues, and lack of current
registrations, that is left in the open on private property for more than 72
hours with the permission of the person having the right to possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under the authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 through
4737.12, or otherwise regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the
property on which the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or
regulation by any governmental authority, unless the person having the right to
the possession of the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of
a bona fide commercial operation; or if the motor vehicle is a collector’s
vehicle, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F).
   (b)   No person shall be prevented from storing or keeping, or restricted in
the method of storing or keeping, any collector’s vehicle on private property
with the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except that a person having such permission may be required to
conceal, by means of buildings, fences, vegetation, terrain, or other suitable
obstruction, any unlicensed collector’s vehicle stored in the open.
   (c)   The Police Chief, the Legislative Authority, or the zoning authority
may send notice, by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person
having the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor
vehicle is left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor
vehicle either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable
structure, or shall be removed from the property.
   (d)   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the
open for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this
section. The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima facie evidence
of willful failure to comply with the notice, and each subsequent period of 30
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
(ORC 4513.65)
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a
first offense; on a second offense, such person is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the fourth degree; on each subsequent offense, such person is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree. The penalty shall be as provided in Section
698.02.

672.03 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially similar municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02,
2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses,
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, “fair
market value” is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

   (c)   A motor vehicle identification license plate as prescribed by R.C. §
4503.22, a temporary motor vehicle license registration as prescribed by R.C. §
4503.182, or any comparable temporary motor vehicle license registration as
prescribed by the applicable law of another state or the United States;

property as provided in division (c) of this section, the rentee neither
returned the rented property nor made arrangements acceptable with the renter
to return the rented property.
   (c)   To establish that a rentee has an intent to commit theft of rented
property or rental services under division (b)(2) above, a renter may issue a
notice to a rentee demanding the return of the rented property. The renter
shall mail the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
rentee at the address the rentee gave when the rental contract was executed, or
to the rentee at the last address the rentee or the rentee’s agent furnished in
writing to the renter.
   (d)   A demand for the return of the rented property is not a prerequisite
for the prosecution of a rentee for theft of rented property or rental
services. The evidence specified in division (b) above does not constitute the
only evidence that may be considered as evidence of intent to commit theft of
rented property or rental services.

698.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Dangerous offender” means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   “Repeat offender” means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or
more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses, as

abuse offense;
      (5)   Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or
degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offenses, or minor
misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
666.99 or
698.03 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.

      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may

community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a

cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:

intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.

   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court

ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the Clerk of the Court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the Clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the State or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, State, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
698.03 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, if the
offender enters an Alford plea, the sentencing court shall not consider whether
the offender showed genuine remorse for the offense.
      (3)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
      (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a
court shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control
sanction or a combination of community control sanctions under §
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.

698.04 ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand

thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.

      (3)   A.   On the portion attributable to the Village of Westfield Center
of the net profits earned during the effective period of this chapter of all

(Ord. 1999-10. Passed 12-7-99.)
890.04 DETERMINATION OF INCOME SUBJECT TO TAX.
   (a)   Taxable Situs. In the taxation of income which is subject to Village
income taxes, if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or
profession both within and without the boundaries of the Village shall disclose
with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit is attributable to the
part of the business or profession conducted within the boundaries of the
Village, then only such portion shall be considered as having a taxable situs
of the Village for purposes of Village income taxation. In the absence of such
records, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the Village for purposes of Village income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of:
      (1)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Village during the taxable period to the average net book value of all of the
real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
         As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include
property rented or leased by the taxpayer, and the value of such property shall
be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
      (2)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Village to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed.
      (3)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Village to gross receipts
of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
so as to produce such result.
   (b)   Sales Made in the Village Defined. As used in subsection (a) hereof,
"sales made in the Village" means:
      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village, regardless of where title passes, if shipped or delivered from a
stock of goods within the Village.
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village, regardless of where title passes, even though transported from a
point outside the Village, if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the Village to purchases outside the Village, regardless of where
title passes, if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery
is made.
   (c)   Operating Loss Carry-Forward.
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
subsequent to the effective date of the "first" ordinance permitting loss
carry-forwards and allocable to the Village of Westfield Center, may be applied
against the portion of the profit of succeeding year(s) which is allocable to
the Village of Westfield Center, until exhausted, but in no event for more than
five taxable years. No portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back
against net profits of any prior year.
      (2)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the Village of Westfield Center in the same manner as provided herein for
allocating net profits to the Village of Westfield Center.
      (3)   The Administrator shall provide by rules and regulations the manner
in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.
   (d)   Consolidated Returns.
      (1)   The filing of consolidated returns may be permitted or required in
accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Administrator.
      (2)   In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or other activity within the
Village of Westfield Center constituting a portion only of its total business,
the Administrator shall require such additional information as he or she may
deem necessary to ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated to the
Village of Westfield Center. If the Administrator finds that net profits are
not properly allocated to the Village of Westfield Center by reason of
transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by stock
ownership, interlocking directorates, or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity, or by some other method, he or
she shall make such allocation as he or she deems appropriate to produce a fair
and proper allocation of net profits to the Village of Westfield Center.
   (e)   Exceptions. The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed as
levying a tax upon the following:
      (1)   Funds received from local governments or from the State or Federal
Government because of service in the Armed Forces of the United States by the
person rendering such service, or as a result of another person rendering such
service;
      (2)   Poor relief, pensions, Social Security, unemployment compensation,
disability benefits received from private industry, local governments, the
State or Federal Government, or charitable, religious or educational
organizations, and deferred compensation paid to retired individuals pursuant
to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan as defined in 26 USC 3121 (v)(2)
(C);
      (3)   Dues, contributions and similar payments received by charitable,
religious, educational or literary organizations or labor unions, lodges and
similar organizations;
      (4)   Receipts from casual entertainment, amusements, sports events and
health and welfare activities conducted by bona fide charitable, religious and/
or educational organizations and associations;
      (5)   Any association, organization, corporation, club or trust, which is
exempt from Federal taxes on income by reason of its charitable, religious,
educational, literary, scientific, etc., purposes;
      (6)   Gains from involuntary conversions, cancellation of indebtedness,
interest of Federal obligations, and income of a decedent's estate during the
period of administration (except such income from the operation of a business);
and
      (7)   Earnings and income of all persons under eighteen years of age,
whether residents or nonresidents.

890.06 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Each taxpayer, except as herein provided, shall, whether or not a tax
is due thereon, make and file a return on or before April 15 of the year
following the effective date of this chapter and on or before April 15 of each
year thereafter. When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period
different from the calendar year, the return shall be filed within ninety days
from the end of such fiscal year or period. The Administrator is hereby
authorized to provide by regulation that the return of an employer or
employers, showing the amount of tax deducted by said employer or employers,
from the salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation of an employee, and
paid by him or her to the Administrator, shall be accepted as the return
required of any employee whose sole income, subject to tax under this chapter,
is such salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation.
   (b)   The return shall be filed with the Administrator on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from such Administrator, setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amount of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned and the gross income from a business, profession or other
activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such gross
income. Such income shall include only income earned during the year, or
portion thereof, covered by the return and subject to the tax imposed by this
chapter.
      (2)   The amount of tax imposed by this chapter on income reported;
      (3)   Any credits to which the taxpayer may be entitled under the
provisions of Sections
890.07,
890.08 and
890.16; and
      (4)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns or other
information as the Administrator may require.
   (c)   The Administrator may extend the time for filing of the annual return
upon the request of the taxpayer for a period of not to exceed six months, or
one month beyond any extension requested of or granted by the Internal Revenue
Service for the filing of the Federal Income Tax Return.
   The Administrator may require a tentative return, accompanied by payment of
the amount of tax shown to be due thereon by the date the return is normally
due. No penalty or interest shall be assessed in those cases in which the
return is filed and the final tax paid within the period which is extended.
   (d)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of filing thereof, pay
to the Administrator the balance of tax due, if any, after deducting:
      (1)   The amount of Westfield Center income tax deducted or withheld at
the source, pursuant to Section
890.07;
      (2)   Such portion of the tax as has been paid on declaration by the
taxpayer pursuant to Section
890.08;
      (3)   Any credit allowable under the provisions of Section
890.16.
   Should the return, or the records of the Administrator, indicate an
overpayment of the tax to which the Village of Westfield Center is entitled
under the provisions of this chapter, such overpayment shall first be applied
against any existing liability and the balance, if any, at the election of the
taxpayer communicated to the Administrator, shall be refunded or transferred
against any subsequent liability, provided, however, that overpayment of less
than one dollar ($1.00) shall not be refunded.
   (e)   (1)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in
Sections
890.12 and
890.16. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting a Village taxpayer's tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended Village of Westfield Center return showing income
subject to the Village of Westfield Center tax based upon such final
determination of Federal tax liability, and pay any additional tax shown to be
due thereon or make a claim for a refund of any overpayment.
(Ord. 1999-10. Passed 12-7-99.)

earned by Westfield Center residents, regardless of where such compensation was
earned, and shall deduct the tax of one percent from the salaries, wages,
commissions or other compensation earned within Westfield Center by

municipality and the tax imposed by this chapter.
   (c)   Each such employer shall, on or before the last day of the month
following each calendar quarter, make a return and remit to the Village of

be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed therefor by the
Administrator. Such employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax
required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such taxes have in fact
been withheld.
   (d)   On or before the thirty-first day of January following any calendar
year, such employer shall file with the Administrator an information return for
each employee from whom Village of Westfield Center income tax has been, or
should have been, withheld, showing the name, address and Social Security
number of the employee, the total amount of compensation paid during the year
and the amount of Village of Westfield Center income tax withheld from such
employee.
   (e)   Such employer, in collecting said tax, shall be deemed to hold the
same, until payment is made by such employer to the Village of Westfield
Center, as a Trustee for the benefit of the Village of Westfield Center, and
any such tax collected by such employer from his or her employees shall, until
the same is paid to the Village of Westfield Center, be deemed a trust fund in

891.05 COLLECTION AT SOURCE

   (a)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
891.052 or division (d) or (f) of this section. An employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying
wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (a)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (b)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         A.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)B. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         B.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399.00), or if the total amount
of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on
behalf of the Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded two hundred dollars ($200.00). Payment(s) under division (b)(1)B. of
this section shall be made to the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days
after the last day of each month.
   (c)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
891.091.
   (d)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (e)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for Federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service Form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (i)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (k)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's

wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division

services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services at the
location for more than 20 days.

that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
891.051.

entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (b)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         A.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         B.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         C.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick

(2)C. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         E.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (c)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this

during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the 20-day threshold
described in division (b)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (d)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (d)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first 20 days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's principal
place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (e)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
891.03. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
   (f)   Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
891.051.
   (g)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on 12 or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this State that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (d) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds 12, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first 12 days for which the employer paid qualifying wages
to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on which the
individual performed services at the refinery.

3772.01, respectively, or a lottery sales agent conducting video lottery
terminals sales on behalf of the state to withhold and remit municipal income
tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages as provided in this
section.
   (b)   If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the Internal Revenue Service of the amount is required by Section

and withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the
tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is

for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator shall

providing the name, address, and social security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of
the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino
gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the
preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any
amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If

and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.

deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The Administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the amounts
deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         A.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         B.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (d)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by Section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (e)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (e) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with Ohio R.C. 5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (f)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
            If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (g)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (h)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to 50% of the tax deducted and
withheld;
      (2)   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or annual
return, a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each return not filed
or filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld
at the rate prescribed in Ohio R.C. 5703.47.
   (i)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section 891.07. This division applies only to the person for whom the amount is
deducted and withheld.
   (j)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

   “Municipal Taxable Income” for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (a)   “Income” reduced by “exempt income” to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any “Pre-2017 net
operating loss carry-forward” equals “Municipal taxable income”.
      (1)   “Income” for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the “net
profit” of the taxpayer.
         A.   “Net profit” for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
891.03(c)(23).
         B.   “Adjusted Federal taxable income” is defined in Section
891.03(c)(1).
      (2)   “Exempt income” is defined in Section
891.03(c)(11).
      (3)   “Apportionment” means the apportionment as determined by Section

APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Ohio
R.C. Chapter 5745.
   (a)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
891.052;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
891.19(a).
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
891.19(a).
      (4)   Nothing in division (b) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, “wages, salaries, and
other compensation” includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid

         B.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         C.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)B. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be

         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         B.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from a
location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (e)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
         A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (f)   (1)   Except as provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
891.081.
   (g)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Section 891.03(c)(11)L. and (c)(34)A.4., by a municipal
corporation to which the taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit,
the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the
taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no
case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned
to that municipal corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the
employee would be required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock
option not exempted from taxation.
         This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment
to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (h)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
          A.   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under Federal law.
         B.   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-

         C.   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (b)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

“Federal taxable income” wherever “Federal taxable income” appears in that
division and by substituting “an affiliated group of corporation's” for “a C
corporation's” wherever “a C corporation's” appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
891.03(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
891.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section 891.062, include the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the
computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
891.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
891.062 by substituting “consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to”
for “net profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in that section and by
substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for “taxpayer” wherever
“taxpayer” appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (h)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may

891.091.
         A.   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals and
are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is due

the taxable year.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
891.10 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the municipal
corporation under Section
891.091 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.

891.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID
891.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   It is the intent of this chapter that a resident taxpayer who is subject to
tax in more than one municipal corporation on the same income and who has
complied with the provisions of this chapter shall not be required by this
chapter to pay municipal income tax on such income greater than the tax imposed
at the higher rate. Accordingly, and notwithstanding any other provisions of
this chapter:
   (a)   When a resident of Westfield Center is subject to and has paid, or has
acknowledged liability for, income tax in another municipal corporation on the
same income taxable under this chapter, such Westfield Center resident may
claim a credit for the amount of such tax paid to such other municipal
corporation, but not in excess of the tax assessed by this chapter.
   (b)   The credit provided for in division (a) hereof will not be allowed
unless the credit is claimed in a timely return of form acceptable to and filed
with the Tax Administrator. In the event a taxpayer fails, neglects or refuses
to file such timely return of form, he or she shall not be entitled to such
credit and shall be liable for the full amount of tax assessed, together with
such interest and penalties, both civil and criminal, as are prescribed in this
chapter.
(Ord. 2015-17. Passed 12-1-15.)
891.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan” means a compensation plan
described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section,
“qualifying loss” means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for Federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         B.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the “qualifying loss” is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)A. of this
section computed without regard to division (a)(2)B. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   “Qualifying tax rate” means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the “qualifying tax rate”
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
(Ord. 2015-17. Passed 12-1-15.)
891.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
891.081.
(Ord. 2015-17. Passed 12-1-15.)
891.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
891.096.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
891.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (c)   No carry-forward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
891.096.
   (d)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
891.081 regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 2015-17. Passed 12-1-15.)
891.09 ANNUAL RETURN
891.091 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   (1)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
Municipal Taxable Income by the Municipality shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under Section

required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed

   (e)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (f)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service Form W-2, “Wage and Tax Statements,” including all information
reported on the taxpayer's Federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
Form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the

Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a

the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of State individual income tax returns under Ohio

Administrator.
         C.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
891.092 applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts
with any provision in Section
891.092, the provision in Section
891.092 prevails.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a

be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment

“The date of postmark” means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the Postal Service.

transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the

an employer, or other payer as described in Section

against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld
were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (m)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (n)   (1)   As used in this division, “worksite location” has the same
meaning as in Section
891.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         A.   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         B.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
               The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules.” The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (n)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (n) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
   (o)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.

file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (c)(2)A.
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, “qualifying taxpayer” means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of

the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (d)   For each taxable year to which division (a), (b), or (c) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (b)(2) and (3) or
(c) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (d)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (e)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing the
authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce the
provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 2015-17. Passed 12-1-15.)
891.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (a)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth

   (b)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic Federal extension for a
period other than six months for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal

for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (d)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (e)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall

Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any Federal or
State tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or
State tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section 891.19 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by Section
891.19(a)(2) for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10.00) or less,
no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth
in division (c)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
891.096. Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this section, the request
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (d)   When amending a return a change of accounting method shall be
prohibited.

withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten

forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (b)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
891.18.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (b) of this section shall be considered to have been

on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the Postal Service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section

any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to

for any of the reasons stated in division (c) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (g)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (j)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (f) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 2015-17. Passed 12-1-15.)
891.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Ohio R.C. 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. 2015-17. Passed 12-1-15.)
891.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
         A.   The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be
domiciled in the Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider
membership from individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality.
         B.   Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment.
         C.   One member shall be appointed by the top administrative official
of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of the Municipality, but
may not be the Director of Finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax
Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly involved in
municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The Board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Ohio R.C.
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   Members of the Local Board of Tax Review may receive reimbursement
of expenses for service on the Board.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60 days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within 60 days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a hearing to be
continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must
be completed within 120 days after the first day of the hearing unless the
parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within 90 days after the Board's final hearing on
the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to all
of the parties to the appeal within 15 days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board's
final determination as provided in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Ohio R.C. 149.43. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to Ohio R.C. 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.
   (g)   Any appeal of the Tax Administrator will be heard by the Local Board
of Tax Review.
(Ord. 2015-17. Passed 12-1-15; Ord. 2016-08. Passed 1-3-17.)
891.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, “qualifying deferral period” means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
891.18. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Local Board of Tax Review
with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have jurisdiction to
affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
891.096.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
891.18, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of
the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the amount due from
the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than the amount paid,
there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's assigns or legal
representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as provided by Section
891.096, with interest on that amount as provided by division (d) of this
section.
   (e)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

1046.01 UNIFORM GAS RATE.
   (a)   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 743.28, as amended, Council hereby notifies
Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc., and the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, of its
intent to negotiate jointly with other municipal corporations in the County for
the purpose of establishing a uniform gas rate.
   (b)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Company" means Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc.
      (2)   "Group of municipal corporations," "group of municipalities,"
"group" or "consortium" means those municipal corporations which, by ordinance
and written notification by the Mayors to the Company, have expressed their
intent to jointly negotiate a price schedule, until such time as any two or
more of such municipalities have jointly presented to the Company ordinances
setting or fixing a uniform price schedule for the product or service of the
Company. Thereafter, "group of municipal corporations," "group of
municipalities," "group" or "consortium" shall mean those municipal
corporations which have jointly presented to the Company ordinances which set
or fix a uniform price schedule for the product or service of the Company.
Those municipal corporations which pass rate ordinances establishing a uniform
price schedule and jointly present such rate ordinances to the company are,
upon such presentation, to be considered to be the group of municipal
corporations, regardless of whether each of the communities which had notified
the Company of its intent to participate in joint negotiations so present such
a rate ordinance, and notwithstanding any prior action by a municipal
corporation which does not so present to the company a rate ordinance
establishing a uniform price schedule.
      (3)   "Mayors" means the mayors of all the municipalities in the group of
municipal corporations.
      (4)   "Uniform rate" means a single gas rate which would apply to every
municipal corporation in the group of municipal corporations passing an
ordinance to adopt such a rate.
   (c)   Upon written receipt of a joint notification by the Mayors of the
group of municipalities which has enacted ordinances expressing a desire to
negotiate a uniform gas rate, the Village respectfully requests the Company to
commence negotiations with the uniform gas rate committee, to be comprised of
representatives from the Office of the Consumers' Counsel, as well as
representatives from the municipalities who choose to attend such negotiations.
Unless otherwise indicated, the Office of the Consumers' Counsel will act as
principal negotiator and all correspondence, communications, information, etc.,
shall be provided to the Office of the Consumers' Counsel.
   (d)   The date upon which the Company receives joint notification by the
Mayors shall be the date which designates the commencement of the first ninety-
day period of negotiations for a uniform gas rate.
   (e)   Where such negotiations do not, within ninety days after commencement,
result in an agreement between the group and the Company, the group may
exercise the rights of a municipal corporation under Ohio R.C. 743.26, on the
same basis as if it were a single municipal corporation, and enact a uniform
rate ordinance fixing and regulating the price that may be charged by the
Company, its successors or assigns, for gas to the group of municipal
corporations and to their inhabitants, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4909.34, as
amended.
   (f)   Should the Company refuse to accept the rates established by a uniform
rate ordinance and thereafter file a complaint with the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4909.34, as amended, the
Village requests the Commission to order the Company to file, under the
Commission's standard filing requirements, uniform information for the service
area of all municipalities in the group of municipal corporations, in order
that the Commission may establish a uniform rate which would apply to each
municipality in the group.
   (g)   The Village respectfully requests that the Company delay in submitting
to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio any formal application for an
increase in the rates to be charged and collected for gas service in the
Village of Westfield Center, for a period of not less than 180 days from the
date on which uniform rate negotiations commence, in order to allow the group
of municipalities two ninety-day negotiating periods to enact a uniform rate
ordinance.
   (h)   The Office of Consumers' Counsel is hereby designated as counsel for
the consortium in all matters and in all proceedings arising under this
chapter.
   (i)   This section shall become effective and operative on the date
delivered to the Company by Consumers' Counsel, the designated counsel herein,
but not prior to December 8, 1982, nor later than February 28, 1983.

   (d)   Urns, vases, potted flowers, wreaths and plastic or silk arrangements
may be placed on top of the ground at a gravesite as provided for in this
chapter, but no person shall dig holes of any kind to contain these otherwise
allowable decorations.
   (e)   No glass containers of any kind shall be permitted in the Village
Cemetery.
   (f)   Gravesites may be decorated for the summer season, provided that
summer decorations shall be removed no later than October 1 of each year and
all decorations not removed by October 1 of that year shall be destroyed by the
Village.
   (g)   Gravesites may be decorated for the winter season, provided that
winter decorations shall be removed no later than April 1 of each year and all
decorations not removed by April 1 of that year shall be destroyed by the
Village.
   (h)   The Village shall exhibit Cemetery lots for sale to persons desiring
to purchase the same and shall arrange for the sale of any lot or parcel upon
full payment of the purchase price. Upon delivery of said purchase price, the
Village shall execute and deliver a deed therefor to the purchaser.
   (i)   Ownership of lot(s)/niches may be transferred and/or assigned only
with the prior written consent of the Village, provided that the Village shall
have the option, at the time of the request for the Village's approval of the
transfer or assignment, to buy back any such lot(s)/niches at the original
purchase price charged by the Village.
      (1)   Gift provision. When the original owner of a Cemetery lot within
the Village Cemetery desires to make a gift of said lot, he or she must present
his or her deed to the Cemetery Committee. The Cemetery Committee will instruct
the Clerk-Treasurer to issue a new deed in the name of the donee and record
same on the official record. The new deed may be sent to the donor or donee at
the discretion of the Clerk-Treasurer. There will be no fee associated with
this transfer.
      (2)   Transfers on death of owner. An owner of any cemetery lot/niche may
transfer their lot/niche upon death in accordance with the provisions of either
paragraphs A. or B., below:
         A.   Testate succession provision. A cemetery lot/niche within the
Village Cemetery may be bequeathed by the will of said lot/niche owner to an
heir via a specific bequest in such owner’s will.
            Upon said owner's death, the deed, along with a copy of the will
certified by the probate court of the jurisdiction where it was probated must
be presented to the Cemetery Committee. Upon receipt of such documents, and
verification of the specific bequest language in the will, the Cemetery
Committee will direct that a new deed be issued to the heir(s) to whom the
specific bequest directed ownership of the lot/niche. The Clerk-Treasurer will
then be notified by the Cemetery Committee and will record the transfer.
         B.   Non-probate transfer. As an alternative to the testate succession
provision, an owner of any cemetery lot(s)/niche within the Village Cemetery
may designate a non-probate transferee of such lot/niche. Such designation
shall be made by the lot/niche owner by completing a designation at any time
subsequent to the owner’s purchase of the lot/niche on a Lot/Niche Transfer on
Death Designation Form established by the Cemetery Committee (the “TOD Form”).
For a TOD Form to be valid, it must clearly identify the lot/niche to be
transferred, state the name and relation of the intended transferee and must
specifically state the owner’s intention to replace, rescind, revoke and/or
supersede any prior instruments or TOD Form(s) related to the transfer
ownership of such lot/niche upon the owner’s death. The Cemetery Committee
shall also provide a form to rescind prior designations without appointing a
new TOD recipient.
            Upon an owner’s death, the deed, together with a certified copy of
the death certificate, and a TOD Form (if applicable) shall be delivered to the
Cemetery Committee in connection with the proposed transfer (the “Non-Probate
Transfer Documents”).
            If the Non-Probate Transfer Documents are accompanied by a copy of
the deceased owner’s will, certified by the probate court of the jurisdiction
where it was probated, and such will is dated prior to the date of the latest
TOD Form completed by owner or such will does not contain any specific bequests
related to the lot/niche identified on the owner’s TOD Form, the Cemetery
Committee shall immediately complete the transfer of the lot/niche to the
transferee identified in the TOD Form. If a certified copy of the probated will
is not presented with the Non-Probate Transfer Documents, the Cemetery
Committee shall complete the transfer of the lot/niche to the transferee
identified in the TOD Form no less than six months from the owner’s date of
death in order to provide time for a probated will to be produced.
         C.   Additional provisions related to transfer on death. Upon the
death of a lot/niche owner who has made designations under both paragraphs A.
and B., above, the Cemetery Committee shall enforce the last valid designation
made prior to such lot/niche owner’s death. Any Lot/Niche Transfer on Death
Designation Form that was executed but not actually delivered to and accepted
by the Village prior to the date of owner’s death shall be deemed invalid. Any
transfers made in compliance with this section shall be completed at no cost to
the lot/niche owner or the heir/transferee. No transfer pursuant to this
section shall be valid without the heirs or transferee presenting the documents
and meeting the other requirements of paragraph A. or B. above (as the case may
be) subsequent to such lot/niche owner’s death. Incomplete transfers that are
not completed by the heirs or transferee in accordance with the requirements of
this section shall remain subject to the reversionary provisions as contained
in Section
1062.04.
   (j)   A funeral director must be present and supervise the interment of body
that is interred in the Cemetery.
   (k)   The Village reserves the right to refuse to inter any body/cremains
due to unforeseen circumstances beyond its control.
   (l)   No person other than the Village shall be permitted to install
foundations for gravestones, headstones or other monuments, and the Village
shall have the authority to limit the permissible size of the individual
foundation and/or stone or monument. Gravestones, headstones or other monuments
may only be installed on foundations installed by the Village. Any person who
sells or installs stones or memorials and who violates these restrictions shall
be barred thereafter from placing any headstones, gravestones or other
memorials in the Cemetery, in addition to the penalty provided in Section
1062.99.
      (1)   A total of six cremains may be interred in a full body site.
Limited two markers: One upright marker and one flat marker or a total of two
flat markers.
      (2)   All 3' x 3' sites' memorials must be flat (4" x 12" x 24") of
granite or a bronze nameplate; either choice will have a footer cost. (A total
of two cremains can be interred in a 3' x 3' site.)
      (3)   Flat stones should be installed after interment due to logistics of
burial. Some provisions could be made if possible but would require prior
consultation with the Cemetery Sextant.
      (4)   Cremains must be in a rigid container for interment, or otherwise
be in a rigid container with a metallic tracer.
      (5)   A columbarium may be placed on a single lot with no more than six
cremains in any one structure and a size limitation of 48" D and 25" W.
Following the submission of a formal request, the Cemetery Committee could
grant a variance in certain situations.
      (6)   An upright monument or headstone shall be no higher than 45"
subject to approval by the Cemetery Committee. A formal request for a variance
can be made to the Cemetery Committee for consideration.
   (m)   The Village shall not be responsible for any damage to the memorial
stones caused by accident, act of God, vandalism or other cause of loss.
   (n)   All foundations and memorial stones shall be installed at the head of
the gravesite.
   (o)   The use of wooden vaults or wooden outer boxes is strictly forbidden
for full body interment.
   (p)   Arrangements for vaults are handled by the funeral director.
   (q)   The cemetery has a Columbarium with niche compartments. The following
regulation sections will apply to the owner of the niche(s):
      (1)   Owners of a niche(s) in the Columbarium may lay small plant/floral
arrangements by the structure. Rules of removal must comply with Sections (f)
and (g).
      (2)   Rules to transfer/sale a niche(s) via gift provision or testate
provision, must comply to Sections (h), (i) and (l).
      (3)   All engraving must be a Vermarco font for lettering.
   (r)   Small concrete pad located in the Cemetery is available for use during
committal service. It is the family’s responsibility to reserve the use of the
area with the Village, to provide any preferred covering, and to clean up the
area after services. The Village and its employees have no responsibility
concerning any issues arising from this use.

Required.” Such representative may require the submission of a sketch and such
other information as is pertinent to his or her determination hereunder. See
Ohio R.C. 711.131.
   (b)   Plat of Subdivision will not be required for the subdivisions not
involving the opening or extension of any street of easement of access and in
which past subdivision and development have so far proceeded that the
preparation and recording of a plat would serve no public or planning purpose.
The representative authorized to approve conveyances without a plat under the
authority of Ohio R.C. 711.131, shall likewise be authorized to approve
conveyances without a plat in such cases as are accepted herein. In case of
doubt, such representative may refer the question to the Planning Commission.
If such representative refuses approval for a subdivision without a plat, the
applicant may appeal to the Planning Commission.

disapproval.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13.)
1242.08   VARIANCES.
   (a)   Hardship. Where the Board of Zoning Appeals finds that extraordinary
hardships may result from strict compliance with any of the provisions of these
Subdivision Regulations, it may vary the same so that substantial justice may
be done and the public interest secured, provided that such variation will not
have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations.
   (a)   Conditions. In granting variances and modification the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall require such additional conditions as will, in its judgment,
secure substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements so varied
or modified.

CHAPTER 1244
Design Standards
1244.01   Purpose.
1244.02   General requirements.
1244.03   Dimensional standards.
1244.04   Design and construction.
1244.05   Telecommunications conduit placement.
1244.01   PURPOSE.
   Each individual subdivider's blueprint of today becomes a permanent part of
the community tomorrow. It is the objective of the Planning Commission to see
to it that the combination of many such blueprints will not result in a
formless patchwork, but rather in a unified pattern for an attractive,
economical and durable neighborhood. In order to achieve this purpose, it is
necessary for the Planning Commission to adopt and administer design standards
for subdivisions.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13.)
1244.02   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Physical Features. Streets shall be platted with appropriate regard
for topography, creeks, wooded areas and other natural features which would
enhance attractive development.
   (b)   Existing Streets. Existing streets, constructed or recorded, in
adjoining territory shall be continued at equal or greater width and in similar
alignment by streets proposed in the subdivision, unless variations are
recommended by the Planning Commission.
   (c)   Circulation. The street pattern shall provide ease of circulation
within the subdivision as well as convenient access to adjoining streets,
thoroughfares or un-subdivided land, as may be required by the Planning
Commission. Where a street will eventually be extended beyond the plat, but is
temporarily dead- ended, an interim turn around may be required.
   (d)   Un-Subdivided Portion of Tract. If the plat to be submitted includes
only part of the tract owned by the subdivider, the Planning Commission shall
require a sketch of a tentative future street system for the un-subdivided
portion.
   (e)   Street Intersections. Streets shall intersect as nearly at right
angles as possible.
   (f)   Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs shall not be longer than 800 feet, unless
necessitated by topography or other circumstances beyond the subdivider's
control.
   (g)   Alleys. Except where justified by special conditions, alleys will not
be approved in Residence Districts. At an intersection of alleys, a five-foot
chord shall cut off each corner. Dead-end alleys are prohibited.
   (h)   Half Streets. The street layout shall be planned to avoid half
streets, if possible. Where there exists a dedicated or platted half street
adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted, if
deemed necessary by the Planning Commission.
   (i)   Utility Easements. Where utilities are located outside of street
right-of-way lines, easements shall be provided. Easements along rear or side
lot lines are preferable, where possible.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13.)
1244.03   DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS.
   (a)   Minimum Right-of-Way Widths.
      (1)   Streets. The minimum right-of-way width for streets in subdivisions
shall be 50 feet, except on those streets designated by the Planning Commission
as collector streets, the minimum right-of-way width shall be 60 feet.
      (2)   Alleys. Twenty feet.
      (3)   Cross-walkways. Ten feet.
      (4)   Easements. Four feet on each side of the designated centerline or
such width as may be required for necessary maintenance of any utility
involved.
      (5)   Cul-de-sacs. All cul-de-sacs shall terminate in a circular area
with a minimum radius equal to the right-of-way of the approach street, unless
the Planning Commission approves a T or Y type of turning configuration.
   (b)   Minimum Pavement Widths.
      (1)   All streets.
         A.   Twenty-six feet, including curb, except that streets designated
as collector streets by the Commission, may be required, upon order of the
Commission, to be paved a width of 31 feet, including curbs. In the case of a
thoroughfare or important neighborhood street, the matter of additional
pavement width shall be discussed with the public officials having
jurisdiction, to determine whether or not public expenditures, if any, for such
additional width shall be made simultaneously with the developer's improvement.
         B.   Cul-de-sac streets shall terminate in a paved turnaround. The
median strip between the back of curbs and the property line shall be the same
as the approach street. If a T- or Y-shaped arrangement is approved by the
Commission in lieu of a turn-around, such paved space shall extend the entire
width of the street right-of-way and shall be at least one-half the width of
the approach street, with flared portions rounded by at least 12-1/2 feet
radii.
      (2)   Alleys. Twenty feet.
      (3)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be required on both sides of all
streets. They shall be concrete, four feet in width and four inches in depth,
in accordance with Exhibit III.
      (4)   Curbs. Roll concrete integral curbs and gutters shall be required
on all streets, as specified in Exhibit III following the text of these
Subdivision Regulations.
   (c)   Grades. Current ODOT standards.
   (d)   Intersections.
      (1)   At the intersection of two streets, property line corners shall be
rounded by an arc of 12-1/2 feet radius.
      (2)   Street curbs or edges of street pavements shall be rounded by radii
of at least 25 feet.
      (3)   The minimum radii noted above shall be increased when the smallest
angle of intersection is less than 60 degrees, or in any case where the
Planning Commission considers an increase necessary.
   (e)   Blocks.
      (1)   Length. The normal maximum length for blocks shall be 1,800 feet.
In a block over 900 feet long, a crosswalk may be required.
      (2)   Width. The width of a block shall normally be sufficient to allow
two tiers of lots of appropriate depth.
      (3)   Irregular shape. Irregularly shaped blocks (including super
blocks), indented by cul-de- sacs, containing interior parks or playgrounds and
adequate parking space, shall be acceptable when properly designed and covered
by agreements as to maintenance of such park areas.
      (4)   Orientation on Motor-way. If frontage on a motor-way is involved,
the long dimension of the block shall preferably front thereon, in order to
create as few intersections as possible with the motor-way.
   (f)   Lots.
      (1)   Size, shape and orientation. The size, shape and orientation of
lots shall be appropriate to the location of the proposed subdivision and for
the types of development contemplated.
      (2)   Length and width ratio. Excessive depth in relation to width shall
be avoided.
      (3)   Fronting on motor-ways. Lots fronting on motor-ways should have
extra depth and deep setbacks, if topography permits.
      (4)   Street or right-of-way. Every lot shall abut on a street or other
public right-of-way.
      (5)   Double frontage. Double frontage lots shall be avoided as far as
possible.
      (6)   Side lot lines. Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right
angles or radial to the street line, unless, in the opinion of the Planning
Commission, a variation from this rule will give a better street and lot plan.
      (7)   Corner lots. Corner lots shall have an extra width sufficient to
allow for building setback lines on both front and side.
   (g)   Public Open Spaces and Sites. Where, as indicated by the Master Plan,
a proposed Subdivision contains, wholly or in part, a proposed public open
space or a proposed site for a public building, the Planning Commission will
immediately notify the public authority concerned (Council, the Board of County
Commissioners, the Park Board, the Board of Education, etc.). If, within 30
days thereafter, the Planning Commission is not advised that such property has
been acquired by negotiation and agreement, or within a second period of 30
days after such notification that such authority has commenced the necessary
procedure to acquire such property by appropriation, then the Planning
Commission will not require that such open space or site be reserved or
included in the subdivision plan.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13.)
1244.04   DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION.
   All streets or sections of streets shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with Exhibit III. Residential streets shall be constructed of either
seven-inch non-reinforced concrete pavement in accordance with the
specifications of the State of Ohio, Department of Transportation, or two
layers of one and one-half-inch asphalt concrete (limestone aggregate) over a
six-inch bituminous aggregate base (two layers). Residential streets shall be
26 feet wide, face to face, not including the curb on either side. Collector
streets, again, shall be constructed of either of the above materials and shall
be 30 feet wide, face to face, not including the curb on either side. All curbs
are to be constructed integral with the pavement. Contraction joints will be
sawed in the pavement at 17-foot intervals, and will extend through the curb.
Formed joints will not be permitted. Skewed transverse joints shall be used.
Expansion joints will be constructed at all intersections and will meet the
requirements of the specifications of the State of Ohio, Department of
Transportation. After completion of the pavement, all joints will be sealed
with joint sealer meeting the requirements of the specifications of the State
of Ohio, Department of Transportation. All sub- grades, storm sewers, catch
basins and other details relative to the construction of the completed street
will meet the requirements of Exhibit III and the Construction and Material
Specifications of the State of Ohio, Department of Transportation, the latest
edition.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13.)
1244.05 TELECOMMUNICATIONS CONDUIT PLACEMENT.
   (a)   All developments shall be required to obtain and install
telecommunications conduit, to run from structures to publicly maintained and
owned streets and roadways not incorporated within the development. This
conduit is for the purpose of installation of fiber optic cable or similar
telecommunications cabling, as available as follows:
      (1)   Conduit shall be obtained and installed while other utility lines
and piping for each structure are being installed below ground, i.e. while the
earth is disturbed;
      (2)   This section shall apply to both residential and commercial/
industrial developments;
      (3)   Conduit shall be installed in cases both of original construction
and any significant renovation or reconstruction, should such project require
the disturbance of the ground for other utility purposes; and
      (4)   This section shall not apply in cases of emergency repair or
maintenance of utility lines or piping.
   (b)   Conduit shall be placed at horizontal and vertical locations, and with
such capacity, as determined by the Planning Commission. Owner shall submit the
approved site plan, drawn to scale and identifying the locations and depth of
the conduit.
   (c)   In cases where development includes streets or roadways to be
converted to the Village of Westfield Center ownership and maintenance, conduit
once installed becomes the property of the Village of Westfield Center and
shall be documented on the development improvement plans.

1247.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable storm water management standards to achieve a level
of storm water quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the Village of Westfield Center.
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property with the Village of Westfield Center to:
      (1)   Control storm water runoff from their property and ensure that all
storm water management practices are property designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control volume, rate, and quality of storm water runoff originating
from their property so that surface water and ground water are protected and
flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate storm water quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate storm water management.
      (8)   Maximize use of storm water management practices that serve
multiple purposes including, but not limited to, flood control, erosion
control, fire protection, water quality protection, recreation, and habitat
preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the Village of Westfield
Center maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; buildings activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section
1247.01.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Medina County, and the
Village of Westfield Center shall comply with this regulation for roadway
projects.
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (f)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Storm Water
Management Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility
line installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface
as determined by the Zoning Inspector. Such projects must be designed to
minimize the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear
construction projects must comply with the requirements of
Chapter 1248 Erosion and Sediment Control.

1247.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General: The storm water system, including storm water management
practices for storage, treatment and control, and conveyance facilities, shall
be designed to prevent structure flooding during the 100 year, 24-hour storm
event; to maintain predevelopment runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to
meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources:
The storm water management practices shall function as an integrated system
that controls flooding and minimizes the degradation of the physical,
biological, and chemical integrity of the water resources receiving storm water
discharges from the site. Acceptable practices shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project and complies with
Chapter 1249, Riparian Setbacks.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing storm water peak flows to less than
pre-development levels. Storm water management practices that meet the criteria
in this regulation, and additional criteria required by the Village Engineer,
shall comply with this Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use: Storm water management practices
shall be designed to achieve the storm water management objectives of this
regulation, to be compatible with the proposed post-construction use of the
site, to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and to function safely
with minimal maintenance.
      (3)   Storm water management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Title Three, Subdivision Control, shall provide
storm water management for the development of all subdivided lots. This shall
include provisions for lot grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding
during the 100 year, 24-hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable,
the pre-development runoff patterns, volumes, and peaks from the lot.
      (4)   Storm water facilities in water resources: Storm water management
practices and related activities shall not be constructed in water resources
unless the applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits
from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state and
local agencies as required in Section
1247.07  and the activity is in compliance with
Chapter 1248, Erosion and Sediment Control and
Chapter 1249, Riparian Setbacks, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
      (5)   Storm water pond and surface conveyance channels: All storm water
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100
year, 24-hour storm. When designing storm water ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption: The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
1247.09  if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that
the site is part of a larger common plan of development where the storm water
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing storm water
management practice, or if the storm water management requirements for the site
are provided by practices defined in a regional or local storm water management
plan approved by the Village Engineer.
      (7)   Maintenance: All storm water management practices shall be
maintained in accordance with inspection and maintenance agreements approved by
the Village Engineer as detailed in Section
1247.08 .
      (8)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the Village of Westfield
Center, storm water management practices serving multiple lots in subdivisions
shall be on a separate lot held and maintained by an entity of common ownership
or, if compensated by the property owners, by the Village of Westfield Center.
Storm water management practices serving single lots shall be placed on these
lots, protected within an easement, and maintained by the property owner.
      (9)   Preservation of existing natural drainage: Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation; and maintaining un-concentrated storm water runoff to and
through these areas.
   (b)   Storm Water Conveyance Design Criteria: All storm water management
practices shall be designed to convey storm water to allow for the maximum
removal of pollutants and reduction in flow velocities. This shall include but
not be limited to:
      (1)   Stream relocation or enclosure: The Village Engineer may allow the
enclosure or relocation of water resources only if the applicant shows proof of
compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps,
and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as required in Section
1247.07 , and the activity is in compliance with
Chapter 1248 , Erosion and Sediment Control and
Chapter 1249 , Riparian Setbacks, all as determined by the Village Engineer. At
a minimum, stream relocation designs must show how the project will minimize
changes to the vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat
of upstream and downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site storm water discharges: Off-site storm water runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the storm water conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around storm water quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the storm water quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that off-
site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a
manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow: The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other storm water management practice from areas too long and/or too large to
maintain sheet flow, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
      (4)   Open channels: Unless otherwise allowed by the Village Engineer,
drainage tributary to storm water management practices shall be provided by an
open channel with landscaped banks and designed to carry the ten year, 24-hour
storm water runoff from upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall e preferred on
all new development sites to convey storm water where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under the Village of Westfield Center zoning or where the use of an
open drainage system affects public health or safety, all as determined by the
Village Engineer. The following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer
systems when necessary:
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the ten year, 24-hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
25 year, 24-hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributory area within the proposed
development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream from the
development.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the Village Engineer.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tail-water of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tail-water elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water resource crossings: The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the Village of Westfield
Center:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25 year, 24-hour storm.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers, cold
water habitat, exceptional warm water habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, 25% of the
cross-sectional area or a minimum of one foot of box culverts and pipe arches
must be embedded below the channel bed.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a ten
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tail-water of the receiving facility or water resource. The tail-water
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of five square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bank full elevation to restrict head
loss differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100 year
storm event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100 year,
24-hour storm, or the 100 year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding: Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey storm water runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or storm water management practice such that the
runoff is contained within the drainage easement for the flood routing path and
does not cause flooding of or related structures. The buildings peak 100 year
water surface elevation along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot
below the finished grade elevation at the structure. When designing the flood
routing paths, the conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be
taken into consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the Village of Westfield
Center must be compensated by removing an equivalent volume of material. First
consideration for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be
given to areas where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new
floodplain within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also
be given to enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for
floodplain fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing
watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by the Village of Westfield Center,
reductions in volume due to floodplain fills must be mitigated within the legal
boundaries of the development. Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage
areas must reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed
area. The use of vertical retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Storm Water Quality Control:
      (1)   Direct runoff to a BMP: The site shall be designed to direct runoff
to one or more of the following storm water management practices. These
practices are listed in Table 2 of this regulation and shall be designed to
meet the following general performance standards:
         A.   Extended conveyance facilities that slow the rate of storm water
runoff; filter and biodegrade pollutants in storm water; promote infiltration
and evapotranspiration of storm water; and discharge the controlled runoff to a
water resource.
         B.   Extended detention facilities that detain storm water; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled storm water to a
water resource.
         C.   Infiltration facilities that retain storm water; promote
settling, filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured
storm water into the ground. The Village Engineer may require a soil
engineering report to be prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed
infiltration facilities meet these performance standards.
         D.   The Village Engineer may approve other BMPs if the applicant
demonstrates to the Village Engineer satisfaction that these BMPs meet the
objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
1247.09.
      (2)   Criteria applying to all storm water management practices:
Practices chosen must be sized to treat the water quality volume (WQV) and to
ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1).
         A.   The WQV shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.90 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            1.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the Village
Engineer that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific hydrologic
parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration characteristics,
slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed best management practices
controlling the amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local long-
term hourly records, or
            2.   Using the following equation: WQV = C*P*A/12
               Where terms have the following meanings:
               WQV = water quality volume in acre-feet
               C = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1 in.
               P = 0.90 inch precipitation depth
               A = area draining into the storm water practice, in acres.
               Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency (Ohio EPA) for use in determining the water quality volume
are listed in Table 1. Alternatively, the Village Engineer may consider use of
the following equation to calculate the runoff coefficient if the applicant can
demonstrate that appropriate controls are in place to limit the proposed
impervious area of the development:
               C = 0.858i3- 0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:
               i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
 
TABLE 1: RUNOFF COEFFICIENTS BASED ON THE TYPE OF LAND USE
LAND USE                                        RUNOFF COEFFICIENT
Industrial & Commercial                         0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)    0.5
Medium Density Residential (4-8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)     0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas               0.2
 
            Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be
calculated using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing
drainage area to the storm water treatment structure is low density
residential, 30% is high density residential, and 10% is open space, the runoff
coefficient is calculated as follows: (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1)(0.2) = (0.35)
         B.   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQV shall be
incorporated into the storm water practice for sediment storage.
         C.   Storm water quality management practices shall be designed such
that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment and protect against
downstream bank erosion, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events as defined in Table 2.

*Size to pass a hydrograph with a volume equal to the WQV, a
duration of 2 hours, and peak rainfall intensity of 1 inch/
hour at a depth of no more than 3 inches. The use of this     
criterion is limited to sites where the total area disturbed
is 5 acres or less.
**provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention     
volume above the permanent pool, each sized with 0.90 WQV.
 
         D.   Each practice shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control and other maintenance activities defined
in the inspection and maintenance agreement for the site.
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities:
         A.   Infiltration facilities shall only be allowed if the soils of the
facility fall within hydrologic soil groups A or B, and if the seasonal high
water table and any underlying bedrock are at least six feet below the final
grade elevation.
         B.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through an extended conveyance facility to remove coarser sediments that could
cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         C.   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site. No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria applying to extended conveyance facilities:
         A.   Facilities shall be lined with fine turf-forming, flood tolerant
grasses.
         B.   Facilities designed according to the extended conveyance
detention design drain time shall:
            1.   Not be located in areas where the depth to bedrock and/or
seasonal high water table is less than three feet below the final grade
elevation.
            2.   Only be allowed where the underlying soil consists of
hydrologic soil group (HSG) A or B, unless the underlying soil is replaced by
at least two and one-half feet deep layer of soil amendment with a permeability
equivalent to a HSG A or B soil and an underdrain system is provided.
         C.   Facilities designed according to the flow through design drain
time shall:
            1.   Only be allowed on sites where the total area disturbed is
five acres or less.
            2.   Be designed to slow and filter runoff flowing through the turf
grasses with a maximum depth of flow no greater than three inches.
         D.   Concentrated runoff shall be converted to sheet flow before
entering an extended conveyance facility designed according to the flow through
drain time.
      (5)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities:
         A.   The outlet shall be designed to release the bottom 50% of the
water quality volume in no less than two thirds of the drain time. A valve
shall be provided to drain any permanent pool volume for removal of accumulated
sediments. The outlet shall be designed to minimize clogging, vandalism, and
maintenance.
         B.   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            1.   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run to
rise ration of 4:1 or fatter.
            2.   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than four
feet shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least eight feet
and no more than 15 feet outward from the normal water edge. The eight feet
wide portion of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an
average depth of six inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of
aquatic vegetation. The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than 15
inches below the permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to individuals who
accidentally or intentionally enter the basin, and to limit growth of dense
vegetation in a manner that allows waves and mosquito predators to pass through
the vegetation. The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall be ten to one [(10
(H) to 1 (V))]. The aquatic bench shall be planted with hearty plants
comparable to wetland vegetation that are able to withstand prolonged
inundation.
            3.   A fore bay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at basin inlets. The fore bay volume shall be equal to
at least 10% of the water quality volume (WQV).
      (6)   Additional criteria applying to extended conveyance facilities:
         A.   Facilities shall be lined with fine turf-forming, flood tolerant
grasses.
         B.   Facilities designed according to the extended detention design
drain time shall:
            1.   Not be located in areas where the depth to bedrock and/or
seasonal high water table is less than three feet below the final grade

hydrologic soil group (HSG) A or B, unless the underlying soil is replaced by
at least a two and one- half feet deep layer of soil amendment with a
permeability equivalent to a HSG A or B soil and an underdrain system is
provided.
         C.   Swales and filter strips designed according to the flow through
drain time shall:
            1.   Only be allowed on sites where the total area disturbed is

      (7)   Alternative post-construction BMP: The applicant may request
approval from the Village Engineer for the use of alternative structural post-
construction BMPs if the applicant shows, to the satisfaction of the Village
Engineer and with prior written approval from Ohio EPA that these BMPs are
equivalent in pollutant removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness
to those listed in Table 2.
   (d)   Storm Water Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Storm Water Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed storm water management practices are
designed to meet the following requirements for storm water quantity control
for each watershed in the development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the critical storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a one year, 24-hour storm
occurring on the same development drainage area under pre-development
conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
critical storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions. The one-, two-, five-, ten-, 25-, 50-,
and 100-year storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this
requirement.
      (3)   The critical storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method that
generates hydrographs, or other hydrologic method approved by the Village
Engineer, the total volume (acre-feet) of runoff from a one year, 24-hour storm
occurring on the development drainage area before and after development. These
calculations shall meet the following standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition must reflect
the average type of land used over the past ten years and not only the current
land use.
            4.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the
site, calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or
concrete for all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface
proposed in the site description.
         B.   From the volume determined in Section
1247.09(d)(3)A., determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the 24-hour critical storm from Table
3.
TABLE 3: 24-HOUR CRITICAL STORM
IF THE PERCENTAGE OF INCREASE IN VOLUME OF RUNOFF THE CRITICAL STORM WILL BE:
IS:
EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN: AND LESS THAN:
TABLE 3: 24-HOUR CRITICAL STORM
IF THE PERCENTAGE OF INCREASE IN VOLUME OF RUNOFF THE CRITICAL STORM WILL BE:
IS:
EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN: AND LESS THAN:
----                      10                      1 year
10                        20                      2 years
20                        50                      5 years
50                        100                     10 years
100                       250                     25 years
250                       500                     50 years
500                       ----                     
For example, if the percent increase between the pre and post development
runoff volume for a one year storm is 35%, the critical storm is a five year
storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the one
year frequency storm under pre development conditions in the development
drainage area. The post development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
 
   (e)   Storm Water Management on Redevelopment Projects: Comprehensive Storm
Water Management Plans for redevelopment projects shall reduce existing site
impervious areas by at least 20%. Where site conditions prevent the reduction
of impervious area, then storm water management practices shall be implemented
to provide storm water quality control facilities for at least 20% of the
site's impervious area. When a combination of impervious area reduction and
storm water quality control facilities is used, the combined area shall equal
or exceed 20% of the site. Where conditions prevent impervious area reduction
or on-site storm water management for redevelopment projects practical
alternatives as detailed in Section
1247.10  may be approved by the Village Engineer.
(Ord. 2019-04. Passed 4-2-19.)
1247.10 ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   (a)   When the Village of Westfield determines that site constraints
compromise the intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used
that result in an improvement of water quality and a reduction of storm water
quantity. Such alternatives shall meet the following standards:
      (1)   Shall achieve the same level of storm water quantity and quality
control that would be achieved by the on-site controls required under this
Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   Implemented in the drainage area of the proposed development
project to the maximum extent practicable.
   (b)   Alternative actions may include, but are not limited to the following.
All alternative actions shall be approved by the Village Engineers:
      (1)   Fees, in an amount specified by the Village of Westfield Center, to
be applied to community wide storm water management practices.
      (2)   Implemented in the drainage area of the proposed development
project to the maximum extent practicable.
      (3)   Stream, floodplain, or wetland restoration.
      (4)   Acquisition or conservation easements on protected open space
significantly contributing to storm water control such as wetland complexes.
(Ord. 2019-04. Passed 4-2-19.)
1247.11 EASEMENTS.
   Access to storm water management practices as required by the Village
Engineer for inspections and maintenance shall be secured by easements. The
following conditions shall apply to all easements:
   (a)   Easements shall be included in the inspection and maintenance
agreement submitted with the Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan.
   (b)   Easements shall be approved by the Village of Westfield Center prior
to approval of a final plat and shall be recorded with the Medina County
Auditor and on all property deeds.
   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the Village Engineer, access easements
between a public right of-way and all storm water management practices shall be
no less than 25 feet wide. The easement shall also incorporate the entire
practice plus an additional 25 foot wide band around the perimeter of the storm
water management practice.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the inspection and maintenance agreement for the site.
   (e)   Easements to structural storm water management practices shall be
restricted against the construction therein of buildings, fences, walls, and
other structures that may obstruct the free flow of storm water and the passage
of inspectors and maintenance equipment; and against the changing of final
grade from that described by the final grading plan approved by the Village of
Westfield Center. Any re-grading and/or obstruction placed within a maintenance
easement may be removed by the Village of Westfield Center at the property
owners' expense.
(Ord. 2019-04. Passed 4-2-19.)
1247.12 MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
   To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed and provided to the Village Engineer:
   (a)   Final stabilization must be achieved and all permanent storm water
management practices must be installed and made functional, as determined by
the Village Engineer and per the approved Comprehensive Storm Water Management
Plan.
   (b)   An As-Built Certification, including a survey and inspection, must be
sealed, signed and dated by a professional engineer and a professional surveyor
with a statement certifying that the storm water management practices, as
designed and installed, meet the requirements of the Comprehensive Storm Water
Management Plan approved by the Village Engineer. In evaluating this
certification, the Village Engineer may require the submission of a new set of
storm water practice calculations if he/she determines that the design was
altered significantly from the approved Comprehensive Storm Water Management
Plan. The as-built survey must provide the location, dimensions, and bearing of
such practices and include the entity responsible for long-term maintenance as
detailed in the inspection and maintenance agreement.
   (c)   A copy of the complete and recorded inspection and maintenance
agreement as specified in Section
1247.08 must be provided to the Zoning Inspector.
(Ord. 2019-04. Passed 4-2-19.)
1247.13 ON-GOING INSPECTIONS.
   The Village of Westfield Center shall inspect storm water management
practices periodically. Upon finding a malfunction or other need for
maintenance, the Village of Westfield Center shall provide written notification
to the responsible party, as detailed in the inspection and maintenance
agreement, of the need for maintenance. Upon notification, the responsible
party shall have five working days, or other mutually agreed upon time, to
makes repairs or submit a plan with detailed action items and established
timelines. Should repairs not be made within this time, or a plan approved by
the Village Engineer for these repairs not be in place, the Village of
Westfield Center may undertake the necessary repairs and assess the responsible
party.
(Ord. 2019-04. Passed 4-2-19.)
1247.14 FEES.
   The Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan review, filing, and inspection
fee is part of a complete submittal and is required to be submitted to the
Village of Westfield Center before the review process begins. The schedule of
fees shall be established by the Village of Westfield Center Planning
Commission. (
Exhibit V, Fee Schedule)
(Ord. 2019-04. Passed 4-2-19.)
1247.15 BOND.
   (a)   If a Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan is required by this
regulation, soil- disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a cash
bond of 5% of the total project cost, has been deposited with the Village of
Westfield Center Fiscal Officer. This bond shall be posted for Village of
Westfield Center to perform the obligations otherwise to be performed by the
owner of the development area as stated in this regulation and to allow all
work to be performed as needed in the event that the applicant fails to comply
with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. The storm water bond will be
returned, when the following three criteria are met:
      (1)   After 80% of the lots of the project have been complete or 100% of
the total project has been permanently stabilized or three years from the time
of permanent stabilization have passed.
      (2)   An as built inspection of all water quality practices is conducted
by the Village Engineer.
      (3)   An inspection and maintenance agreement signed by the developer,
the contractor, the Village of Westfield Center, and the private owner or
homeowners association who will take long term responsibility for these BMPs,
is accepted by the Village Engineer.
   (b)   Once these criteria are met, the applicant shall be reimbursed all
bond monies that were not used for any part of the project. If all of these
criteria are not met after three years of permanent stabilization of the site,
the Village of Westfield Center may use the bond monies to fix any outstanding
issues with all storm water management structures on the site and the remainder
of the bond shall be given to the private lot owner/homeowners association for
the purpose of long term maintenance of the project.
(Ord. 2019-04. Passed 4-2-19.)
1247.16 INSTALLATION OF WATER QUALITY BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The applicant may not direct runoff through any water quality structures or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the Village Engineer. This occurs after the completion of the
final grade at the site, after all of the utilities are installed, and the site
is subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other appropriate methods. The
developer must provide documentation acceptable to the Village Engineer to
demonstrate that the site is completely stabilized. Upon this proof of
compliance, the water quality structure(s) may be completed and placed into
service. Upon completion of installation of these practices, all disturbed
areas and/or exposed soils caused by the installation of these practices must
be stabilized within two days.
(Ord. 2019-04. Passed 4-2-19.)

1248.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each or construction activity the appropriate control
measures; the general sequence during the construction process under which the
measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for implementation
(e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter controls and
contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final stabilization). The
controls shall include the following minimum components:
   (a)   Non-structural Preservation Measures: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing or
grubbing practices.
   (b)   Erosion Control Practices: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. A description of
control practices designed to re-stabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover. Erosion control practices must meet the following
requirement:
      (1)   Stabilization: Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.

winter.
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization
techniques must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion
matting.
 
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels: Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide.
   (c)   Runoff Control Practices: The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
   (d)   Sediment Control Practices: The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas. Structural practices shall be used
to control erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more
than 14 days. Such practices may include, among others: sediment settling
ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or
channels which direct runoff to a sediment settling pond. All sediment control
practices must be capable of ponding runoff in order to be considered
functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a
sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond. Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven days from the
start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is re-stabilized. As construction progresses and the
topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing
controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds: Concentrated storm water runoff and runoff
from drainage areas that exceed the design capacity of silt fence or inlet
protection, as determined in Table 3 below, shall pass through a sediment
settling pond or equivalent best management practice upon approval from the
Village Engineer and/or the Medina SWCD.
            The sediment-settling pond shall be sized to provide at least 67
cubic yards of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area. When
determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas
which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless
runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is
not comingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the sediment-settling
pond must be less than or equal to five feet. The configuration between the
inlets and the outlet of the basin must provide at least two units of length
for each one unit of width (> 2:1 length: width ratio). Sediment must be
removed from the sediment-settling pond when the design capacity has been
reduced by 40%. This limit is typically reached when sediment occupies one-half
of the basin depth. When designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must
consider public safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design
factor for the sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used
where site limitations would preclude a safe design. The use of a combination
of sediment and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant
removal is encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions: Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties, water resources, and wetlands from sediment transported via sheet
flow. Where intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on
a level contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The
relationship between the maximum drainage areas to silt fence for a particular
slope range is shown in Table 3 below. Storm water diversion practices shall be
used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices,
which include swales, dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas
up to ten acres.
 
TABLE 3: MAXIMUM DRAINAGE AREA TO SILT FENCE
MAXIMUM DRAINAGE AREA (ACRES) TO 100 RANGE OF SLOPE FOR A DRAINAGE AREA (%):
LINEAR FEET OF SILT FENCE:
0.5                                  < 2%
0.25                                 > 2% BUT < 20%
0.125                                > 20% BUT < 50%
 
      (4)   Inlet protection: Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. Straw or hay bales are not acceptable
forms of inlet protection.
      (5)   Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control: Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These entrances
shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled concrete or
cement sized greater than two inches in diameter, placed over a geotextile
fabric, and constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent
edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Streets directly adjacent to construction entrances and receiving
traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned daily to remove sediment
tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on these streets nearest to
the construction entrances shall also be cleaned weekly.
               Based on site conditions, the Village Engineer and/or the Medina
SWCD may require additional best management practices to control off site
tracking and dust. These additional BMPs may include:
            1.   Silt fence or construction fence installed around the
perimeter of the development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to
designated construction entrances.
            2.   Designated wheel-washing areas: Wash water from these areas
must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-settling pond, or
to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section 1248.09(g) of this
regulation.
         C.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The Village Engineer and/or the Medina
SWCD may require dust controls including the use of water trucks to wet
disturbed areas, tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed
areas, and regulation of the speed of vehicles on the site.
      (6)   Stream protection: Construction vehicles shall avoid water
resources and wetlands. If the applicant is permitted to disturb areas within
50 feet of a water resource or wetland, the following conditions shall be
addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources or wetlands from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in a water resource
or wetland.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
      (7)   Modifying control. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (e)   Non-sediment Pollutant Controls: No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources or wetlands.
These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Waste materials: A covered Dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      (2)   Concrete truck wash out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
      (3)   Fuel/liquid tank storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of all
containers in the storage area.
      (4)   Toxic or hazardous waste disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.
      (5)   Contaminated oil disposal and runoff: Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
   (f)   Compliance with Other Requirements: The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable state and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (g)   Trench and Ground Water Control: There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (h)   Internal Inspections: All controls on the site shall be inspected at
least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event
greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The applicant shall
assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these inspections to ensure
that the control practices are functional and to evaluate whether the SWP3 is
adequate, or whether additional control measures are required. Qualified
inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and experience in the
installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion controls. These
inspections shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (2)   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall
be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The applicant shall
utilize an inspection form provided by the Village of Westfield Center or an
alternate form acceptable to the Village Engineer.
      (3)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
      (4)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (5)   The applicant shall maintain for three years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
noncompliance determined by these inspections.
   (i)   Maintenance: The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization. The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by the Village Engineer. When inspections reveal
the need for repair, replacement, or installation of erosion and sediment
control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   When practices require repair or maintenance: If an internal
inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance,
with the exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or
maintained within three days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be
repaired or maintained within ten days of the inspection.
      (2)   When practices fail to provide their intended function: If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its
intended function as detailed in the SWP3 and that another more appropriate
control practice is required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control
practice must be installed within ten days of the inspection.
      (3)   When practices depicted on the WP3 are not installed: If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection reveals
that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a
statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
   (j)   Final Stabilization: Final stabilization shall be determined by the
Village Engineer.

1249.10   Inspection of riparian setbacks.
1249.11   Nonconforming structures or uses in the riparian setback.
1249.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The specific purpose and intent of these regulations is to regulate
buildings, structures or uses, and related soil disturbing activities within
riparian setback areas that would impair the ability of these areas to:
   (a)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity of
floodwaters, and regulating base flow.
   (b)   Assist in stabilizing the banks of designated watercourses to reduce
woody debris from fallen or damaged trees, stream bank erosion, and the
downstream transport of sediments eroded from such watercourse banks.
   (c)   Reduce pollutants in designated watercourses during periods of high
flows by filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants already present in
such watercourses.
   (d)   Reduce pollutants in designated watercourses by filtering, settling,
and transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter such watercourses.
   (e)   Provide designated watercourse habitats with shade and food.
   (f)   Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain a diverse
aquatic system.
   (g)   Provide riparian habitat with a wide array of wildlife by maintaining
diverse and connected riparian vegetation.
   (h)   Minimize encroachment on designated watercourses and limiting the
potential need for invasive measures that may otherwise be necessary to protect
buildings, structures, and uses as well as to reduce the damage to real
property and threats to public health and safety within the affected watershed.
   (i)   Preserve and conserve the quality and free flowing condition of
designated watercourses in the interest of promoting and protecting public
health and safety.
   These regulations have been enacted to protect and enhance the functions of
riparian areas by providing reasonable controls governing buildings,
structures, uses, and related soil disturbing activities within a riparian
setback along designated watercourses in the Village. Due to the importance of
functioning riparian areas, it is the intent and purpose of these regulations
that minimum riparian setbacks be given preference over minimum front, side,
and rear yard setbacks, in consideration of an appeal for a variance by the
Board of Zoning Appeals.

Ordinance.
   (b)   Applications and Appeals.

be made to the Board on application, after notice to the Zoning Inspector.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13; Ord. 2019-04. Passed 4-2-19.)
1262.03   POWERS AND DUTIES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have jurisdiction and shall have the
specific and general duties and powers in matters set forth in this Zoning
Ordinance.
   (a)   Special Exceptions. The Board shall have the power, in specific cases,
to hear and to grant or refuse to grant applications, in accordance with the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance and filed as herein before provided and to
authorize or refuse to authorize a zoning permit or certificate of use, for the
special exceptions set forth in this subsection.
      (1)   The special exceptions described in Section
1280.02(a).
      (2)   The substitution for a non-conforming use of another non-conforming
use which, in the opinion of the Board of Zoning Appeals, is of the same or a
less objectionable nature with respect to its effect on the neighborhood,
provided that no structural alterations, except such as are required by law or
ordinance, are made in any structure.
      (3)   The extension of a non-conforming use throughout a structure,
manifestly designed for such use, provided that no structural alterations,
except such as are required by law or ordinance, is made therein.
      (4)   The temporary use of a structure or of land in any district for a
purpose or use which does not conform to the regulations prescribed by this
Zoning Ordinance for the district in which it is located, provided that such
use is of a true temporary nature and does not involve the erection of
substantial structures. A zoning permit for such temporary use shall be
revocable and for not more than a 12-month period, subject to such conditions
as will safeguard the public health, safety, convenience, comfort and general
welfare.
      In authorizing a special exception, the Board may attach thereto such
conditions or requirements governing the location, character or other features
of the proposed structure or use and its maintenance, occupancy or operation,
as the Board may deem necessary in furtherance of the purposes of this Zoning
Ordinance.
   (b)   Variances. The Board shall have the power to authorize, on appeal, in
specific cases, any variances from the terms of this Zoning Ordinance as will
not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions of
the appellant's lots or to existing uses or structures on adjoining lots, a
literal enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance will result in
undue hardship, so as to relieve such hardship and so that the intent of this
Zoning Ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done. In authorizing
a variance, the Board may attach thereto such conditions or requirements
governing the location, character or other features of the proposed structure
or use and its maintenance, occupancy and operation, as the Board may deem
necessary in furtherance of the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)   Interpretation of Zoning Map. Where the street or lot layout actually
on the ground, or as officially recorded, differs from the street and lot lines
as shown on the Zoning Map, the Board shall have the power, after notice to the
owners of the properties involved and after a public hearing, to interpret the
Zoning Map in such a way as to carry out the intent and purposes of this Zoning
Ordinance for the particular location in questions.
   (d)   Administrative Review. The Board shall have the power to hear and
decide any matter in which it is alleged by the appellant that there is error
in any order, requirement, decision, grant or refusal made by the Zoning
Inspector in the enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13; Ord. 2019-04. Passed 4-2-19.)

make such order, requirement, decision or determination as deemed necessary.

   (a)   Boundaries. The boundaries of the districts established in Section
1264.01  are shown on the Village Zoning Map, a copy of which follows the text
of this Zoning Ordinance as Exhibit I. Said map and all notations, references
and other information shown thereon shall be as much a part of this Zoning

attested and is on file with the Fiscal Officer. Questions concerning the exact
location of district boundary lines shall be determined by the Zoning Inspector
with further appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals.

the boundaries of any of the aforesaid districts, as shown on the Zoning Map,
the following rules shall apply:
      (1)   Where boundaries approximately follow streets, alleys, or highways.
Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the center
line or street line of streets, the center line or alley lines of alleys, or
the centerline of right-of-way lines of highways, such lines shall be construed
to be such district boundaries.
      (2)   Where boundaries parallel street lines, alley lines or highway
right-of-ways. Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are
approximately parallel to the centerlines or street lines of streets, the
centerlines or alley lines of alleys, or the centerlines of right-of-way lines
of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel
thereto and at such distance there from as indicated on the map. If no distance
is given, such dimensions shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on
said Zoning Map.
      (3)   Where boundaries approximately follow lot lines. Where district
boundaries are indicated, as approximately following lot lines, such lot lines
shall be construed to be said boundaries.
      (4)   Vacation of public ways. Whenever any street or public walkway is
vacated by the Village Council, Zoning Districts adjoining each side of such
street or walkway shall automatically be extended to the center of the vacated
area, all of which shall thereafter be subject to all appropriate regulations
of the extended districts.
   (c)   Annexations. All territory hereafter annexed to the Village shall be
in the Residence “A” District unless provided otherwise by ordinance.

(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13; Ord. 2019-04. Passed 4-2-19.)
1270.07   LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING.
   The purpose of landscaping and screening is to soften the outline of
buildings; screen glare and reduce noise levels emanating from a site; and to
create a visual and/or physical barrier between conflicting, incompatible and/
or visually undesirable land uses. The installation of landscaping and
screening protects the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of
the Village through the reduction of noise, visual pollution, and headlight
glare.
   (a)   Applicability. Landscaping and screening shall be required as follows:
      (1)   All new commercial development on vacant lands;
      (2)   Additional buildings or building additions proposed for a site
currently developed with commercial uses; or
      (3)   Currently developed sites that are to be modified by changes in
use, vehicular circulation, or parking area design.
   (b)   Landscaping plan submission requirements. Any applicant proposing a
development listed in subsection (a) above, shall submit for review and
approval a landscaping and screening plan. Landscaping and screening plans
shall be prepared by a person knowledgeable in landscape design and
construction such as a professional nurseryman, a professional landscaper or a
landscape architect.
   (c)   Required landscaping and screening. The following minimum landscaping
and screening shall be provided:
      (1)   Landscaping along streets. A minimum ten-foot-wide applied
landscaping strip abutting all rights-of-way, broken only by points of
vehicular or pedestrian access, shall be provided with a minimum of one
deciduous tree having a caliper of not less than two inches and ten shrubs,
each having a height of not less than 36 inches per 35 lineal feet of frontage.
In lieu of the above, an elevated earth berm a maximum of three feet higher
than the finished elevation of the street centerline with one deciduous tree
having a caliper of not less than two inches and six shrubs each having a
height of not less than 36 inches per 35 lineal feet of frontage may be
provided as an alternative. Plantings or earthen berms or mounds along a public
or private street shall not block or interfere with sight distance at street/
drive intersections or corner lots, nor shall any such plantings or earthen
berms contribute to the additional accumulation of snow within the public way.
Landscaping materials used along streets and sidewalks shall not be fruit- or
nut-bearing, nor shall they have thorns or briars that interfere with
passersby. Areas outside of the required landscaping strip in front yards shall
be maintained either as lawns or additional landscaping beds.
      (2)   Landscaping along site perimeter when adjacent to another
commercial use. A minimum ten-foot-wide by 35-foot-long landscaping bed shall
be provided for every 70 lineal feet along the perimeter of the site, except
along streets. Each required landscaping bed shall be planted with one
deciduous tree having a caliper of not less than two inches, or two evergreen
trees having a height of not less than six feet, and three shrubs each having a
height of not less than 36 inches per required landscape bed. Between adjoining
uses, landscaping beds shall be coordinated in order to provide a continuous
landscaping strip along the perimeter. Where existing vegetation occurs along
the perimeter that satisfies the intent of this section and no development is
proposed within 50 feet of the lot line, a ten-foot-wide preservation strip may
be substituted. Perimeter planting along the site perimeter shall only be
required to the extent necessary to screen the activity areas and exterior
lighting of the commercial use from neighboring uses. For the purposes of this
section, the activity area of a commercial site shall include, but is not
limited to, all structures, access drives and on-site traffic lanes, parking
lots, loading areas and refuse areas. Areas outside of the required perimeter
landscaping strip in required side or rear yards shall be maintained either as
lawns or additional landscaping beds.
      (3)   Site perimeter landscaping when adjacent to residential zoning
district or an existing residential use. A minimum 15-foot-wide perimeter
landscaping strip shall be provided along the perimeter of the site that is
adjacent to the Residential Zoning District or existing residential use. Site
perimeter landscaping shall include, at a minimum, two deciduous trees having a
caliper of not less than two inches each, eight evergreen trees, each having a
height of not less than six feet, and 12 shrubs, each having a height of not
less than 36 inches per 35 lineal feet of perimeter landscaping required.
Plantings shall be staggered to form a dense screen within two years after
planting. Where existing vegetation occurs along the perimeter that satisfy the
intent of this section and no development is proposed within 50 feet of the lot
line, a 20-foot-wide preservation strip may be substituted. Areas outside the
required perimeter landscaping strip in required side or rear yards shall be
maintained either as lawns or additional landscaping beds.
      (4)   Interior parking lot landscaping. A planting island of at least 160
square feet in total pervious surface area shall be provided for each 12
parking spaces on the interior of a parking lot that accommodates 12 cars or
more. The island shall be placed at intervals of no more than 135 lineal feet
on center. A minimum of one deciduous tree having a caliper of not less than
two inches shall be planted per island, along with other ornamental shrubbery
and plantings. Where the island occurs parallel to parking spaces on each side,
the planting island shall be a minimum of nine feet in width. No fruit- or nut-
bearing trees or shrubs shall be planted in any planting island.
      (5)   Screening of loading areas, outside storage areas and other service
areas. Screening and landscaping shall prevent direct views of loading areas,
storage areas outside an enclosed building, service areas, and associated
service driveways from adjacent properties or from the public or private right-
of-way when viewed from ground level within 12 months after planting. Screening
shall consist of opaque ornamental fencing or walls, which are architecturally
compatible with the principal building on the lot, or a dense, staggered
evergreen planting consisting of a double row of evergreen trees, spaced a
minimum of 15 feet on center, of sufficient quantity and height, to screen the
above areas totally.
      (6)   Building façade landscaping. At least 75% of the area within ten
feet of the building façade shall be permanently landscaped. Landscaping
materials shall include a combination of trees, shrubbery, annual and perennial
flowers, and ground cover plantings. This area may be broken by entrance walks.
Trees shall be planted a minimum of 30 feet on center, with the planting of
shrubbery flowers and ground covers completing the design.
   (d)   Landscaping Materials and Standards. New development shall provide
landscaping and screening as provided in subsection (c), above. Walls and
fences, plants and mounds, as listed in subsections (1) through (3) below, are
suitable for screening use individually, or in combination with each other to
create a dense screen, subject to review and approval by the Planning
Commission.
      (1)   Walls and fences. Walls and fences used to fulfill screening
requirements shall be so detailed on the site plan. Walls and fences shall be
constructed of waterproof materials, including brick, pressure treated lumber,
redwood or cedar lumber, vinyl, and aluminum, stainless steel, brass, bronze,
or galvanized hardware. Except as specifically noted, chain link fences with or
without wooden or synthetic slat material shall not be allowed when used to
satisfy landscaping and screening requirements.
      (2)   Plants. All plants are to be living and hardy within the United
States Department of Agriculture's Hardiness Zone 6, Per Department of
Agriculture, effective January, 2012, and thriving in Medina County. Plant
materials used in conformance with the provisions of this section shall conform
to the standards of the American Association of Nurserymen and shall have
passed any inspection required under state regulations. Trees shall be balled
and burlapped or in containers. Shrubs, vines and ground covers can be planted
as bare root as well as balled and burlapped or in containers. All landscaping
materials shall be free of noxious weeds, disease and pests. Nursery stock
identification tags shall not be removed from any planting prior to inspection
and approval of final installation by the Zoning Inspector.
         A.   Deciduous trees. Deciduous trees shall have a minimum caliper of
at least two inches, conforming to acceptable nursery industry procedures at
the time of planting.
         B.   Evergreen trees. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of six feet
in height at the time of planting. Evergreen plantings shall be designed to
provide an effective, dense screen within two years of planting. White Pine
trees are not acceptable trees for screening/buffering purposes.
         C.   Shrubs and hedges. Shrubs and hedges shall be at least 36 inches
in height at the time of planting. All shrubs and hedges used for screening
shall be designed to provide an effective, dense screen and mature height of at
least six feet within four years after the date of the final approval of each
planting when used for perimeter landscaping or screening applications. The
height at installation of the planting shall be measured from the level of the
surface of the plant base at the edge closest to the screening.
         D.   Grass or ground cover. Grass of the fescue, bluegrass, or
perennial rye families shall be planted in species normally grown as lawns in
Medina County. In swales or other areas subject to erosion, solid sod, erosion
reducing net or suitable mulch shall be used and nurse grass seed shall be sown
for immediate protection until complete coverage is achieved. Grass sod shall
be clean and free of weeds and noxious pests or diseases. Ground cover shall be
planted in such a manner as to provide 75% complete coverage after two growing
seasons.
         E.   Existing material. The Planning Commission may approve the use of
existing plant material to comply with the landscaping and screening
requirements of this section. In reviewing such proposals, they shall consider
whether the existing material is capable of performing the landscaping or
screening functions required by this section, by reason of its size, density,
location, deciduous or evergreen foliage, and other characteristics. They shall
also consider the likelihood that the plant material will survive construction
related disruptions, including soil compaction and changes in grading and
drainage. Existing vegetation shall be preserved in accordance with acceptable
nursery industry procedures.
      (3)   Mounds. Mounds or berms may be used as physical barriers, which
block or screen a view. Differences in elevation between areas requiring
screening do not constitute a mound. Mounds shall conform to the following
standards:
         A.   The maximum side slope shall be four feet horizontal to one foot
vertical (4:1). The design shall be reviewed by the Zoning Inspector to ensure
that proper erosion prevention and control practices have been utilized and
that irrigation or other means are provided to ensure plant material will have
sufficient moisture for survival.
         B.   Mounds shall be designed with physical variations in height and
alignment throughout their length.
         C.   Landscape plant material installed on mounds shall be arranged in
an irregular pattern to accentuate the physical variation and achieve a natural
appearance.
         D.   The landscape plan shall show sufficient detail to demonstrate
compliance with the above provisions, including a plan and profile of the
mound, soil types and construction techniques.
         E.   Mounds shall be located and designed to minimize the disturbance
to existing trees located on the site or adjacent thereto.
         F.   No part of any mound shall be elevated more than 30 inches above
natural grade within ten feet of any right-of-way or property line.
         G.   Adequate ground cover or mulch shall be used and maintained to
prevent erosion.
      (4)   Maintenance. All landscaping materials shall be installed and
maintained according to accepted nursery industry procedures. The property
owner shall be responsible for continued, perpetual maintenance of all
landscaping materials, and shall keep them in a proper, neat and orderly
appearance, free from refuse, debris, and noxious and unsightly weeds at all
times. All unhealthy or dead plant material shall be replaced within one year,
or by the next planting period, whichever comes first. Violation of these
installation and maintenance provisions shall be grounds for the Zoning
Inspector to require replacement of the landscape material or institute legal
proceedings to enforce the provisions of this section.

(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13; Ord. 2019-04. Passed 4-2-19.)
1274.03   BASIS OF DETERMINATION.
   The Planning Commission shall establish that the general standards and the
specific standards pertinent to each use indicated herein shall be satisfied by
the completion and operation of the proposed development. The Planning
Commission may also impose such additional conditions and safeguards deemed
necessary for the general welfare, for the protection of individual property
rights, and for ensuring that the intent and objectives of this Code will be
observed.

(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13.)
1274.04   PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to recognize and
accommodate in a unified development, creative and imaginative residential and
ancillary development and to permit those innovations in the technology of land
development that are in the best interests of the Village. To accomplish this
purpose, it is the intent in establishing this subsection to achieve:
      (1)   A maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of
housing and living facilities, permitting an increased density per acre and
flexibility in yard and area requirements to allow for clustering of living
units.
      (2)   More functional patterns of open space and recreation areas.
      (3)   A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural
topography and geologic features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation and
prevents the disruption of natural drainage patterns.
      (4)   A more efficient use of the land than is generally achieved through
conventional development resulting in substantial savings through shorter
utilities and streets.
      (5)   A development pattern in harmony with land use density,
transportation facilities and the community facilities objectives adopted by
the Village. The Village is also prepared to accept a greater population
density in undeveloped areas than that reflected by present zoning, provided
the developer can demonstrate that any increment of public cost clearly
attributable to increase densities will be compensated for by the private
amenities and public benefits to be achieved by the plan of development.
   (b)   Special Provisions Governing Planned Residential Developments (PRDs).
Because of the special characteristics of Planned Residential Developments
(PRDs), special provisions governing the development of land for this purpose
are required. Whenever there is a conflict or difference between the provisions
of this section and those of other sections of this Code, the provisions of
this subsection shall prevail. Subjects not covered by this subsection shall be
governed by the respective provisions found elsewhere in this code. Except as
specifically noted, nothing in this section shall be interpreted to exempt
Planned Residential Developments (PRDs) from all provisions of the Subdivision
Regulations.
   (c)   Uses. Within a Planned Residential Development (PRD), all buildings,
structures or premises shall be used or designed to be used for the following
uses: compatible residential commercial, public, quasi-public and open space or

smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements and minimal hazards to
vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Minor streets within the Planned Residential
Development (PRD) shall be designed to discourage their use by through traffic.
      (4)   The pedestrian and bicycle system and their related walkways shall
be insulated as much as possible from vehicular movement.
   (g)   Parking Requirements. There shall be provided outside the public or
private right-of-way a minimum of two and one-half parking spaces for each
dwelling unit. These spaces shall be located in an enclosed garage. An area
designated for guest parking may be permitted as deemed appropriate by the
Planning Commission.
   (h)   Utility Requirements. Underground utilities, including telephone,
cable and electrical systems are required within the limits of all Planned
Residential Developments (PRDs).
   (i)   Erosion and Sedimentation Control. Erosion and sediment control plan
shall be reviewed and approved by the Village Engineer.
   (j)   Ancillary and Nonresidential Uses.
      (1)   The Planning Commission may approve ancillary uses provided the
location is appropriate for such use. The relationship of such uses to
adjoining circulation pattern and the relationship of such land uses to the
land use and development patterns adjoining the Planned Residential Development
(PRD) shall be evaluated.
      (2)   Nonresidential uses and buildings, when submitted to the Planning
Commission, shall be planned as groups having common parking areas and common
ingress and egress points to reduce the number of potential accident locations
at intersections and thoroughfares. Planting screens or fences shall be
provided at the perimeter of the nonresidential area. The plan of the project
shall provide for integrated and harmonious design of buildings and for
adequate and properly arranged facilities for internal vehicular and pedestrian
circulation, landscaping and such other features and facilities as may be
necessary to make the project attractive and efficient from the standpoint of
the adjoin and surrounding areas. All areas designed for future expansion or
not intended for immediate improvement or development shall be landscaped or
otherwise maintained in a neat orderly manner as specified by the Planning
Commission.
   (k)   Supplemental Requirements. A Planned Residential Development (PRD)
shall comply with the following supplemental requirements:
      (1)   Landscaping. All development, street right-of-ways and corridors,
and common open space shall be landscaped according to an overall plan and
shall be implemented by phases as units are completed and weather permits.
Plantings, walls, fencing, and screens shall be so designed and located as to
optimize privacy and aesthetic quality without encroaching upon required
automobile site distances. Natural wooded areas shall be preserved and
maintained for landscaping and screening to the greatest extent possible.
      (2)   Topography - natural features. The Planned Residential Development
(PRD) shall be designed to take advantage of the topography of the land in
order to utilize the natural contours, and to minimize destruction of
watercourses, natural vegetation, trees, and topsoil. The natural features and
other distinctive characteristics of the site shall be integrated into the plan
to create variations in the arrangements of buildings, open spaces and site
features. A program for preserving and quickly recreating an attractive
landscape environment shall be part of any development.
      (3)   Grading. Grading and site preparation for areas other than building
sites, streets, sidewalks and utilities shall be limited to disturbing the
minimum amount of vegetation and other topographic features.
      (4)   Development layout. Dwelling units shall be grouped or clustered so
as to break up the development arrangement, maximize privacy, collect and
maximize the common open space and promote the individual character and
coordinated layout of each lot, cluster and grouping. Streets and cul-de-sacs
shall be laid out so as to utilize natural contours and discourage through and
high speed traffic.
      (5)   Solid waste storage and disposal. All rubbish and garbage shall be
stored in wholly screened or fenced storage areas acceptable and regulated by
the Village.
      (6)   Phased development. If the development is to be implemented in
phases, each phase shall have adequate provision for access, parking, storm
water management and other public improvements to serve the development in
accordance with the applicable criteria set forth. Each phase shall be provided
with temporary or permanent transitional features, buffers, or protective areas
in order to prevent damage to completed phases, to future phases and to
adjoining property. A cash performance bond on all improvements and amenities
shall be furnished to the Village prior to initiating construction on the first
phase of the development.
      (7)   Compliance with other ordinances. In addition to complying with the
requirements of this chapter, an applicant applying for a zoning permit for the
development of a Planned Residential Development (PRD) shall comply with the
appropriate provisions of the Subdivision Regulations and other sections of the
Zoning Ordinance not in conflict with the specifications contained in these
regulations.
   (l)   Procedure for Approval of PRD.
      (1)   General procedure. In general, the procedure for approval requires
site plan review and approval of the development plan. The plan for streets and
improvements must comply with the Subdivision Regulations.
      (2)   Pre-application meeting. The developer shall meet with the Zoning
Inspector and the Planning Commission prior to the submission of the
preliminary development plan. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss early
and informally the purpose and effect of this Code and the criteria and
standards contained herein and to familiarize the developer with the Major
Thoroughfare Plan, the Parks and Public Open Space Plan, the Subdivision
Regulations and the drainage, sewer and water systems of the Village, if such
plans are in effect.
      (3)   The developer shall follow the guidelines for application for site
plan review and zoning permits.
      (4)   Criteria for decision by the Planning Commission. Before making its
decision, the Planning Commission shall consider the evidence submitted with
the application as presented, to determine that:
         A.   The proposed development can be completed within five years of
the date of approval.
         B.   Each individual unit of the development, as well as the total
development, can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an
environment of sustained desirability and stability or that adequate assurance
will be provided that such objective will be attained. The uses proposed will
not be detrimental to present and potential surrounding uses, but will have a
beneficial effect, which could not be achieved under standard district
regulations.
         C.   The streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate
to carry anticipated traffic and increased densities will not generate traffic
in such amounts as to overload the street network outside the Planned
Residential Development (PRD).
         D.   Any proposed nonresidential development can be justified at the
locations proposed.
         E.   Any exception from standard district requirements is warranted by
the design and other amenities incorporated in the development plan, in accord
with the Planned Residential Development (PRD) regulations and the adopted
policies of the Village Council.
         F.   The area surrounding said development can be planned and zoned in
coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development.
         G.   The Planned Residential Development (PRD) is in general
conformance with the comprehensive development plan.
         H.   The existing and proposed utility services are adequate for the
population densities and nonresidential uses proposed.
         I.   Significant buffer zones with adequate landscaping are provided
between the proposed development and adjacent residential areas.
         J.   The layout of parking areas, service areas, entrances, exits,
signs, lighting, sources of noise or other potentially adverse influences are
designed and located to protect the residential character of areas adjacent to
the planned development.
      (5)   Supplementary conditions and safeguards. In approving any Planned
Residential Development (PRD), the Planning Commission may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this code. Violations
of such conditions or safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the
Development Plan is approved, shall be deemed a violation of this code.
      (6)   Expiration and extension of approval period. The approval of a
development plan for a Planned Residential Development (PRD) district shall be
for a period not to exceed five years to allow for preparation and recording of
the required subdivision plat and the development of the project. If no
construction has begun within five years after approval is granted, the
approved final development plan shall be void and the land shall revert to the
district regulations in which it is located. An extension of the time limit or
modification of the approved development plan may be approved if the Planning
Commission finds that such extension or modification is not in conflict with
the public interest. No zoning amendment passed during the time period granted
for the approved final development plan shall in any way affect the terms under
which approval of the Planned Residential Development (PRD) was granted.
      (7)   Bond or escrow agreement. As a prerequisite to the issuance of a
conditional zoning certificate for a Planned Residential Development (PRD), the
applicant shall file with Council prior to the approval of any building or
construction plans a cash bond or construction escrow agreement to ensure the
construction of the project within the period specified on the conditional
zoning certificate or as extended or changed by the Planning Commission. The
cash bond or escrow shall be enforceable by or payable to the Village in a sum
at least equal to the estimated costs of all of the site improvements,
including but not limited to: streets, drives, walks, walls, storm and sanitary
sewers, open space improvements, recreation facilities, landscape planting,
ornamental features not on a building, and terraces, but not buildings, for the
entire project. The cash bond or escrow shall be in a form and with surety and
conditions approved by the Law Director. In the event of default under such
bonds or escrow, the Village may use the sum defaulted to construct such site
improvements to the extent of the funds available.

or within the site itself; and
      (4)   The construction of public or private off-street parking areas
where they are permitted under this Zoning Ordinance.
   (d)   Employment increases where such increase in employment requires
additional parking to be provided in order to remain in compliance with the
parking requirements of Section
1270.06.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13; Ord. 2019-04. Passed 4-2-19.)

   (d)   The application shall be accompanied by a fee as specified by the
Village's Schedule of Fees (
Exhibit V, Fee Schedule). Applications without fees will not be processed.
   (e)   A list of the name and addresses of all property owners within 200
feet of the property lines of the subject property, as they appear on the
County Auditor's current tax list or Treasurer's mailing list.
   (f)   Copies of current tax map pages for the subject and above properties.
   (g)   Project cost estimates.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13; Ord. 2019-04. Passed 4-2-19.)
1276.04   ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS.
   Once a complete application for Site Plan Review has been filed, the Zoning
Inspector shall:
   (a)   Circulate copies of the site plan to those officials and technicians
that would have information and knowledge pertinent to the project such as the
Planning Commission, Police Chief, Fire Chief, Village Engineer, Village
Sanitary Engineer, and such other individuals as necessary for review and
comment. After all of the comments are received, the Zoning Inspector shall
arrange for a meeting with the applicant if there are any negative comments to
discuss. Any necessary revisions should be made prior to the Planning
Commission meeting.
   (b)   The Zoning Inspector shall notify the identified property owners,
applicant and other interested parties by mail, no less than 15 working days
prior to the Planning Commission meeting, or Board of Zoning Appeals meeting
(if an applicant is contesting a decision of the Planning Commission), at which
the subject site plan will be considered. The notice shall indicate an
interested party may review a case file during normal business hours.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13; Ord. 2019-04. Passed 4-2-19.)
1276.05   SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   The Planning Commission shall conduct a Site Plan Review so that it may
determine that the specific requirements of this Zoning Ordinance are being
satisfied in the planning of the proposed project. The Commission may also take
into account comments from Village Council or the general public in its
evaluation of the project. The Commission may attach such reasonable conditions
to the approval of a site plan that if feels are necessary to ensure the
health, safety, and welfare of the general public and to maintain the integrity
of an existing neighborhood in proximity to the development.
   (a)   Special Studies Required. In the event the Planning Commission feels
that additional information is necessary in order to make its decision, it may
instruct the applicant to conduct additional studies. The Planning Commission
may have the Village Engineer review the Site Plan and engage other
professional disciplines as determined by the Planning Commission. The cost of
such reviews shall be paid by the applicant. A deposit may be required to
guarantee such payment.
   (b)   Decision. The Planning Commission shall approve or disapprove all site
plans to come before it within 60 days of the initial Site Plan Review meeting.
Such period may be extended by the Commission in the event that additional
studies are required.
      (1)   Disapproval. In the event that the Commission does not approve a
proposed site plan, the Commission shall notify the applicant in writing of its
decision. When a site plan is not approved, it may not be resubmitted to the
Commission unless correcting revisions have been made to the original plans.
All re-submittals shall follow the application requirements set forth in this
chapter.
      (2)   Approval. In the event that the Commission recommends the approval
of a proposed site plan, the Commission shall notify Village Council of its
recommendation in writing. The Chairperson of the Commission, or his or her
designee, shall sign and date a copy of the approved plans and this copy shall
become the officially approved site plan. Upon approval, the applicant shall
have one year from the date of approval to obtain a zoning permit. The zoning
permit shall be obtained in accordance with
Chapter 1260. Should this one-year period elapse without the applicant having
obtained the zoning permit, the Site Plan Approval shall become null and void.
Should this become the case, the applicant may resubmit the application in
conformance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (c)   Conformance with Site Plan Approval. The Planning Commission may
consider the revocation of a Site Plan Approval in the event that a proposed
development whose zoning permit has not yet been granted is found to be in
violation of the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance and/or the conditions
attached to the approval by the Commission. Should revocation be considered,
the Commission shall schedule a hearing in which to consider the revocation and
shall notify the original applicant and/or project representative of the date,
time and place of hearing at least 20 days in advance of the meeting by
certified mail. Any violation shall be treated as a violation to this Zoning
Ordinance and be subject to penalty as specified in Section
1260.15 .
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13; Ord. 2019-04. Passed 4-2-19.)
1276.06   STAGED DEVELOPMENT.
   Where a proposed site plan indicates a staged site development approach, the
later stages of the proposed development may be constructed within five years
of the initial approval providing that the initial stage is completed in
conformance with this Zoning Ordinance. Upon the expiration of this five-year
period, any and all development which has not commenced shall be subject to the
application and review requirements stated within this chapter and amendments
thereto.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13; Ord. 2019-04. Passed 4-2-19.)
1276.07   TECHNICAL PLAN REVIEW.
   In additional to the Site Plan Review process set forth within this chapter,
proposed project plans may also undergo a Technical Plan Review coordinated by
the Village Superintendent. In no way shall a Site Plan Review be construed as
a substitute or a waiver for the Technical Plan Review.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13.)
1276.08   FINANCIAL GUARANTEES.
   Prior to issuance of zoning or building permits, a cash performance bond or
other acceptable financial guarantee shall be placed on deposit with the
Village to ensure that site improvements, landscaping, surface drainage,
sidewalks, etc. are installed in conformance with the approved site plan. The
cash bond or guarantee shall be for the total construction cost estimate of the
site improvements plus 10% of the estimate, in lieu of increased costs, and
shall be for a period not to exceed two years, providing for the complete
construction of the site improvements within that period. If the development is
to be developed in stages, each stage shall have a separate financial
guarantee.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13.)
1276.09   DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   The design guidelines in the following sections are intended to encourage
creativity, imagination and skill in site and building design. Site plans shall
be prepared in accordance with, and review and action on site plans by the
Planning Commission and Village Council shall be based on, the design
guidelines listed in Sections
1276.10 through
1276.15 below. The design guidelines of this chapter are intended to supplement
the specific requirements of the applicable Zoning District, as well as the
Subdivision Regulations of the Village.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13.)
1276.10   RELATIONSHIP TO PLANS AND POLICIES.
   (a)   Plans. The site plan should reflect all adopted Village plans and
policies affecting the site.
   (b)   Purpose Statement. The Site Plan should be consistent with the purpose
statement for the Zoning District in which it is located.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13.)
1276.11   OPEN SPACE.
   See Section
1240.01, Definitions.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13.)
1276.12   BUILDING DESIGN AND CHARACTER.
   (a)   Privacy. As development intensities increase, greater opportunities
for privacy should be provided by utilizing fences or walls to enclose internal
views. Consideration shall be given in building design and location to the
privacy of occupants of adjacent buildings.
   (b)   Site Amenity. The primary living area of a dwelling or the primary
activity area of a building should be oriented toward a natural site amenity
where possible.
   (c)   Building Placement. Buildings should be placed in an orderly, non-
random fashion. Excessively long, unbroken building façades should be avoided.
   (d)   Context. New development and infill development should be viewed in
the context of a cluster, block, neighborhood, or the entire community.
Developments should be designed to be architecturally compatible with nearby
structures or to screen incompatible elements of nearby development.
   (e)   Compatible. Within the requirements of the applicable Zoning District,
the height, scale and setback of each building should be compatible with
existing or proposed adjoining buildings. Architectural style should not
necessarily duplicate adjoining structures, but should be compatible in overall
form, texture, color and rhythm. Compatibility can be enhanced by the use of
building materials and roof lines comparable to nearby development.
   (f)   Consistency. Consistency in architectural style should be provided
within a development or a fill-in area.
   (g)   Style. The architectural style should be carried out in as authentic
manner as possible.
   (h)   Variety. Variety can be provided within a particular architectural
style by subtly varying building form, setbacks, colors and materials.
   (i)   Off-Site Impacts. Building and landscape design should be used to
reduce adverse off-site visual impacts resulting from mechanical or service
areas.
   (j)   Bulk. The apparent bulk of a building may be lessened with the use of
façade articulation and pitched roofs.
   (k)   Service Areas. Service and storage areas, dumpsters, mechanical
equipment and other utility features shall be screened from view from the
street and neighboring properties using materials harmonious with the building.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13.)
1276.13   CIRCULATION.
   (a)   Street Network. Short loop streets, cul-de-sacs and residential
streets should be used for access to low-density residential land uses in order
to provide a safer living environment and a stronger sense of neighborhood
identity. Access to arterial streets should be limited, where possible, to
high-intensity land uses.
   (b)   Public Safety. On-site circulation shall be designed as to make
possible adequate Fire and Police protection.
   (c)   Street Alignment.
      (1)   Natural features. A combination tangent/curve street network should
be used to respect the existing natural features of a site, provide visual
interest and create a more practical alignment for efficient site planning of
building clusters.
      (2)   Grading. Horizontal and vertical alignment of streets should be
designed to minimize grading. This includes working with the existing grade
rather than against the grade to avoid excessive cut or fill. Particular effort
should be directed toward securing the flattest possible grade near
intersections.
   (d)   Pedestrian Circulation.
      (1)   Sidewalks shall be designed as networks, which provide safe
pedestrian connections between buildings and parking areas, recreation areas,
transit shelters, streets and other destinations. Walks shall be provided
between buildings and the street and between buildings and parking areas.
      (2)   Separation. Pedestrian and vehicular circulation should be
separated as much as possible, either through crosswalk/pavement markings,
signalization or complete grade separation.
      (3)   Widths. Walkways which provide access to parking, trash disposal
facilities, mailboxes, service areas and community facilities, should generally
be four feet in width. Common area paths designed to carry heavier pedestrian
traffic should generally be five to six feet in width in order to accommodate
two pedestrian lanes or one pedestrian lane and one bicycle lane.
      (4)   Crossings. Path and sidewalk crossings should be located where
there is good sight along the road. Street crossings should occur at
intersections.
      (5)   Parking. Off-street parking areas should be located within
convenient walking distance to the use being served. Handicapped parking should
be as near as possible to the structure to avoid crossing parking aisles.
   (e)   Parking Lots and Garages.
      (1)   Parking lot design. Parking areas shall contribute positively to
overall site design through the use of landscaping, decorative walls, berms and
other design features. Traffic islands should be provided to define circulation
paths and to break up the monotony of continuously paved areas.
      (2)   Access points. When locating points of ingress and egress,
consideration should be given to the location of existing access points,
adjacent to and directly across the street from the site. Curb cuts should be
shared by adjoining uses whenever possible.
      (3)   Drive-thru establishments. Drive-thru establishments, such as
banks, should be located to allow stacking space for peak hours of operation
and not restrict other parking lot circulation.
      (4)   Garages. Detached residential garages and carports should respect
the location of adjacent garages and driveways and should be architecturally
compatible with the principal structures on the site. When possible, garages
should be incorporated as a screening element in the overall site plan and used
to create private outdoor spaces and block objectionable views.
   (f)   Other Modes. In addition to the above, site design shall also consider
other transportation modes, including public transit and bicycles. Large retail
and other major destinations shall provide transit shelters. Bicycle parking
and racks shall be provided where appropriate.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13.)
1276.14   SIGNS.
   (a)   Scale. All signs, including wall, free-standing and window display,
should be an integral part of the overall building and site design, not as an
afterthought. All signs shall be of a complimentary scale and proportion in
design and in visual relationship to the site and its structures. Signs within
a development should be compatible with each other, and signs should not
compete for attention with signs on adjoining premises.
   (b)   Harmonious. The colors, materials and lighting of every sign should be
restrained, and harmonious with the building site to which it relates. Signs
should define or enhance architectural elements of the building, not obscure or
destroy them.
   (c)   Graphic Elements. The number of graphic elements on each sign should
be held to the minimum level needed to convey the sign's major message. The
graphic elements should reflect simplicity, neatness and minimum wording to
avoid visual clutter and to improve legibility. Signs should identify the name
and type of establishment and not advertise products or brand names.
   (d)   Coordination. Signage on each building should be coordinated and
consolidated.
   (e)   All signs shall also comply with the applicable provisions of
Chapter 1280.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13.)
1276.15   CLIMATE CONSIDERATIONS/ENERGY CONSERVATION.
   (a)   Heating Periods. Consideration should be given to both over and under
heated periods of the year when determining building locations. Desirable slope
exposure is south, southeast.
   (b)   Winter and Summer Sun. To maximize the effect of solar radiation in
winter months and maximize shade in the summer months:
      (1)   Deciduous trees should be used for summer shade and winter warmth;
      (2)   Active living spaces should be oriented to the south for winter
warmth; and
      (3)   Building overhangs should be designed to shield the high summer sun
and expose the area to the lower winter sun.
   (c)   Winter and Summer Wind. To reduce the impact of winter winds but
maximize summer breezes:
      (1)   Steeply pitched roofs should be used on the windward side to
deflect wind and reduce the roof area effected by the winds;
      (2)   Blank walls, garages or storage uses should be used on north
exposures;
      (3)   North entrances should be protected with earth mounds, evergreens,
and walls and fences; and
      (4)   Natural ventilation with prevailing summer breezes should be
allowed for whenever possible.

public health, safety and general welfare by providing for the regulation of
the use, location and size of signs within the Village. This section is
intended to provide for: the protection of property values; to maintain and
enhance the Village's natural and man-made environment; to encourage an
attractive and healthy economic environment; to minimize the confusion,
unsightliness, and self-defeating consequences of the use of an excessive
number of signs or signs of excessive size; and, to enable the fair and
consistent enforcement of these sign regulations. It is further intended to
reduce sign or advertising distractions and obstructions that may contribute to
traffic accidents.
   (b)   Objectives. It is further the purpose of this chapter to achieve the
following signage objectives:
      (1)   To promote clarity and effectiveness in sign communications, by
encouraging signs of high quality graphic design that are visible, legible and
readable in the circumstances in which they are seen; and
      (2)   To ensure among businesses an equitable distribution of the right
to identify a place or activity with a visible on-premises sign by preventing
signs which block other signs and cause confusing visual clutter.
      (3)   To protect the general public from damage and injury caused by the
distractions, hazards and obstructions caused by signs of excessive size or
number.
      (4)   To preserve the value of property by assuring the compatibility of
signs with surrounding land uses.
   (c)   Findings. The purposes and objectives stated above are based on the
following findings concerning signs:
      (1)   That businesses and other institutions located along public and
private streets have a need to identify themselves and their activities to
motorists and pedestrians by means of signs; and
      (2)   That excessive signs, with respect to size and number, create
dangerous traffic conditions, intrude on motorist and pedestrian enjoyment of
the natural and man-made beauty of the Village, and as such, are detrimental to
the public health, safety and general welfare of the Village.

1280.04   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   The following regulations shall apply to all signs in the Village:
   (a)   No sign shall be erected unless it is in compliance with the
regulations of this section and the County Building Code.
   (b)   No sign shall obstruct or interfere with traffic or traffic
visibility, or resemble or imitate signs or signals erected by the Village or
other governmental agency for the regulation of traffic or parking.
   (c)   No sign, whether free-standing, ground, mounted or attached to a
building or other structure, may project over any public street, sidewalk or
other public right-of-way, except as expressly permitted in this section.
   (d)   Any sign in excess of 32 square feet, which is permanently mounted,
shall bear, in a prominent position, a clearly legible identification plate
stating the name and address of the owner of the sign and the person, firm or
corporation responsible for its construction and the date of erection.
   (e)   No sign shall be permitted as the principal use on any premises.
   (f)   No sign shall contain any pictures or written language that is
indecent or pictures that are not in keeping with community standards.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13.)
1280.05   SIGN MEASUREMENT STANDARDS.
   The area of a sign shall be determined as follows:
   (a)   Free-standing. The area of a free-standing sign includes all
lettering, wording and accompanying designs and symbols, together with the
background, whether open or enclosed, on which they are displayed, but does not
include any supporting framework, bracing or other structure incidental to the
display. When a sign has two identical sides, back-to-back, the area shall be
calculated for one side only. When a sign has more than two sides, the total
area of all sides of the sign shall not exceed twice the maximum area for a
two-sided sign.
   (b)   Wall Signs and Awning Signs. For a wall sign, the sign area is
considered to include all lettering, wording, accompanying designs or symbols
and background material, but does not include any supporting framework and
bracing which are incidental to the display. Where the sign consists of
individual letters or symbols attached to, or painted on, a building surface,
awning, canopy, marquee or window, the area shall be considered to be only the
rectangular area of the letters or symbols.
   (c)   Maximum Area. For wall signs, the maximum area is based on the
horizontal width of the wall on which the sign is attached.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13.)
1280.06   GENERAL DESIGN CRITERIA.
   A sign, as permitted in various Zoning Districts in the Village, and as
described in the Schedules 1280.07.A and 1280.07.C, Basic Design and Regulatory
Elements, shall be designed, constructed and maintained to conform to the
purposes and objectives of this chapter, as well as the following general
design criteria:
   (a)   Items of Information. Permanent signs intended for viewing from a
street shall not contain more than eight items of information, except as herein
provided. Where a sign has more than one side, the maximum number of items
shall apply to each side. This provision does not apply to temporary signs or
to letters less than three inches in height. The maximum number of items of
information is further regulated by Section
1280.12.
   (b)   Flashing Light and Movement. No sign shall have animation, moving
parts, flashing lights or changing colors, except part of a sign, which by
means of changes in copy or moving parts, indicates time or temperature. Signs
may be illuminated by either external or internal sources of light. However, no
illuminated sign shall be permitted where any part of such sign flashes on or
off or displays changing degrees of intensity. This regulation applies to signs
located outside buildings, and to window signs inside buildings which can be
observed from the outside.
   (c)   Visibility at Intersections. No temporary or permanent sign over three
and three-quarter feet in height shall be erected or maintained within 50 feet
of an intersection, as measured from the point of intersection of the right-of-
way lines.
   (d)   Horizontal Dimensions. Required setbacks from property or right-of-way
lines shall be the horizontal distance between the sign structure and the
property or right-of-way line. No portion of the sign shall extend across a
right-of-way or property line.
   (e)   Number of Signs. Except as otherwise permitted in this section, any
activity or group of activities on a unified site may display one free-standing
sign, regardless of the number of activities on the site or parcel. A single
use on a large parcel may have more than one free- standing sign if the site
has frontage on more than one dedicated right-of-way, and if the signs are at
least 500 feet apart, measure directly from sign to sign.
   (f)   Compatibility and Continuity. The design and placement of signs should
be complementary to and compatible with the architecture of the building or
buildings on the site which it is placed, as well as adjacent buildings and
sites. Signs should also have a continuity of design, which means the font
type, size and color; background sign color; and materials used should be
consistent and harmonious to other signs on the site and surrounding sites.

1280.14   NON-CONFORMING SIGNS.
   (a)   Generally. In addition to providing specific standards for every new
sign, this section is intended to cause every sign in violation of any
provision of this section to eventually be removed, altered or replaced so as
to conform to this section. This section shall be used in the regulation of
non- conforming signs in addition to the requirements for non-conformities in
Section
1272.02 .
   (b)   Authority to Continue Existing Non-conformities. A permanent sign
which is non- conforming, which was erected pursuant to a Village zoning
permit, which was in place on the effective date of this section and which
remains or becomes non-conforming upon the adoption of this section, or any
subsequent amendment thereto, may be continued only in accordance with the
following regulations:
      (1)    Repairs. Ordinary repairs and nonstructural alterations may be
made to a non-conforming sign. No structural alteration shall be made in, to or
upon such non-conforming sign, except those required by law to make the sign
conform to this section.
      (2)   Additions and enlargements. A nonconforming sign shall not be added
to or enlarged in any manner, except to make the sign conform to this section.
      (3)   Moving. A non-conforming sign shall not be moved in whole or in
part to any other location unless such sign and the use thereof is made to
conform to this section.
      (4)   Restoration of damaged signs. A non-conforming sign, which is
destroyed or damaged by fire or other cause to the extent that the cost of
restoration thereof exceeds 50% of the replacement cost of such sign, shall not
be restored unless it is made to conform to this section. If such damage or
destruction is less than 50% of the replacement cost, no repair or construction
shall be done unless restoration is started within six months from the date of
the partial destruction and is diligently pursued to completion.
      (5)   Discontinuance of use. A non-conforming sign, the use of which is
discontinued for 30 days, shall thereafter conform to this section.
      (6)   Change of use. Where a business use or identity associated with a
non- conforming sign at the time of the adoption of this section thereafter
terminates or changes, such termination or change of use shall require
termination of the non-conforming sign, and such sign shall thereafter conform
to this section.
(Ord. 2013-01. Passed 2-5-13; Ord. 2019-04. Passed 4-2-19.)
1280.15   ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Zoning Permit Required. Except as otherwise provided in this Zoning
Code, no person shall erect, construct, enlarge, move or convert a sign in the
Village without first obtaining a zoning permit for such sign from the Zoning
Inspector. A fee, as established by the Village Council, shall accompany an
application for such zoning permit.
   (b)   Zoning Permit Exceptions. The actions in subsections (b)(1) through
(3) below do not require a zoning permit for an existing conforming sign.
Requirements for changes to non-conforming signs are set forth in Section
1280.14 .
      (1)   Changing of the advertising copy or message on an existing
changeable copy sign or a similar approved sign, whether illuminated or non-
illuminated;
      (2)   Painting, repainting, cleaning or other normal maintenance and
repair of a sign not involving structural changes; and
      (3)   Any other operation which does not modify the sign or sign
structure for any existing conforming sign.
   (c)   Planning Commission Review. The Planning Commission shall review, as
part of a Site Plan Review, all signs proposed for the site.
   (d)   Maintenance. Every sign in the Village, including signs for which a
zoning permit is not required, shall be maintained in good structural condition
at all times. The Zoning Inspector shall inspect and have the authority to
order the repair, alteration or removal of signs which become dilapidated.
   (e)   Dangerous Signs. The Village may declare a sign unlawful and order its
removal if it endangers public safety by reasons of inadequate maintenance,
dilapidation or abandonment. Any such declaration shall state the reasons of
the Village for stating that the sign constitutes a safety hazard to the
general public.
   (f)   Removal by the Village. In emergency cases, the Village may instigate
the immediate removal of a dangerous or defective sign without notice. The cost
of removal of the sign by the Village shall be considered a debt owed to the
Village by the owner of the sign and the owner of the property and may be
recovered in an appropriate court action by the Village or by assessment
against the property. The cost of removal shall include any incidental expense
incurred by the Village in connection with the sign removal.
   (g)   Abandoned Signs. Except as otherwise provided in this Zoning
Ordinance, a sign which is located on property which becomes vacant and
unoccupied for a period of two months or more, or a sign which pertains to a
time, event or purpose which no longer applies, shall be deemed to have been
abandoned and must be removed. All abandoned signs are prohibited and shall be
removed by the owners of the signs or the owners of the premises at such
owner's expense.
   (h)   Building Code Review. All signs shall be subject to the applicable
requirements of the Ohio Building Code. In case of a conflict between any
provision of this section and a provision of such Code, the more restrictive
requirement shall apply.
   (i)   Violations. In case any sign is erected or maintained in violation of
this section, the Zoning Inspector shall notify, in writing, the owner or
lessee of the property on which said sign is located to alter the sign so as to
comply with this Code. Failure to comply with the written order of the Zoning
Inspector shall be punishable as stated in Section
1260.15.

APPENDIX A
MANHOLE VACUUM TESTING
A vacuum test shall be performed upon all newly installed manholes. Testing
shall be performed after installation of the top precast manhole section and
prior to installation of the manhole frame or any precast adjusting rings.
All pipes entering the manhole shall be closed with airtight bulkheads or plugs
and the top opening of the manhole shall be closed with a suitable airtight
test head. Air shall be withdrawn from the manhole by means of a vacuum pump
until a vacuum of ten (10) inches of mercury exists within the manhole. The
vacuum line shall be valve closed and the time shall be measured for the vacuum
in the manhole to drop from ten (10) to nine (9) inches of mercury.
The permissible time for the specified vacuum drop shall be greater than 1.77
seconds per foot of manhole depth for forty-eight (48) inch diameter manholes,
2.30 seconds per foot of manhole depth for sixty (60) inch diameter manholes
and 2.84 seconds per foot of manhole depth for seventy-two (72) inch diameter
manholes. If any manhole test discloses a time less than required, the
contractor shall locate and repair the cause of the leakage until the test time
falls within the permissible allowance.
The contractor shall supply all necessary apparatus for performing the required
vacuum testing and shall conduct the testing in the presence of a Village of
Westfield Center authorized representative.
APPENDIX B
SANITARY SEWER LEAKAGE TESTING
A low pressure air test shall be performed upon all newly installed sanitary
sewers. Testing shall not be performed until all laterals required on the line
to be tested have been installed.
The ends of the sewer section to be tested shall be closed at the upstream and
downstream manholes with airtight bulkheads or plugs. Air shall be added to the
sewer by means of an air pump until a pressure of approximately four (4) pounds
per square inch greater than the external water pressure exists within the
sewer. The air line shall be valved closed and the pressure shall be allowed to
stabilize for a period of at least two (2) minutes. After the stabilization
period, the pressure in the line shall be reduced to 3.5 pounds per square inch
greater than the external water pressure and the time shall be measured for the
pressure in the sewer to drop from 3.5 to 2.5 pounds per square inch greater
than the external water pressure.
The permissible time for the specified pressure drop shall be greater than the
sum of the times for the various pipe sizes and lengths in the section being
tested as determined by the following table:
   MINIMUM TEST TIME FOR VARIOUS PIPE SIZES
Nominal Pipe  Time         Nominal Pipe  Time
Size (Inches) Sec./100 Ft. Size (Inches) Sec./100 Ft.
Nominal Pipe  Time         Nominal Pipe  Time
Size (Inches) Sec./100 Ft. Size (Inches) Sec./100 Ft.
6             40           24            214
8             71           27            250
10            89           30            286
12            107          33            323
15            125          36            361
18            144          42            436
21            178          48            513
 
If any sewer test discloses a time less than required, the contractor shall
locate and repair the cause of the leakage until the test time falls within the
permissible allowance.
The contractor shall supply all necessary apparatus for performing the required
low pressure air testing and shall conduct the testing in the presence of a
Village of Westfield Center authorized representative.
APPENDIX C
SANITARY SEWER DEFLECTION TESTING
Deflection testing shall be performed on all newly installed sanitary sewers.
Testing shall not be performed during the first thirty (30) days after the
final backfill has been placed. Deflection testing shall be performed with
electronic equipment specifically designed for sewer deflection testing and
which will measure and continuously record both the location and pipe
deflection. This equipment shall be approved by the engineer prior to use. The
deflection sensing device shall be pulled through the sewer segment under test
at a rate of speed not exceeding thirty (30) feet per minute.
The permissible deflection shall not exceed five (5) percent of the original
inside diameter of the sewer. If any piping test discloses deflection greater
than this amount, the contractor shall locate and repair the cause of the over
deflection until the deflection, after a thirty (30) day period, falls within
the permissible deflection.
The contractor shall supply all necessary apparatus for performing the required
deflection testing and shall conduct the testing in the presence of a Village
of Westfield Center authorized representative.
APPENDIX D
VISUAL INSPECTION
Visual inspection shall be performed upon all newly installed sanitary sewers.
Inspection shall be performed after successful deflection testing by continuous
closed circuit televising and video taping of the interior of sewer pipe
between consecutive manholes. Inspection shall be performed by a qualified firm
approved by the Village of Westfield Center.
Televising and videoing shall provide a clear and visible picture of the full
interior diameter of the pipe. Video shall provide proper identification and
the location of the sewers taped including a log showing the exact position of
the television camera between manholes. Two (2) copies of the video shall be
furnished to the Village of Westfield Center for review upon completion of the
visual inspection.
The contractor shall supply all necessary equipment and apparatus for
performing the visual inspection and the inspection shall be performed in the
presence of a Village of Westfield Center authorized representative. Any
defects such as cracked pipe, sags, joint leakage, etc. discovered as a result
of the visual inspection shall be repaired to the satisfaction of the Village
of Westfield Center and the repaired area shall be re-inspected after thirty
(30) days.
APPENDIX E
BACKFLOW PREVENTION
There shall be no connection between the distribution system and any pipes,
pumps, hydrants or tanks whereby unsafe water or other contaminating materials
may be discharged or drawn into the system.
Individual water systems are prohibited from being interconnected to public
water supply systems unless appropriate backflow prevention devices are used
and plan approval is obtained from the Ohio EPA, Division of Public Water
Supply and the Village of Westfield Center.
APPENDIX F
SANITARY PRESSURE PIPE LEAKAGE TESTING
A hydrostatic leakage test shall be performed upon all newly installed PVC
plastic pressure sewer piping. Testing shall not be performed until all
laterals required on the line to be tested have been installed from the main
pressure sewer to and including the curb stop. Testing shall be continuous
through construction and at no time during construction shall there be more
than 1,500 feet untested.
Hydrostatic testing shall be performed at a test pressure of sixty-five (65)
pounds per square inch at the lowest point of the piping under test. Prior to
applying the test pressure, the piping under test shall be fully completed, the
piping shall be filled with water and all air shall be expelled from the
piping. The piping shall be brought up to test pressure by means of a pump
taking suction from a container from which volume of water added to the pipe
can be determined. The test pressure shall be maintained for a period of two
(2) hours through continuous pump operation. The quantity of water required to
maintain the test pressure shall be accurately determined for the two (2) hour
period and this quantity shall be multiplied by twelve (12) to obtain the
leakage per twenty-four (24) hours.
The permissible leakage shall not exceed a rate of ten (10) gallons per twenty-
four (24) hours per mile of pipe per inch of pipe diameter at the specified
test pressure. If any piping test discloses leakage greater than this amount,
the contractor shall locate and repair the cause of the leakage until the
leakage falls within the permissible allowance. All visible leaks regardless of
the amount shall be repaired.
The contractor shall supply the pump, pipe, connections all other necessary
apparatus for performing the required hydrostatic leakage testing and shall
conduct the testing in the presence of a Village of Westfield Center authorized
representative.
The contract shall clean up the site and leave the same in a neat and clean
condition at least equal in appearance to that which existed prior to the star
of the work. All surplus material, refuse and debris shall be removed from the
site and properly disposed of to the satisfaction of the engineer.
