to affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provision prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or

continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:

reason that the preservation of the safety and welfare of the citizens of

Municipality, enforce law and order and avoid practical and legal
entanglements. Upon its passage, this Ordinance shall become and be in effect

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

thirty (30) days nor more than seventy five (75) days after the date of such
delivery.

in office. If a majority of the votes cast shall be voted negatively, such
officer shall be considered removed, said office shall be deemed vacant, and
such vacancy shall be filled as provided in this Charter. The officer removed

CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio Legislature, through inaction, has elected
to observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.
   There are no sections in Chapter
204. This chapter has been established to provide a place for cross references
and any future legislation.

   Rule 1. The Mayor, or in his or her absence, the Deputy Mayor, shall take
the Chair at the hour appointed for Council to meet and shall immediately call
the members to order. The roll shall then be called and the Clerk of Council
shall enter in the minutes of each meeting the names of the members present
thereat. In the absence of a quorum at the time appointed for a meeting, the
members present may, by a majority vote, take a recess and cause the Clerk or
any police officer to procure the attendance of absent members. For purposes of
conducting Council meetings, a quorum shall require the presence of a minimum
of four members of Council.
   Rule 2. In the case of the absence of the Mayor and the Deputy Mayor, the
Clerk shall call Council to order. After the roll is called and a quorum is
found to be present, Council shall proceed to elect, by a majority vote, a
Chairperson of the meeting, or until the appearance of the Mayor or Deputy
Mayor.
   Rule 3. The Chair shall preserve decorum and shall decide all questions of
order, subject to appeal to Council. If an appeal is taken, the question shall
be: "Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the decision of Council?" If any
member transgresses the rules of Council, the Chair shall, or any member may,
call him or her to order, in which case he or she shall take his or her seat,
unless permitted to explain.
   Rule 4. All votes of Council shall be conducted by roll call.
   Rule 5. Either the Mayor, the Deputy Mayor or the Chairperson of the meeting
may call any other member to take his or her place in the Chair. Such
substitution shall not continue beyond the adjournment of such meeting. "The
Chair," as applied to the person presiding, means either the Mayor, the Deputy
Mayor or the Chairperson of the meeting.
   Rule 6. All members shall occupy seats in the Council Chamber as designated
by the Mayor. Members may exchange desks by joining in a written notice to the
Mayor to that effect.
   Rule 7. Every member, when about to speak to a question or make a motion,
shall address the Chair as "Mr. or Ms. Mayor," who shall announce the name of
the member entitled to the floor. The speaker shall confine himself or herself
to the question under debate and shall avoid personalities.
   Rule 8. No member shall speak more than five minutes on any one subject
without leave of Council.
   Rule 9. Every member present when a question is put, shall vote either "yes"
or "no," unless Council, for special reasons, excuses him or her. An
application to be excused from voting shall be made before the call of votes is
commenced. The reason for the request shall be briefly stated and it shall be
decided without debate.
   Rule 10. Any member may demand the division of a question under
consideration when its sense will admit such a division.
   Rule 11. All petitions, resolutions and ordinances may be referred by
Council to the appropriate committee for an investigation and report.
   Rule 12. Any member may dissent from or protest against any ordinance or
resolution of Council and have the reason therefor entered upon the Journal.
Such dissent must be in writing, couched in respectful language, and shall be

236.04 APPORTIONING UNDIVIDED LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE ASSISTANCE FUNDS.
   (a)   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5747.63, Council hereby finds and determines
that it is necessary, proper and in the best interest of the Municipality to
approve the alternative method of apportioning the 1990 and subsequent years'
local government revenue assistance funds of the County as set forth in
subsection (b) hereof, and Council further finds and determines that this
alternative method of apportionment is a proper and a fair apportionment of the
1990 and subsequent years' undivided local government revenue assistance funds
of the County.
   (b)   Pursuant to and in accordance with Ohio R.C. 5747.63, the following
alternative method of apportionment for the 1990 and subsequent years'
undivided local government revenue assistance funds of the County is hereby
approved.
      (1)   As used in this section:
         A.   "Area" means, with respect to a city or village, that portion of
the city or village located within the County, and with respect to a township,
means the unincorporated portion of the township, and with respect to the
County, means the jurisdictional limits of the County.
         B.   "City subdivision class" means all the participating cities
located wholly or partly within the County, excluding the City of Dayton.
         C.   "City weight" means the sum of the WPV units for the members of
the city subdivision class.
         D.   "Commission" means the Montgomery County Budget Commission.
         E.   "Fund" means an undivided local government revenue assistance
fund of the County.
         F.   "Fund estimate" means the estimate of the fund for the ensuing
calendar year made annually by the State Tax Commissioner pursuant to Ohio R.C.
5747.61(C).
         G.   "Residual fund" means the amount of the fund estimate remaining
after subtracting the allocations made hereunder to the County, the City of
Dayton and participating park districts.
         H.   "Smallest townships" means the four members of the township
subdivision class which rank the lowest when the members of the township
subdivision class are ranked in descending order of their population, provided,
however, that until the first population estimate is obtained, the smallest
townships shall be the Townships of Clay, German, Jackson and Perry.
         I.   "Subdivision" has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 5747.01(Q)(1).
         J.   "Total weight" means the sum of the city weight, the township
weight and the village weight.
         K.   "Township subdivision class" means all the participating
townships located within the County.
         L.   "Township weight" means the sum of the WPV units for the members
of the township subdivision class.
         M.   "Village subdivision class" means all the participating villages
located wholly or partly within the County.
         N.   "Village weight" means the sum of the WPV units for the members
of the village subdivision class.
         O.   "WPV unit," in the case of a city or village, means the product
of 1.0 and its population, and in the case of a township means the product of
.75 and its population.
      (2)   The Commission shall allocate the amount of the 1991 and future
funds to each participating subdivision for current operating expenses in
accordance with paragraphs (b)(3) through (b)(12) hereof.
      (3)   The Commission shall allocate to the County an amount equal to
37.38 percent of the fund estimate.
      (4)   The Commission shall allocate to the City of Dayton an amount equal
to 33.10 percent of the fund estimate.
      (5)   The Commission shall allocate to participating park districts
located wholly or partially within the County an amount equal to .74 percent of
the fund estimate, which shall be divided into parts of .72086 percent and
.01914 percent for the Montgomery County Park District and the Centerville-
Washington Township Park District, respectively, as long as the participating
subdivisions include only those two park districts. If more park districts are
included as participating subdivisions, the aggregate percentage allocation of
the fund estimate to participating park districts shall not change, and .74
percent of the fund estimate shall be divided among them by the Commission in
proportion to their relative need for funding to meet current operating
expenses in the ensuing calendar year as determined in the Commission's
reasonable discretion, but neither the Centerville-Washington Township Park
District nor any new park district shall receive an allocation of more than
.01914 percent of the fund estimate.
      (6)   The Commission shall allocate an aggregate amount equal to 34.68721
percent of the residual fund to the township subdivision class which amount
shall be allocated among its members as follows:
          A.   A preliminary allocation shall be made among the members of the
township subdivision class per capita. This preliminary allocation, with any
adjustments required by paragraph (b)(6)B. hereof, shall be the allocation to
each member or the township subdivision class.
         B.   For the four largest townships, the initial allocation shall be
reduced by 5.0 percent. The preliminary allocation less this 5.0 percent
reduction shall be the allocation to the four largest townships. The sum of the
5.0 percent reductions in the initial allocation for each of the four largest
townships shall be reallocated in equal twenty-five percent shares to the four
smallest townships. The preliminary allocation, plus an equal twenty-five
percent share of the amount reallocated from the four largest townships under
this paragraph, shall be the allocation of each of the smallest townships.
      (7)   The Commission shall allocate an aggregate amount equal to 3.90501
percent of the residual fund to the village subdivision class, which amount
shall be allocated among its members per capita.
      (8)   The Commission shall allocate an aggregate amount equal to 61.40778
percent of the residual fund to the City subdivision class, which amount shall
be allocated among its members per capita.
      (9)   The allocation described in paragraphs (b)(3) through (b)(8) hereof
are subject to the limitation that the allocation of the County shall not
exceed the maximum percentage limitation set forth in Ohio R.C. Chapter 5747,
and any amount computed under paragraph (b)(3) hereof which exceeds that
statutory maximum shall be added to the residual fund.
      (10)   Once the Commission has made its allocation of the fund estimate,
the allocation of each participating subdivision shall be divided by the amount
of the estimated fund to determine the percentage share of the fund for the
ensuing calendar year to which each is entitled, and the Commission shall cause
the County Auditor to certify to the Tax Commissioner the percentage share of
the County. No payment shall be made from the fund except in accordance with
the percentage shares computed in accordance with this paragraph.
      (11)   The percentage allocations of the residual fund specified in
paragraphs (b)(6), (7) and (8) hereof shall be effective only until receipt of
the first population estimate. The Board of County Commissioners shall obtain
an updated population estimate in each even-numbered year commencing in 1990,
which shall be provided to the Commission for its use in making calculations
hereunder. Upon receipt of a population estimate, the Commission shall first
recalculate the WPV units for each political subdivision, except the City of
Dayton, and shall then compute revised percentage allocations as follows: the
percentage allocation to the township subdivision class under paragraph (b)(6)
hereof shall be revised to equal 100 times the quotient obtained when township
weight is divided by total weight; the percentage allocation to the village
subdivision class under paragraph (b)(7) hereof shall be revised to equal, 100
times the quotient obtained when the village weight is divided by total weight;
and the percentage allocation to the city subdivision class under paragraph (b)
(8) hereof shall be revised to equal 100 times the quotient obtained when the
city weight is divided by total weight. All such revised percentage allocations
shall remain in effect and shall govern the fund estimates for the two calendar
years following receipt of the population estimate upon which the revised
percentage allocations are based.
      (12)   If, by incorporation or otherwise, the subdivision class to which
a political subdivision belongs changes, it shall continue to share in the fund
as if the change in subdivision class had not occurred until the first
allocation following the change in subdivision class, at which time the changed
political subdivision shall be treated as any member of its new subdivision
class.
      (13)   The alternative method of apportionment set forth above in this
subsection may be amended, revised or repealed only by resolutions of the Board
of County Commissioners, the Commission of the City of Dayton, and a majority
of the legislative authorities of all other political subdivisions then located
wholly or partially within the County.
   (c)   Council hereby requests, upon the approval of the alternative method
of apportionment of the 1990 and subsequent years' local government revenue
assistance funds of the County set forth in subsection (b) hereof by the Board
of County Commissioners, the Dayton City Commission, and a majority of the
boards of township trustees and legislative authorities of municipal
corporations located wholly or partly within the County, excluding the Dayton
City Commission, that the Montgomery County Budget Commission provide for the
alternative method of apportionment of the 1990 and subsequent years' undivided
local government revenue assistance funds of the County set forth in subsection
(b) hereof.
(Res. 13-89. Passed 11-27-89.)
236.05 DISTRIBUTION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT FUND AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE
ASSISTANCE FUND MONIES BY ALTERNATE FORMULA METHOD.
   The formula described herein is hereby approved for 1996 and thereafter,
until amended.
   (a)   The Warren County Park District will receive four percent of the total
Local Government Fund and the Local Government Revenue Assistance Fund.
   (b)   Warren County will receive 44.8 percent of the Local Government Fund
and the Local Government Revenue Assistance Fund.
   (c)   Of the remaining monies, the formula herein adopted divides the Local
Government Fund and the Local Government Revenue Assistance Fund as follows:
      (1)   12.5 percent of the aforesaid funds shall be distributed based upon
population figures contained in the 1990 census.
      (2)   12.5 percent of the aforesaid funds shall be distributed based upon
the assessed values for real and tangible property tax for the last known year.
      (3)   Seventy-five percent of the aforesaid funds shall be distributed
based upon the delivery of service for the purpose of maintaining streets,
parks, police, building and zoning, planning and engineering, courts and fire
and ambulance protection, and then dividing the aforesaid sum for each by the
total of all to determine the relative factors for each subdivision. These
figures are compiled from the actual expenses set forth in the budget most
recently submitted to the Warren County Auditor or the most recent financial
report.
      (4)   For subdivisions partially in Warren County, the service delivery
costs allocation shall be determined by the following formula:
         A.   Valuation in Warren County divided by the total valuation of the
subdivision.
         B.   Population in Warren County divided by the total population of
the subdivision.
         C.   Add the valuation factor to the population factor and divide by
two to equal the factor to be applied to the subdivision's service delivery
costs to determine service delivery in Warren County.
      (5)   No subdivision shall receive less than five thousand dollars
($5,000).
      (6)   No subdivision shall suffer a decrease of the lesser of fifteen
thousand dollars ($15,000) or fifteen percent of its previous year's
allocation.
      (7)   Funds of Warren County's share of the allocation will be utilized,
if needed, to offset a greater than fifteen thousand dollar ($15,000) or
fifteen percent decrease to a subdivision.
      (8)   During the term of this formula, if the total amount of Local
Government Fund money and Local Government Revenue Assistance Fund money is
less than the total amount received in the previous year, then all political
subdivisions will share the loss proportionally to their relative share.
         (Res. 40-95. Passed 9-12-95.)
236.06 POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR SELECTING DEPOSITORIES AND MAKING
INVESTMENTS.
   (a)   The investment policy prepared by the Director of Finance and approved

that transaction are not valid. Transactions made without receipts are
considered unauthorized.
      (2)   If an itemized receipt is lost and/or missing, the user of that
transaction must attest on a form held by the Finance Director of all the items
made during that transaction and certifying that all transactions were approved
and lawful. This is to be used on an absolute limited basis.

monthly credit card statements to ensure all transactions are lawful and
authorized.
      (2)   The monthly credit card statement shall be paid in a timely manner
to avoid any interest and/or penalties. Under no circumstance shall a monthly
balance intentionally remain from month to month to acquire interest on the
transaction. The only circumstance a transaction shall remain on the statement
from one month to another is if there is a dispute of that transaction. In this
case, the dispute shall be made to the credit card company and be removed by
the company if the transaction is incorrect.
   (o)   Credit Card Rewards. Any rewards and/or other fringe benefits received
by the issuance and/or use of a credit card shall not be for personal use and
if at all possible, not be granted on any credit card account. If rewards and/
or other fringe benefits are unavoidable, the Finance Director shall, at least

(Ord. 14-84. Passed 1-30-84.)
252.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF AREA; BOUNDARIES; HOUSING OFFICER.
   (a)   For the purpose of fulfilling the requirements set forth in Ohio R.C.
3735.65 to 3735.70, inclusive, Community Reinvestment Area No. 1 is hereby
established.
   (b)   The boundaries of Community Reinvestment Area No. 1 are fully set
forth in Exhibit A attached to original Resolution 1-84, passed January 30,
1984, which Exhibit is hereby made a part of this section by reference.
(Res. 1-84. Passed 1-30-84.)
   (c)   To administer and implement this section, the Manager or his or her
designee, as specified in writing, is designated as the Housing Officer as
described in Ohio R.C. 3735.65 and 3735.66.
(Res. 13-91. Passed 11-12-91.)
   (d)   A copy of this section shall be forwarded to the County Auditor by the
Director of Finance for information and reference.
   (e)   Council reserves the right to re-evaluate the designation of Community
Reinvestment Area No. 1 after five years, at which time Council may direct the
Housing Officer not to accept new applications for exemptions as described in
Ohio R.C. 3735.67.
   (f)   Council finds that the area included in Community Reinvestment Area
No. 1 is one in which housing facilities are located and new housing
construction and repair of existing facilities or structures are discouraged.
(Res. 1-84. Passed 1-30-84.)
252.04 TAX EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   This policy is adopted to provide direction to the Housing Officer
when administering CRA tax exceptions under the provisions of this Chapter and
all qualifying activities as per Ohio R.C. 3735.67.
   (b)   It shall be the policy of the City to grant CRA tax exceptions for
qualifying activities under this Chapter and Ohio R.C. 3735.67 based on the
following formula:
      (1)   The following calculation is designed to define the maximum term
for which any applicant company could qualify for abatement. The information
needed is as follows:
         A.   The number of employees at the time of application, the total
income of these employees, and the percentage of their work time spent in the
City (if applicable);
         B.   The "'true value", for tax purposes, of the real estate to be
abated.
   (c)   The process begins by calculating the annual real estate taxes
foregone by granting the abatement. This number will become the denominator in
the abatement calculation. The numerator in the calculation will be the annual
income tax revenue that the City expects to receive from employment at the
applicant company, as of the date of application, multiplied by fifteen (the
maximum number of years that abatement could be granted). The result of this
division will be a number that equates to the years it takes for breakeven
between the real estate taxes foregone and the income taxes to be received.
This result should be rounded down to the nearest whole number (year).
   (d)   The Housing Officer shall perform the preceding calculation for any
individual applying for CRA tax exceptions to determine the length of the tax
abatement. The minimum abatement period shall be five years and the maximum
fifteen years. Tax exceptions for retail and qualifying housing improvements
shall not exceed five years. The Housing Officer shall notify the applicant in
writing of the number of years to be exempted based on this policy. Any
aggrieved applicant may appeal the decision of the Housing Officer to the
Council Economic Development Committee upon written request within ten days
from the date of the notice of award.
(Res. 32-02. Passed 10-8-02.)

258.01 ADOPTION OF POLICY.
   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 9.132, the Municipality adopts a policy that it awards
contracts where competitive bidding is required to the lowest responsive and
responsible bidder.
(Res. 25-02. Passed 8-13-02.)
258.02 RESPONSIVE BID.
   For purposes of the above policy, a bid shall be considered responsive if
the proposal responds to bid specifications in all material aspects and
contains no irregularities or deviations from the specifications which would
affect the amount of the bid or otherwise give the bidder a competitive
advantage.
(Res. 25-02. Passed 8-13-02.)
258.03 RESPONSIBILITY OF BIDDER.
   For purposes of the above policy, the following factors may be considered
for purposes of determining if a bidder is responsible:
   (a)   The experience of the bidder;
   (b)   The bidder's financial condition;
   (c)   The bidder's conduct and performance on previous contracts;
   (d)   The bidder's facilities;
   (e)   The bidder's management skills;
   (f)   The bidder's ability to execute the contract properly.
      (Res. 25-02. Passed 8-13-02.)
258.04 NOTIFICATION OF BIDDER.
   If an apparent low bidder is found not responsive or responsible, such
bidder shall be notified by the Manager or his designee of that finding and the
reason for it. Such notice shall be sent by certified mail.
(Res. 25-02. Passed 8-13-02.)
258.05 AWARD OF CONTRACT; PROTEST.
   If a contract is awarded to a bidder other than the apparent low bidder or
bidders, the Manager or his designee shall meet with the apparent low bidder or
bidders upon the filing of a written protest received within five days of the
notification required in Section
258.04 hereof. No final award of the contract shall be made until the Manager
affirms or reverses his previous decision.
(Res. 25-02. Passed 8-13-02.)
258.06 STATE LAW INAPPLICABLE.
   This procedure is not subject to Ohio R.C. Chapter 119.
(Res. 25-02. Passed 8-13-02.)
258.07 LOCAL PREFERENCE.
   (a)   In competitive bid awards for the purchase of commodities and non-
professional services, the Municipality may grant a local preference to
businesses located with the Municipality. In determining the lowest and best
bidder or vendor, a five percent local preference may be computed on the amount
of the low bid meeting specifications by a non-Municipal bidder/vendor. The
preference may be applied up to a maximum of five percent or five thousand
dollars ($5,000), whichever is less.
   (b)   When proof of situs is required, the bidder/vendor must authorize a
release of information necessary to the Municipality to establish the business
location.
   (c)   (1)   Ties between one Municipal bidder/vendor and one or more non-
Municipal bidder/vendor(s) meeting specification shall be broken in favor of
the Municipal bidder/vendor.
      (2)   Ties between two or more Municipal bidder/vendors meeting
specifications shall be broken through a coin toss method until the winner
remains.
   (d)   The Manager or her designate may promulgate rules and regulations to
implement this section provided they are not inconsistent with the expressed
provisions of this section.

require, post a bond in an amount set by the court, to appear to answer to such
violations. The pound operator shall release such vehicle upon the receipt of
the release form and payment of all towage and storage charges. The removal
agency shall have the rights and obligations conferred upon it by Ohio R.C.
4513.60 et seq. in regard to the titling or disposition of an unclaimed
vehicle, except that, if not otherwise provided by State law, it shall have a

         A.   Using an electronic wireless communications device, as defined in
R.C. § 4511.204, in violation of that section.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
432.41.
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a

   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within 90 days of the underlying violation that resulted
in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
         If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the
violation and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars
($100.00), the court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the
additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender
instead may elect to attend the distracted driving safety course described in
subsection (b)(1) of this section. If the offender elects the course option and
attends and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued
written evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The
offender shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for
the violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in
division (b)(2) of this section that indicates that the offender was distracted
while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the officer shall do
both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer's law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender's race.

414.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
414.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
414.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
414.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
414.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
414.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

   (a)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic-control
device.
   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;
         C.   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
            The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs
of abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall
withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
            The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof
shall be analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health
by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
         If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.
hereof, the person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a
qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing
administer a chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to
any administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the

notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician- intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified

within 60 days of sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written
finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail
where the offender is required to serve the term, the offender will not be able
to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing, the court may impose an alternative sentence as specified in R.C. §

(d)(4) of this section, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted
driving safety course, as described in R.C. § 4511.991. If the offender attends
and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall not be required to pay the fine and shall not have the points assessed
against that offender's driver's license if the offender submits the written
evidence to the court within 90 days of the violation of division (a) of this
section. However, successful completion of the course does not result in a
dismissal of the charges for the violation, and the violation is a prior
offense under divisions (d)(1)B. and (d)(1)C. of this section if the offender
commits a subsequent violation or violations of division (a) of this section
within two years of the offense for which the course was completed. This
division does not apply with respect to any offender in the category of
offenders to whom division (d)(1)B., (d)(1)C., or (d)(1)D. of this section
applies.
      (3)   The court may impose any other penalty authorized under R.C. §§
2929.21 to 2929.28. However, the court shall not impose a fine or a suspension
not otherwise specified in division (d)(1) of this section. The court also
shall not impose a jail term or community residential sanction.
      (4)   Except as provided in division (d)(2) of this section, points shall
be assessed for a violation of division (a) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for purposes of enforcing this section
unless the officer visually observes the operator using, holding, or physically
supporting with any part of the person's body the electronic wireless
communications device.
      (2)   A law enforcement officer who stops the operator of a motor vehicle
for a violation of division (a) of this section shall inform the operator that
the operator may decline a search of the operator's electronic wireless
communications device. The officer shall not do any of the following:
         A.   Access the device without a warrant, unless the operator
voluntarily and unequivocally gives consent for the officer to access the
device;
         B.   Confiscate the device while awaiting the issuance of a warrant to
access the device;
         C.   Obtain consent from the operator to access the device through
coercion or any other improper means. Any consent by the operator to access the
device shall be voluntary and unequivocal before the officer may access the
device without a warrant.
   (g)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Electronic wireless communications device."
         A.   Includes any of the following:
            1.   A wireless telephone;
            2.   A text-messaging device;

436.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27,
the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

to the operator by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507
or a valid commercial driver’s license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
   (b)   No person shall receive a driver's license, or a motorcycle operator's
endorsement of a driver's or commercial driver's license, unless and until he
surrenders to the Registrar all valid licenses issued to him by another
jurisdiction recognized by the State of Ohio. No person shall be permitted to
have more than one valid license at any time.
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two
or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4507.02 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section has been
or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or
summons for a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section or causing the
arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation of division

motor vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
   (h)   This section does not apply when an emergency exists that threatens
the life of any person operating or occupying a motor vehicle that is being
used to transport a child who otherwise would be required to be restrained
under this section. This section does not apply to a person operating a motor
vehicle who has an affidavit signed by a physician licensed to practice in this
state under R.C. Chapter 4731 or a chiropractor licensed to practice in this

elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that

some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined

440.01 LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.    Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is
subject to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance
with this section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with R.C. §§ 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.    Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         B.   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under R.C. § 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed a
nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
         (ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Whoever violates any provision of this section for which no other
penalty is provided is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. (ORC 4513.99)
   (c)   Local Streets.  No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity
with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37, or exceeding a gross weight of five
tons, upon any street in the Municipality other than state routes and County
roads, except those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as
such by appropriate traffic signs. On County roads, Council or other duly
designated local authority shall establish reasonable weight limits
commensurate with the construction and material specifications for such roads
and the load resistance of such roads as determined by the County Engineer.
County roads shall be posted with signs indicating such weight limits.
   (d)   Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (1)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the

§ 3781.111(C) shall be mounted on a fixed or movable post, and the distance
from the ground to the bottom edge of the sign shall measure not less than five
feet. If a new sign or a replacement sign designating an accessible parking
location is posted on or after October 14, 1999, there also shall be affixed
upon the surface of that sign or affixed next to the designating sign a notice

entitled to be parked in that location.
   (f)   (1)   A.   No person shall stop, stand or park any motor vehicle at
accessible parking locations provided under division (e) of this section, or at

license plates.
         B.   Any motor vehicle that is parked in an accessible marked parking
location in violation of division (f)(1)A.1. or (f)(1)A.2. of this section may
be towed or otherwise removed from the parking location by the law enforcement
agency of the municipality. A motor vehicle that is so towed or removed shall
not be released to its owner until the owner presents proof of ownership of the
motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally imposed by the
municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor vehicle is a
leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the lessee
presents proof that that person is the lessee of the motor vehicle and pays all
towing and storage fees normally imposed by the municipality for towing and
storing motor vehicles.
         C.   If a person is charged with a violation of division (f)(1)A.1. or
(f)(1)A.2. of this section, it is an affirmative defense to the charge that the

provided under division (e) of this section or at an accessible clearly marked
parking location provided in or on a privately owned parking lot, parking
garage, or other parking area and designated in accordance with that division.
   (g)   When a motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of a
person with a disability that limits or impairs the ability to walk and is
displaying a removable windshield placard or accessible license plates, or when
a motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of a person with a
disability and is displaying a parking card or accessible license plates, the
motor vehicle is permitted to park for a period of two hours in excess of the
legal parking period permitted by local authorities, except where local
ordinances or police rules provide otherwise or where the vehicle is parked in
such a manner as to be clearly a traffic hazard.
   (h)   No owner of an office, facility or parking garage where accessible
parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with division (e)
of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking locations in
accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of the
accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed or
movable signs.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person or
organization to apply for a removable windshield placard or accessible license
plates if the parking card or accessible license plates issued to the person or
organization under prior law have not expired or been surrendered or revoked.

for employment, license, or other right or privilege, or made in connection
with the person’s appearance as a witness.

            (R.C. § 4511.69)
452.05 WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper,
upon notification to the chief of such action and of the location of the place
of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, including an abandoned
junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief
of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However, when such
a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be ordered into
storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief or state highway patrol trooper shall allow
the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the removal
of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief or state
highway patrol trooper. If the chief or state highway patrol trooper determines
that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of time, the
chief or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the chief shall designate
the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
division (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle by
a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity of
the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the presentation, shall issue a salvage
certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief of
a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation of the reason for leaving
the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.
         (R.C. § 4513.64)
452.055 PARKING PROHIBITIONS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY; PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation, upon complaint of any person adversely affected, may order into
storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or private
agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the chief
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to division (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle
only in accordance with division (d) of this section.
      (4)   As used in this section, “private residential property” means
private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than
three separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. The
phrase does not include any private property on which is located one or more
structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by two or more
persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in the structure
or structures.
   (b)   (1)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been
ordered into storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section arrives after
the motor vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual
removal from the property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator
oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that the chief orders
into storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section. The record shall
include an entry for each such motor vehicle that identifies the motor
vehicle’s license number, make, model, and color, the location from which it
was removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the
person from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it
has been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under division (a)
(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both of
the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 or, if the vehicle
was towed within a municipal corporation that has established fees for vehicle
removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees established by the
municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
R.C. § 4513.611.
      (3)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under division
(d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage under division (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any personal items
from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
      (4)   For purposes of division (d)(3) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (5)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
division (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for 30 days, the
procedures established by R.C. §§ 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

than in accordance with division (a)(1) of this section or R.C. §§ 4513.61 to
4513.65.
      (2)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with the
requirements of this section.
   (f)   This section does not apply to any private residential or private
agricultural property that is established as a private tow-away zone in
accordance with division (h) of this section or R.C. § 4513.601.
   (g)   Whoever violates division (e) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 4513.60)
   (h)   Private Tow-away Zones.
      (1)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away
zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         A.   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
            2.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.
If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
            3.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times,
the times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
            4.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
            5.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in R.C. § 4505.101(B).
            6.   In order to comply with the requirements of division (h)(1)A.
of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the
sign.
         B.   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this division
(h) is taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with
all of the following:
            1.   It is located within 25 linear miles of the location of the
private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to a
place of storage within 25 linear miles.
            2.   It is well-lighted.
            3.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly
scheduled route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public
transportation is available in the municipal corporation or township in which
the private tow-away zone is located.
      (2)   A.   If a vehicle is parked on private property that is established
as a private tow-away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this division (h). The vehicle owner and
the operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains
unclaimed as provided in R.C. § 4505.101. The owner or lienholder of a vehicle
that has been removed under this division (h), subject to division (h)(3) of
this section, may recover the vehicle in accordance with division (h)(7) of
this section.
         B.   If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck
operators to be licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to division (h)(2) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
         C.   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow- away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
      (3)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (h)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.
Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
      (4)   A.   Prior to towing a vehicle under division (h)(2) of this
section, a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many
photographs as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on
private property in violation of a private tow-away zone established under
division (h)(1) of this section. The towing service shall record the time and
date of the photographs taken under this division (h). The towing service shall

provide any information in the record that pertains to a particular vehicle to
a person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner, operator, or lienholder of the vehicle and requests information
pertaining to the vehicle.
      (6)   A.   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance

with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service utilizing any form
of delivery requiring a signed receipt;
            2.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed 30 days after the first
notice is sent, in the manner required under division (h)(6)C.1. of this
section.
         D.   Sixty days after any notice sent pursuant to division (h)(6)C. of
this section is received, as evidenced by a receipt signed by any person, or
the towing service or storage facility has been notified that delivery was not
possible, the towing service or storage facility, if authorized under R.C. §
4505.101(B), may initiate the process for obtaining a certificate of title to
the motor vehicle as provided in that section.
         E.   A towing service or storage facility that does not receive a
signed receipt of notice, or a notification that delivery was not possible,
shall not obtain, and shall not attempt to obtain, a certificate of title to
the motor vehicle under R.C. § 4505.101(B).
         F.   With respect to a vehicle concerning which a towing service or
storage facility is not eligible to obtain title under R.C. § 4505.101, the
towing service or storage facility need only comply with the initial notice
required under division (h)(6)C.1. of this section.
      (7)   A.   The owner or lienholder of a vehicle that is removed under
division (h)(2) of this section may reclaim it upon both of the following:
            1.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title to the vehicle, a certificate of registration for the
motor vehicle, or a lease agreement;
            2.   Payment of the following fees:
               a.   All applicable fees established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, except that the lienholder of
a vehicle may retrieve the vehicle without paying any storage fee for the
period of time that the vehicle was in the possession of the towing service or
storage facility prior to the date the lienholder received the notice sent

request, the towing service or storage facility shall provide a copy of all
photographs in the medium in which the photographs are stored, whether paper,
electronic, or otherwise.
         C.   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves
the vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the
vehicle shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the
motor vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action
under R.C. § 4513.611.
         D.   Upon presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced
by a certificate of title to the vehicle, a certificate of registration for the
motor vehicle, or a lease agreement, the owner of a vehicle that is removed
under authority of division (h)(2) of this section may retrieve any personal
items from the vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. The owner of the vehicle shall not retrieve any personal items from a

the stop for loading and unloading of materials exceed 30 minutes.
452.10 BUS STOPS AND TAXICAB STANDS.
   (a)   No person shall stop, stand or park a vehicle other than a bus in a

   (b)   No operator of a bus shall stop, stand or park such vehicle upon any

452.115 PROHIBITED PARKING OF TRACTOR TRAILERS AND COMMERCIAL VEHICLES;
DETACHED VEHICLES.
   (a)   The parking of tractor trailers is prohibited within the Municipal

loading of a tractor trailer not to exceed a period of seven days, the
transportation and hauling of goods from place to place which is the normal
intended use of tractor trailers, or a business involved in the sale and
purchase of tractor trailers. No person shall park or leave standing for more
than two hours any commercial vehicle, semi-tractor, semitrailer on any street
or highway in a Residential District of the Municipality, except for loading or
unloading. Commercial vehicle shall be defined as any vehicle over 11,000

employees of the Municipality, including fire trucks, maintenance vehicles and
emergency vehicles, while on official business or when and where authorized by
executive order of the Manager.
   (b)   It is hereby prohibited and deemed a violation of this section for a
tractor trailer to be used as a substitute for a storage building, a place of
business, a housing unit, a structure which is being used to primarily post or
contain a sign, or in any other way for which the tractor trailer was not
designed or for which it is being used as an apparent subterfuge to avoid the
licensing or regulation of the end use of the tractor trailer. An example is
using a tractor trailer as a storage structure (not its designed purpose) which
prevents proper regulation of the storage structure by avoiding the building
permit process of the Municipality.
   (c)   All tractor trailers shall be required to comply with all Municipal,
State and Federal laws and shall not be used to store any hazardous materials
which may be detrimental to the welfare of the citizens of the Municipality.
Tractor trailers shall not be used as any type of building for human use, for
the storage of goods or for a structure being used to primarily post or contain
a sign.
   (d)   An exception to this section is a tractor trailer that has been
converted for use as a construction office at a site that has a valid building
permit. However, even in this case the tractor trailer is not allowed to
adversely affect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the
Municipality.
   (e)   A tractor trailer as defined in this section shall constitute either
the tractor or trailer if connected or the tractor or trailer if separated. The
prohibition contained in this section apply with equal force to the tractor or
trailer.
   (f)   No person shall park any trailer detached from a motor vehicle on any
street in the Municipality. An attached trailer for the purpose of loading and
unloading may be parked for a period not to exceed 4 hours in a 24-hour period.
Overnight parking is prohibited.
   (g)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree and shall be subject to the penalty provided in Section
408.01.

09; Ord. 18-10. Passed 9-28-10; Ord. 20-11. Passed 10-25-11.)
452.12 REGISTERED OWNER PRIMA FACIE LIABLE FOR UNLAWFUL PARKING.
   In any hearing on a charge of illegally parking a motor vehicle, testimony
that a vehicle bearing a certain license plate was found unlawfully parked as
prohibited by the provisions of this Traffic Code, and further testimony that
the record of the Ohio Registrar of Motor Vehicles shows that the license plate
was issued to the defendant, shall be prima facie evidence that the vehicle
which was unlawfully parked, was so parked by the defendant. A certified
registration copy, showing such fact, from the Registrar shall be proof of such
ownership.
452.13 WAIVER.
   Any person charged with a violation of any provision of this chapter for
which payment of a prescribed fine may be made, may pay such sum in the manner
prescribed on the issued traffic ticket. Such payment shall be deemed a plea of
guilty, waiver of court appearance and acknowledgment of conviction of the
alleged offense and may be accepted in full satisfaction of the prescribed
penalty for such alleged violation. Payment of the prescribed fine need not be
accepted when laws prescribe that a certain number of such offenses shall
require court appearance.

      (ORC 2901.01, 2921.01)
606.02 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
606.03 CLASSIFICATION OF OFFENSES.
   As used in this General Offenses Code:
   (a)   Offenses include misdemeanors of the first, second, third, and fourth
degree, minor misdemeanors, and offenses not specifically classified.
   (b)   Regardless of the penalty that may be imposed, any offense
specifically classified as a misdemeanor is a misdemeanor.
   (c)   Any offense not specifically classified is a misdemeanor if
imprisonment for not more than one year may be imposed as a penalty.

only penalty that may be imposed is one of the following:
      (1)   For an offense committed prior to January 1, 2004, a fine not

   (c)   This section does not affect the power of a court to punish for
contempt or to employ any sanction authorized by law to enforce an order, civil

it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the

constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.

meanings as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01.

         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two

      (2)   As used in this division:
         A.   The phrase “offense is directly related to the misconduct in
office of a public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of
Ohio R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A),

      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until the course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected or believed to have
occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 2935.01.
   (l)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section that
took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03

on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of R.C. § 2903.01 or R.C. § 2903.02 if the
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4, 2023, and
applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.
         (R.C. § 2901.13)
606.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
606.02.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
606.08 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
606.09 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
606.10 FALSIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall knowingly make a false statement, or knowingly swear
or affirm the truth of a false statement previously made, when any of the
following applies:
      (1)   The statement is made in any official proceeding.
      (2)   The statement is made with purpose to incriminate another.
      (3)   The statement is made with purpose to mislead a public official in
performing the public official’s official function.

      (5)   The statement is made with purpose to secure the issuance by a
governmental agency of a license, permit, authorization, certificate,
registration, release or provider agreement.
      (6)   The statement is sworn or affirmed before a notary public or
another person empowered to administer oaths.
      (7)   The statement is in writing on or in connection with a report or
return that is required or authorized by law.
      (8)   The statement is in writing, and is made with purpose to induce
another to extend credit to or employ the offender, or to confer any degree,
diploma, certificate of attainment, award of excellence or honor on the
offender, or to extend to or bestow upon the offender any other valuable
benefit or distinction, when the person to whom the statement is directed
relies upon it to that person’s detriment.

commission of a theft offense.
      (10)   The statement is knowingly made to a probate court in connection
with any action, proceeding or other matter within its jurisdiction, either
orally or in a written document, including, but not limited to, an application,
petition, complaint or other pleading, or an inventory, account or report.
      (11)   The statement is made on an account, form, record, stamp, label or
other writing that is required by law.
      (12)   The statement is made in a document or instrument of writing that
purports to be a judgment, lien, or claim of indebtedness and is filed or
recorded with the Secretary of State, a county recorder, or the clerk of a
court of record.
      (13)   The statement is required under Ohio R.C. 5743.71 in connection
with the person’s purchase of cigarettes or tobacco products in a delivery
sale.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under subsection (a)(6) hereof that the
oath or affirmation was administered or taken in an irregular manner.
   (c)   If contradictory statements relating to the same fact are made by the
offender within the period of the statute of limitations for falsification, it
is not necessary for the prosecution to prove which statement was false, but
only that one or the other was false.
   (d)   (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsection (a)(1) to (8) or
(10) to (13) hereof is guilty of falsification, a misdemeanor of the first
degree.
      (2)   Whoever violates subsection (a)(9) hereof is guilty of
falsification in a theft offense, a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the
value of the property or services stolen is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or
more, falsification in a theft offense is a felony and shall be prosecuted
under appropriate State law.
   (e)   A person who violates this section is liable in a civil action to any

incurred as a result of the commission of the offense and for reasonable
attorney’s fees, court costs, and other expenses incurred as a result of

determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.

642.02 or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
642.02,
642.04, or
642.05,
642.15(b)(1) or (2), or Section
642.19 or
642.145 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section

642.02 or
642.19 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
642.02 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being

a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under

single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each

violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on

materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, “fair
market value” is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61(B) - (E))

property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
642.09:
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort, or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, “fair market value” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2913.61.
   (c)   Prima facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Ohio
R.C. 2913.61(D), may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to

rendered through the meter, conduit or attachment, and who is in possession or
control of the meter, conduit or attachment at the time the tampering occurred
has caused the tampering with intent to commit a theft offense.
   (b)   In a prosecution for a theft offense, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2913.01,
that involves the alleged reconnection of a gas, electric, steam or water

698.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Dangerous offender” means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   “Repeat offender” means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or
more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses, as

for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent felony drug
abuse offense;
      (5)   Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or
degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offenses, or minor
misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
         (ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (a)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (a)(1)
      (4)   Divisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (a)(1) to (a)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the Municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
         (ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in § 666.99 or 698.03 of this code or R.C. §
2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this section and unless another term
is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the sentencing court imposing a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a
jail term on the offender pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a
definite jail term that shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal
               ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
         (R.C. § 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section 666.99 and 698.03 of this Code
or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is required by law, in
sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, the
sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
               jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to
the jail term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the              conditions of the sanctions
imposed. If the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of
probation has been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in
that jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
         (R.C. § 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   A term of up to 180 days in an alternative residential facility
or a term in an alternative residential facility not to exceed the longest jail
term available for the offense, whichever is shorter. The court may specify the
level of security in the alternative residential facility that is needed for
the offender;
         C.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in Ohio R.C.
307.932, a term of up to 60 days in a community alternative sentencing center
or district community alternative sentencing center established and operated in
accordance with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section,
with one of the conditions of the sanction being that the offender complete in
the center the entire term imposed.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)C. of this section shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. 307.932. In all
other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, alternative
residential facility, community alternative sentencing center, district
community alternative sentencing center, or other place at which the offender
will serve the residential sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in
charge of the operation of the halfway house, alternative residential facility,
community alternative sentencing center, district community alternative
sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender to be
examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including but
not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, and other contagious diseases. The person
in charge of the operation of the halfway house, alternative residential
facility, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place at which the offender will serve
the residential sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house,
alternative residential facility, community alternative sentencing center,
district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who refuses to
be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including but
not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, or another contagious disease to be tested
and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section. (ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         C.   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor of
the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or fourth

         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender's privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender's motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator's license, or any other related sanction;
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
         (ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for anyamount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:

thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
       (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state or political subdivision may
do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
         (R.C. § 2929.28)
698.03 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section 698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim's representative, the victim's
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
         (R.C. § 2929.22)
698.04 ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand
dollars ($3,000.00);
      (4)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two thousand

($1,000.00);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(E), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to

2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor. (ORC 2929.41)
698.06 SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially equivalent.

(Ord. 2-15. Passed 1-27-15.)
880.06 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Each resident natural person who is eighteen years of age or older,
and every business which conducts business in the Municipality, shall file a
return, whether or not a tax is due thereon, on or before April 15 of the year
following the effective date of this chapter.
   Any other person or business who or which earns taxable income in the
Municipality, shall, whether or not a tax is due thereon, make and file a
return on or before April 15 of the year following the effective date of this
chapter except nonresident employees who work in the Municipality and whose
employers withhold taxes from their wages in the amount specified by this
chapter.
   When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period different from the
calendar year, the return shall be filed within four months from the end of
such fiscal year or period. The Finance Director is hereby authorized to
provide, by regulation, that the return of an employer, showing the amount of
tax deducted by such employer from the salaries, wages, commissions or other
compensation of an employee, and paid by him or her to the Finance Director,
shall be accepted, unless otherwise specified, as the return required of any
employee whose sole income, subject to tax under this chapter, is such
salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation.
   (b)   The return shall be filed with the Finance Director on a form
furnished by or obtainable upon request from such Finance Director setting
forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned and gross income from the business, profession or other
activity, less the allowable ordinary, reasonable and necessary expenses
incurred in the acquisition of such gross income earned during the preceding
year and subject to such tax;
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns or other
information as the Finance Director may require.
   The Municipality shall accept a generic form of any return, report or
document required to be filed if the generic form, once completed and filed,
contains all of the information required to be submitted with the
Municipality's prescribed returns, reports or documents, and if the taxpayer or
return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the rules or
ordinances of the Municipality governing the filing of returns, reports or
documents.
For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, a taxpayer subject to
any municipal corporation's tax on the net profit from a business or profession
may file any municipal income tax return or estimated municipal income return
by using the Ohio business gateway.
   (c)   The Finance Director may extend the time of filing of the annual
return based on the following:
      (1)   Any taxpayer who has requested an extension for filing a Federal
income tax return may request an extension for the filing of an annual tax
return. The taxpayer shall make the request by filing a copy of the taxpayer's
request for a Federal filing extension with the Finance Director.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to file a Federal income tax return may
request an extension for filing an annual tax return in writing.
      (3)   On or after January 1, 2005 any taxpayer that is subject to any
municipal corporation's tax on the net profit from a business or profession and
has received an extension to file the federal income tax return shall not be
required to notify the municipal corporation of the federal extension and shall
not be required to file any municipal income tax return until the last day of
the month to which the date for filing the federal return has been extended,
provided that, on or before the date for filing the Municipal income tax
return, the person notifies the Tax Commissioner of the federal extension
through the Ohio business gateway. An extension of time to file is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due as provided in Ohio R.C. 718.05.
      (4)   The request for extension shall be filed not later than the last
day for filing the Municipal annual tax return as prescribed by ordinance or
rule of the Municipality.
      (5)   The extended due date of the Municipal income tax return shall be
the last day of the month following the month to which the due date of the
federal income tax return has been extended.
      (6)   The Municipality may deny a taxpayer's request for extension if the
taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request;
         B.   Fails to file a copy of the Federal extension request or written
request;
         C.   Owes the Municipality any delinquent income tax or any penalty,
interest, assessment or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of
income tax; or
         D.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (7)   The granting of an extension for filing a Municipal income tax
return does not extend the last date for payment of the tax; hence, penalty and
interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of extension at the rate
set out by Sections
880.11 and
880.99. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the extension period, provided that all
other filing and payment requirements of the Tax Code have been met. Any
extension by the Finance Director shall be granted with the understanding that
declaration filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if,
upon further examination it then becomes evident that declaration filing and
payment requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be
assessed in full and in the same manner as though no extension had been
granted.
   (d)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing thereof,
pay to the Finance Director the amount of taxes shown as due thereon. However,
where any portion of the tax so due has been deducted at the source pursuant to
Section
880.07, or where any portion of the tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant
to Section
880.08, or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality, credit
for the amount so paid in accordance with Sections
880.07,
880.08 and
880.16 shall be deducted (not to exceed one and one-half percent) from the
amount shown to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable
at the time of filing the return.
   (e)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the
Municipality is entitled under this chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability under this chapter or, at his or her election
indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded,
provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than five dollars ($5.00)
shall be collected or refunded.
   (f)   Where necessary, a taxpayer must file an amended return in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or to claim a refund
of tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in
Sections
880.12 and
880.16. Such amended return shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Finance Director. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
   (g)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's tax liability to the Municipality, such
taxpayer shall make and file an amended return showing income subject to the
income tax of the Municipality, based upon such final determination of the
Federal tax liability, shall pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make a
claim for liability and shall pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make
a claim for refund of any overpayment.
(Res. 29-00. Passed 12-12-00; Ord. 28-04. Passed 11-9-04.)

   (a)   In accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Finance
Director, each employer within or doing business within the Municipality shall
deduct, at the time of the payment of salaries, wages, commissions or other
compensation, a tax at the rate provided in Section
880.02 hereof on the qualifying salaries, wages, commissions or other
compensation due by the employer to the employee and shall, on or before the
fifteenth day of the month following such withholding, make a return and pay to
the Finance Director the amount of taxes so deducted. The return shall be on a
form or forms prescribed by or acceptable to the Finance Director and shall be
subject to the rules and regulations prescribed by the Finance Director. Such
employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and
withheld, whether or not such taxes have in fact been withheld.
   (b)   So long as the taxes withheld by an employer for the Municipality
during the measurement period are less than three hundred dollars ($300.00) per
month, payments may be made quarterly on or before the last day of the month
following the end of the quarter, subject to the approval of the Finance
Director. The Finance Director may revoke the approval of quarterly filing and
payments whenever he or she has reason to believe that the conditions for
granting such authorization have changed, were judged incorrectly or were not
met, or when it is in the best interest of the Municipality to do so. Notice of
withdrawal shall be made in writing and, in such case, the employer must begin
to file in accordance with this section.
   (c)   Each employer within or doing business within the Municipality shall
deduct such taxes regardless of the employee's residency or age.
   (d)   Such employer, in collecting the tax, shall be deemed to hold the
same, until payment is made by such employer to the Municipality, as a trustee
for the benefit of the Municipality, and any such tax collected by such
employer from his or her employees shall, until the same is paid to the
Municipality, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer.
   (e)   On or before February 28 of each year, beginning with the year 1990,
each employer shall file a withholding return setting forth the names and
addresses of all employees from whose compensation the tax was withheld during
the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld from his or her
employees and such other information as may be required by the Finance
Director. All payments not subject to withholding shall be reported on a form
required by the Finance Director.
   (f)   The Finance Director, for good cause, may require immediate returns
and payments to be submitted to his or her office.
(Res. 29-00. Passed 12-12-00; Ord. 28-04. Passed 11-9-04.)

to Section
880.07, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
subject to the tax imposed by this chapter, shall file a declaration setting
forth such estimated income or the estimated profit or loss from such business
activity, together with the estimated tax due thereon, if any. However, if a

months after the beginning of each fiscal year or period.

from the Finance Director, provided that credit shall be taken for the
Municipal income tax to be withheld from any portion of such income. In
accordance with Section
880.16, credit may be taken for tax to be paid to, or to be withheld and
remitted to, another taxing municipality.
   The original declaration (or any subsequent amendment thereof) may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment date
provided for herein.
   (d)   Such declaration of estimated tax to be paid to the Municipality shall
be accompanied by a payment of at least one-fourth of the estimated annual tax
and at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the last day of the
seventh, tenth and thirteenth months after the beginning of the taxable year.
However, if an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance shown to
be due thereon shall be paid in equal installments on or before the remaining
payment dates.
   (e)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, a taxpayer
subject to any municipal corporation's tax on the net profit from a business or
profession may make payments of amount shown on declaration of estimated tax
due by using the Ohio business gateway.
   (f)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which such declaration or amended declaration was filed, an

   The Finance Director shall enforce the payment of all taxes owed to the
Municipality and shall keep accurate records for a minimum of five years
showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to file a declaration and/or
to make any return, including taxes withheld, and showing the dates and amounts
of payments thereof.
   (b)   The Finance Director is hereby charged with the enforcement of this
chapter and is hereby authorized, subject to the approval of the Board of
Review, to adopt, promulgate and enforce rules and regulations relating to any
matter or thing pertaining to the collection of taxes and the administration
and enforcement of this chapter, including provisions for the re-examination
and correction of returns.
   The Finance Director is authorized to arrange for the payment of unpaid
taxes, interest and penalties on a schedule of installment payments, when the
taxpayer has proved to the Finance Director that due to certain hardship
conditions he or she is unable to pay the full amount of the tax due. Such
authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are filed by the
taxpayer for all amounts owed by him or her under this chapter. Failure to make
any deferred payment when due shall cause the total unpaid amount, including
penalty and interest, to become payable on demand and the provisions of
Sections
880.11,
880.12 and
880.99 shall apply.
   (c)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return which does

amount of tax appearing to be due to the Municipality from the taxpayer and
shall send to such taxpayer a written statement showing the amount of tax so
determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any.
   (d)   Subject to the consent of the Board of Review or pursuant to a
regulation approved by the Board, the Finance Director may compromise any
interest or penalty, or both, imposed under Section
880.11.

by employers under the provisions of this chapter and remaining unpaid after

Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by Governor Kasich
on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal corporations to conform to
and adopt the provisions of ORC 718 in order to have the authority to impose,
enforce, administer and collect a municipal income tax.
   (B)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 2015-18,
effective January 1, 2016, comprehensively amends Chapter
881 in accordance with the provisions of ORC 718 to allow the Municipality to
continue the income tax and withholding tax administration and collection

deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the

a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the

successor entity.

failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)   Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages

than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in section
881.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)    For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
881.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)   Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of section
881.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest

withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties

         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
      If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041

lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding

the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding

lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net

personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.

      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

881.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative

      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal

solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be

which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation

received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that

extent that such credit is allowed under Section
881.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
881.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.

   (B)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code a valid election made by the taxpayer under division (B)(1) or
(2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code is
terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code is

   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury

federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section

881.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
881.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
881.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
881.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
881.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may

881.07 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for a municipal corporation's
income tax for the current taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to a municipal

purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.

first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration

fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be

   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the

beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the

liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the

taxable year, ninety per cent of the tax liability for the taxable year. For a
person other than an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of twelfth
month of the taxable year, ninety percent of the tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section
881.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated

in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be

per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
881.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.

881.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
 
881.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
   (A)   Where a taxpayer of the Municipality is subject to a municipal income
tax in another municipality, he or she shall not pay a total Municipal income
tax on the same income greater than the tax imposed at the higher rate.
   (B)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the Municipality who receives
net profits, salaries, wages, commissions or other personal service
compensation for work done or services performed or rendered outside of the
Municipality, if it is made to appear that he or she has paid a municipal
income tax on the same income taxable under this chapter to another
municipality, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter
of the amount so paid by him or her, or on his or her behalf, to such other
municipality. The credit shall not exceed the tax assessed by this chapter on
such income earned in such other municipality where such tax is paid.
   (C)   Except as provided in subsection (d) hereof, if tax or withholding is
paid to an incorrect municipal corporation on income or wages after the time
period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid by the incorrect
municipal corporation, a nonrefundable credit, against the tax or withholding,
shall be allowed against the tax or withholding due to the Municipality with
respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the
incorrect municipal corporation with respect to such income or wages.
   (D)   If the tax rate of the Municipality is less than the tax rate of the
municipal corporation to which tax or withholding was incorrectly paid, then
the credit described in subsection (c) hereof shall be calculated using the tax
rate in effect in the Municipality.
   (E)   A claim for a refund or credit under this section shall be made in
such manner as the Tax Administrator may, by regulation, provide.

881.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are

limitation on refunds as provided in Section
881.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
881.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
881.096 of this Chapter.

881.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the tax
administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
881.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
881.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
881.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
881.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in section
881.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in section
881.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (A)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)   For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
section
881.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of this
section for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or less, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in section
881.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
881.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section 881.10 of this Chapter.
   (E)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in

alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the

required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required

fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped, rounding down to
the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a
document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document.

   (B)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax

Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (H)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
   (I)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in section

      (Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action is
in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to section
881.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
section
881.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section
881.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in section
881.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
881.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of section
881.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality. Two members shall be
appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality, and may not be
employees, elected officials, or contractors with the Municipality at any time
during their term or in the five years immediately preceding the date of
appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top administrative official
of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of the Municipality, but
may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax
Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly involved in
municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (B)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
881.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
881.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
881.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
881.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

by notifying the tax commissioner and the Municipality, on a form prescribed by
the tax commissioner.
      (2)   (a)   The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the
taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year

         (b)   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third

   (C)   The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances. In addition to any other powers conferred
upon the tax commissioner by law, the tax commissioner may:
      (1)   Prescribe all forms necessary to administer those sections;
      (2)   Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)   Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out the

(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.51 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703 of the Revised
Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference
in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and Section
881.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall control
for all uses of that term in Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)   "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
881.52 of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (B)   "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code and
Section
881.03 of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)   Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
Section
881.56 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of Section
881.56 of the Codified Ordinances.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (47)(A) of Section
881.03 of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded partnership
that has made the election described in division (23)(D) of Section
881.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal
taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation,
except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a
partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)   "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
881.03 (47) of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not include
natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745 of
the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)   "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal income
taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)   "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)   "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section
881.60 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.52 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the Municipality and that has made the election under Section
881.50 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of all
of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
881.52 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
881.60 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)   The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
881.60 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)   The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the
Municipality as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the Municipality only if, regardless of where title passes, the
property meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the Municipality
from a stock of goods located within the Municipality.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the Municipality from a
location outside the Municipality, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
Municipality and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Municipality to the extent that such services are performed in the
Municipality.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to the Municipality.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to
the Municipality.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Municipality based upon the extent to which
the tangible personal property is used in the Municipality.
   (E)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the Municipality in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the Municipality based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the Municipality to the commissions received from the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (C)(12) and (R)(1)(d) of Section
881.03 of the Codified Ordinances by the Municipality or substantially similar
provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the
taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's
net profit that was apportioned to the Municipality. In no case shall a
taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the
Municipality any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Municipality
under this section.
   (G)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.53 CERTIFICATION OF AMOUNTS TO BE PAID MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS.
   (A)   On or before the last day of each month, the tax commissioner shall
certify to the director of budget and management the amount to be paid to each
municipal corporation, based on amounts reported on annual returns and
declarations of estimated tax under sections 718.85 and 718.88 of the Revised
Code, less any amounts previously distributed and net of any audit adjustments
made or refunds granted by the commissioner, for the calendar month preceding
the month in which the certification is made. Not later than the fifth day of
each month, the director shall provide for payment of the amount certified to
each municipal corporation from the municipal income tax fund, plus a pro rata
share of any investment earnings accruing to the fund since the previous
payment under this section. Each municipal corporation's share of such earnings
shall equal the proportion that the municipal corporation's certified tax
payment is of the total taxes certified to all municipal corporations in that
quarter. All investment earnings on money in the municipal income tax fund
shall be credited to that fund.
   (B)   If the tax commissioner determines that the amount of tax paid by a
taxpayer and distributed to a municipal corporation under this section for a
taxable year exceeds the amount payable to that municipal corporation under
sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code after accounting for amounts
remitted with the annual return and as estimated taxes, the commissioner shall
proceed according to divisions (A) and (B) of section 5703.77 of the Revised
Code.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)

   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by Sections
881.50 to

such information, except for official purposes, in accordance with a proper
judicial order, or as provided in section 4123.271 or 5703.21 of the Revised
Code. The tax commissioner may furnish the internal revenue service with copies

apportionable to the Municipality under this chapter for any prior year:
      (1)   The taxpayer's name, address, and federal employer identification

other information it receives in the performance of its administration of the
municipal net profits tax for taxpayers making the election provided in Section
881.50 of the Codified Ordinances. The tax administrator shall review these
returns and information, as well as the information received pursuant to
divisions (B) and (C) of this section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer
for audit by the tax commissioner. Such referral shall be made on a form
prescribed by the commissioner and shall include any information that forms the
basis for the referral.
      (2)   If the tax commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the tax administrator under this section, the Municipality reserves its right
to pursue any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the
correct tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.
         (Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.55 FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   (1)   For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual

881.56 of the Codified Ordinances onto its annual return.
      (3)   The remittance shall be made payable to the treasurer of state and

information.
         (b)   A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically
through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the tax
commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission

   (C)   (1)   (a)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the
commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)   An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)   If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with Section
881.011 of the Codified Ordinances, the commissioner may require taxpayers to
file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this section,
including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (D)   Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section shall
include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the tax commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (E)   When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.551 ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (A)   All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under Section
881.50 of the Codified Ordinances shall file any tax return or extension for
filing a tax return, and shall make payment of amounts shown to be due on such
returns, electronically, either through the Ohio business gateway or in another
manner as prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   A taxpayer may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the
commissioner, to be excused from the requirement to file returns and make

      (1)   The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns and
make payments by electronic means;

881.063 of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the tax commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under Section
881.50 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
881.51 of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of Section
881.51 of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
881.52 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
881.52 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in Section
881.52 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
881.52 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from"
appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations"
for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Section
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.57 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
881.50 of the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under
Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before the
date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under Section
881.60 of the Codified Ordinances, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.58 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)   Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)   If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.59 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
      (1)   If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a
penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)   For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)   For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
881.50 of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax required
to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to
fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section
881.61 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
Section
881.60 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for the
assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-17-18.)
881.60 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under Section
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Section
881.61 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)   If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section
881.61 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by
that section.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.61 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of Section
881.60 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)   Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.62 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
Section
881.50 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
881.60 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
881.61 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
881.61 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.63 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)   The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof, may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to Sections
881.50 to
881.65 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)   The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
(Ord. 4A-18. Passed 2-27-18.)
881.64 CREDITS.
   (A)   A credit, granted by resolution or ordinance of the Municipality
pursuant to Section
881.064 or
881.065 of the Codified Ordinances, shall be available to a taxpayer that has
made the election allowed under Section
881.50 of the Codified Ordinances, against the municipal corporation's tax on
income. A municipal corporation shall submit the following information to the
tax commissioner on or before the later of January 31, 2018, or the thirty-
first day of January of the first year in which the taxpayer is eligible to
receive the credit:
      (1)   A copy of the agreement entered into by the Municipality and
taxpayer under Section
881.064 or
881.065 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (2)   A copy of the ordinance or resolution authorizing the agreement
entered into between the Municipality and the taxpayer.
   (B)   (1)   Each taxpayer that claims a credit shall submit, with the
taxpayer's tax return, documentation issued by the Municipality granting the
credit that confirms the eligibility of the taxpayer for the credit, the amount
of the credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the tax year to which the
credit is to be applied.
      (2)   Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered

1020.01 MAINTENANCE OF STATE HIGHWAYS BY OHIO DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION.
   The consent of the Municipality is hereby given to the Ohio Department of
Transportation to maintain the traveled portions of, to apply standard
longitudinal pavement markings on, to erect regulatory and warning signs about,
and to plow snow and place abrasives for ice control on, State highways in the
Municipality, in accordance with standard practices of the Department.
(Ord. 40-91. Passed 12-11-91.)
1020.02 CURB, GUTTER AND SIDEWALK POLICY.
   (a)   Policy Statement.  
      (1)   Sidewalks are a fundamental component of the Municipality's
transportation and recreation system and provide inherent safety and value to
the adjacent property owner, the surrounding neighborhood, and to the general
public. The provision of sidewalks in planned subdivisions shall be required
based upon the following public benefits:
         A.   Enhanced safety for children playing on their block and in a
neighborhood; and
         B.   Protection of children and adults walking to and from schools,
parks, neighbors, neighborhood shopping, and public transit stops or walking
recreationally.
      (2)   Whenever a development plan is submitted, it shall be a requirement
of the owner/developer to install sidewalks, curb and gutter based upon the
specifications established by the Municipality. This requirement applies to all
developments including residential, commercial, office, retail and industrial.
The Municipality's Planning and Zoning Code shall be amended to require all
infrastructure improvements for any development. The Municipality's Subdivision
Regulations shall also be amended to identify specific criteria for
consideration of any deferrals of sidewalk, curb and gutter. The criteria for
deferral of infrastructure improvements shall be reviewed by the Planning
Commission with a recommendation to Council for review and final approval.
   (b)   Maintenance Requirements.
      (1)   The repair of existing sidewalks, curbs and gutters shall be the
responsibility of the property owner per Ohio R.C. 729.01. The costs associated
with these repairs shall be paid directly in accordance with Ohio R.C. 729.02.
      (2)   The Municipality will strive to notify property owners in advance
by letter of streets and lots included in the Municipality's sidewalk, curb and
gutter program. The Municipality will attempt to provide property owners with a
notice of three years in advance of the inclusions of their property in the
sidewalk, curb and gutter program with a one-year notice prior to the actual
work. Due to changes that can occur over time in the streets scheduled for the
sidewalk, curb and gutter program, the three-year notice will include a
statement alerting property owners that the schedule of streets might change
which could affect the actual date that their street and property would be
included in the program. In cases where the list of streets included in the
program changes during annual updates of the Municipality's Capital Improvement
Plan, the Municipality will strive to give as much advance notice as possible
to the affected property owners.
   (c)   Petition for Sidewalk, Curb and Gutter. If property owners of an area
without sidewalk, curb and gutter request the installation of same, the cost
for these improvements shall be borne entirely by the affected property owners.
This request must be accomplished through a petition signed by a majority of
the affected property owners. The installation of any missing gaps in sidewalk,
curb and gutter under this provision should be done for the entire affected
block.
   (d)   Tree Replacement Program. With the installation, repair or replacement
of sidewalk, curb and gutter, it is necessary at times to remove trees that
physically affect the work or have impacted and damaged the adjacent sidewalk,
curb or gutter. Given the importance and value of trees to the community and to
neighborhoods, the Municipality will work with property owners to replace trees
removed by sidewalk, curb and gutter work. The Municipality will make available
to property owners a list of approved trees and recommended locations where the
tree(s) should be planted. The cost for the replacement tree(s) and
installation will be paid for by the Municipality.
   (e)   Effective Date. This policy will be in effect for all future sidewalk,
curb and gutter programs.

1022.01 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED; MINIMUM STANDARDS; ADOPTION OF STATE
SPECIFICATIONS.
   (a)   A developer shall enter into an agreement with Council prior to the
final approval of subdivision plans to make street improvements as prescribed
in this chapter. All improvements shall be carried out in full compliance with
the specifications for each of the various branches of the work. Nothing in
this chapter shall be construed to prohibit subdividers from constructing
higher types of improvements than the minimum required by the Municipality as
described in this chapter.
   (b)   The State of Ohio, Department of Transportation, Construction and
Material Specifications, referenced sections only, are hereby made a part of
this chapter by reference, shall be considered in full force as if completely
reproduced in this chapter and shall be referred to as the O.D.T., for the sake
of brevity. The O.D.T. used shall be the latest revision thereof.
1022.02 IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Generally. A developer shall improve streets or highways which are a
part of a subdivision. In addition, new or existing construction within a
right-of-way, damaged beyond reasonable wear or tear, by construction equipment
or excessive trench work, shall be restored to its original condition.
   (b)   Plans and Profiles. A centerline profile of proposed streets or roads,
with typical cross sections indicating proposed crowns and slopes anticipated
in meeting required street improvements, shall be a part of or accompany a
preliminary plan. All drainage and drainage structures shall be indicated on
the profile and all profiles shall be submitted to Council for approval before
construction begins.
   (c)   Widths. Proposed streets shall have a width meeting the requirements
set forth in the Subdivision Regulations, codified as Title Two of Part Twelve
- the Planning and Zoning Code.
   (d)   Alignment. Proposed alignment changes or deflections in street
direction shall be in accordance with the Subdivision Regulations.
   (e)   Grades. Proposed grades shall be the centerline grades of the
respective streets and shall be indicated in complete detail in the profiles
and referenced to the stationing shown on the plan. Maximum and minimum grades
to be adhered to are set forth in the Subdivision Regulations.
1022.03 CONSTRUCTION AND MATERIALS.
   (a)   Earthwork.
      (1)   Road excavations. The roadway shall be excavated to conform to the
cross sections shown on the plans. The subgrade shall be free of all foreign
material (grass, roots, grubs, etc.) before being shaped and rolled in
preparation for the base course. Soft and/or wet areas of the subgrade shall be
stabilized with stone and/or properly drained before preparation for the base
course is completed.
      (2)   Trench excavations. Excavations within a dedicated right-of-way for
sewers, water, gas or electrical conduits over five feet in depth shall be
shored or sheeted and braced in accordance with the latest edition of Chapter
IC - 3 of the State Department of Industrial Relations and/or O.S.H.A.
requirements relating to construction. Trenches shall be backfilled as follows:
         A.   Within a traveled roadway, trenches shall be backfilled with
granular material. Granular material shall meet the requirements set forth in
Section 203.02 of the O.D.T., except that slag and cinders shall not be used.
         B.   Outside the limits of a traveled roadway, trenches may be
backfilled with excavated materials. However, the trench shall be backfilled
with granular material to a point one foot above the top of the pipe or
conduit.
         C.   All backfill material shall be compacted by mechanical or other
approved means to the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) hereof.
      (3)   Embankment. Where a roadway, sidewalk or curb is built on a fill,
the same shall be constructed by placing approved fill material in maximum
eight inch lifts, as specified in this paragraph. From the surface of the
subgrade to a point two feet below the surface of the subgrade, the embankment
shall be compacted to at least ninety-five percent of the maximum density of
the material, based on optimum water content of the material (AASHO Designation
T-180-57 Method "C"), as determined by an independent testing laboratory, if
determined necessary by the Municipal Engineer. The remainder of the embankment
shall be compacted to at least ninety percent of the maximum density of the
material, based on optimum water content of the material (AASHO Designation T-
180-57 Method "C"), as determined by an independent testing laboratory, if
determined necessary by the Municipal Engineer. The location and number of
tests shall be determined by the Municipal Engineer.
The required test shall be paid for by the developer and additional tests may
be required if subsequent circumstances occur rendering such required test
inconclusive. Embankment shall be constructed according to the current
requirements of the O.D.T., except as specified in this paragraph.
   (b)   Aggregate Base Material, O.D.T. 304.
      (1)   Materials. Aggregate base material shall consist of crushed
limestone or crushed gravel composed of hard, durable particles of stone, shall
not contain vegetable matter, refuse, clay balls or other deleterious material
and shall be of such quality that it will compact thoroughly when watered and
rolled to form a well bonded base. The mineral aggregate shall be of such size
that the percentage composition by weight, as determined by laboratory sieves,
shall conform to the following graduation:
 
   Sieve SizPercent By Weight Passing
2"             100
1"             70-90
3/4"           50-85
No. 4          25-60
No. 40         7-30
No. 200        0-15
 
When the mineral aggregate does not contain sufficient binder material to bond
properly under the action of water and rolling, there shall be added to and
incorporated in it a cementacious binder material of such size that it will
pass a No. 4 sieve.
      (2)   Placing. The crushed aggregate base course shall be spread on a
prepared subgrade in layers as indicated on the drawing set forth in subsection
(h) hereof. Depositing and spreading the material on the roadbed shall commence
at the point farthest from the point of loading and shall progress continuously
without breaks. Dumping in piles on the subgrade is not permitted. The material
shall be spread from the vehicle by approved spreading device or tailgated to
the approval of the Municipal Engineer. The material shall be further spread by
blading with a heavy blade grader with a wheel base not less than fifteen feet
long. Each layer shall be thoroughly compacted as required under Item 304.04.
When the surface stability of the base cannot be obtained due to lack of fines,
crushed fines produced from stone, gravel or slag shall be added to the upper
portion of the course in an amount sufficient to secure surface stability.
However, in no case shall the quantity of fines added be sufficient to increase
the percent passing the No. 200 sieve to more than ten percent in the upper
portion.
      (3)   Compaction. Rolling of the material in each layer with an eight to
ten-ton power roller or a pneumatic tired roller shall commence immediately
after it has been spread in the roadbed.
Rolling shall commence at the outer edge of each course and progress toward the
center.
In narrow base widening areas or other areas inaccessible to the rollers
specified in this paragraph, the necessary compaction shall be done with a
trench roller or by hand tamping.
The aggregate base shall be rolled until it is thoroughly compacted and true to
grade and cross section. Whenever directed by the Municipal Engineer,
additional water shall be applied during the rolling.
Ruts, holes, defects or soft yielding places which occur in the subgrade by
reason of improper drainage conditions, traffic or hauling over the same, or
from any other cause, shall be corrected and rolled until firm and smooth
before the aggregate base is placed thereon.
   (c)   Bituminous Tack and Prime Coats.
      (1)   Materials. Bituminous materials shall meet the requirements of the
O.D.T., Section 702, as follows:
          A.   Tack coat used on existing paved surfaces shall be 702.02, RC-70
or RC-250 in the amount shown on the drawing set forth in subsection (h)
hereof.
         B.   Prime coat used on the aggregate base course shall be 702.09, RT-
2 or RT-3 in the amount shown on such drawing.
      (2)   Equipment. All equipment, tools, machinery, etc., shall be subject
to the approval of the Municipal Engineer and shall be maintained in a
satisfactory working condition at all times.
A bituminous distributor shall have pneumatic tires of such width and number
that the load produced on the base surface does not exceed 650 pounds per inch
of tire width. The distributor shall be so designed and equipped as to
distribute the bituminous material uniformly at even heat on variable widths of
surface at readily determined and controlled ranges of from one-tenth to two
gallons per square yard.
Distributor equipment shall include an independently operated bitumin pump, a
tachometer, a pressure gauge, a volume measuring device, a thermometer for
reading the temperature of the contents of the tank and a hose attachment for
applying bituminous material to spots unavoidably missed by the distributor.
The distributor shall be equipped for circulation and agitation of the
bituminous material during the heating process. The distributor shall be
equipped with an approved heating system consisting of heat flues having
sufficient radiation to ensure the rapid circulation of hot gasses from the
burners. The burners shall be smokeless and of the torch generating type.
      (3)   Weather limitations. No bituminous material shall be placed when
weather conditions are such that proper spreading, finishing and bonding may
not be obtained. Temperature requirements may be waived, but only when so
directed by the Municipal Engineer, and only to the extent that they do not
exceed those limitations as outlined in O.D.T., Sections 407.05 and 408.04.
      (4)   Protection of structures. The contractor shall exercise care to
protect the surface of curbs, gutters and other concrete work from being
unnecessarily marred during the application of bituminous materials.
      (5)   Application of bituminous material. The application of the
bituminous material shall be by means of a pressure distributor of an approved
type, as specified in this subsection, and at the temperature specified. The
material shall be so applied that uniform distribution is obtained at all
points of the surface to be treated. All spots unavoidably missed by the
distributor shall be properly treated with bituminous material. Following the
application of material, the surface shall be allowed to dry for not less than
twenty-four hours without being disturbed, or for such additional period of
time as may be necessary to secure penetration into the foundation course and
drying out or evaporation of the volatiles from the material, which period
shall be determined by the Municipal Engineer.
   (d)   Seal Coat, O.D.T. 409.
      (1)   Materials. Materials shall meet the requirements of the O.D.T.,
Sections 702 and 703, or the following:
         A.   Bituminous material to be used on existing paved surfaces shall

set forth in subsection (h) hereof.
      (2)   Equipment. All equipment, tools, machinery, etc., shall be subject
to the approval of the Municipal Engineer and shall be maintained in
satisfactory working condition at all times.
The bituminous distributor shall have pneumatic tires of such width and number
that the load produced on the base surface does not exceed 650 pounds per inch
of tire width. The distributor shall be so designed and equipped as to
distribute the bituminous material uniformly at even heat on variable widths of
surface at readily determined and controlled ranges of from one-tenth to two
gallons per square yard.
Distributor equipment shall include an independently operated bitumin pump, a
tachometer, a pressure gauge, a volume measuring device, a thermometer for
reading the temperature of the contents of the tank and a hose attachment for
applying bituminous material to spots unavoidably missed by the distributor.
The distributor shall be equipped for circulation and agitation of the
bituminous material during the heating process. The distributor shall be
equipped with an approved heating system consisting of heat flues having
sufficient radiation to ensure the rapid circulation of hot gasses from the
burners. The burners shall be smokeless and of the torch generating type.
      (3)   Weather limitations. No bituminous material shall be placed when
weather conditions are such that proper spreading, finishing and bonding may
not be obtained. Temperature requirements may be waived, but only when so
directed by the Municipal Engineer, and to the extent that they do not exceed
the limitations outlined in O.D.T., Section 409.04.
       (4)   Protection of structures. The contractor shall exercise care to
protect the surface of curbs, gutters and other concrete work from being
unnecessarily marred during the application of bituminous materials.
      (5)   Application of bituminous material. The application of the
bituminous material shall be by means of a pressure distributor of an approved
type, as specified in this subsection, and at the temperature specified. The
material shall be so applied that uniform distribution is obtained at all
points of the surface to be treated. All spots unavoidably missed by the
distributor shall be properly treated with bituminous material. Following the
application of the bituminous material, the cover aggregate shall be applied
uniformly without ridges or laps at the specified rate, adjusted as directed by
the Municipal Engineer, to produce a minimum of excess loose particles.
Spreading shall be accomplished in such a manner that the tires of the truck or
aggregate spreader at no time make contact with the uncovered or newly applied
bituminous material.
   (e)   Asphalt Concrete, O.D.T. 404.
      (1)   Material. Asphaltic concrete shall meet the requirements of O.D.T.,
Item 404, Asphalt Concrete.

course, no vehicular traffic shall be permitted on the pavement until it has
cooled sufficiently, and in no case in less than four hours, when normal summer
temperatures prevail.
   (f)   Aggregate Berm Material, O.D.T. 411.
      (1)   Materials. Aggregate berm material shall consist of crushed
limestone or crushed gravel composed of hard, durable particles of stone, shall
not contain vegetable matter, refuse, clay balls or other deleterious material
and shall be of such quality that it will compact thoroughly when watered and
rolled to form a well bonded base. The mineral aggregate shall be of such size
that the percentage composition by weight, as determined by laboratory sieves,
shall conform to the following graduation:
 
Sieve Sizes Percent By Weight Passing
2"          100
1"          75-100
No. 4       25-60
No. 40      7-30
No. 200     0-15
 
All material retained on the No. 4 mesh sieve and larger shall be forty percent
crushed.
When the mineral aggregate does not contain sufficient binder material to bond
properly under the action of water and rolling, there shall be added to and
incorporated in it a cementacious binder material of such size that it will
pass a No. 4 sieve.
      (2)   Placing. The crushed aggregate berm material shall be spread on a
prepared subgrade as indicated on the drawing set forth in subsection (h)
hereof. Depositing and spreading the material on the roadbed shall progress
continuously without breaks. Dumping in piles on the subgrade is not permitted.
The material shall be spread from the vehicle by approved spreading devices or
tailgated to the approval of the Municipal Engineer. The material shall be
further spread by blading with a heavy blade grader. Each layer shall be
thoroughly compacted as required under Item 411.03.
When the surface stability of the crushed aggregate cannot be obtained due to
lack of fines, crushed fines produced from stone, gravel or slag shall be added
to the upper portion of the course in an amount sufficient to secure surface
stability. However, in no case shall the quantity of fines added be sufficient
to increase the percent passing the No. 200 sieve to more than fifteen percent
in the upper portion.
      (3)   Compacting. Rolling of the material with an eight to ten-ton power
roller or a pneumatic tired roller shall commence immediately after it has been
spread on the sub-base.
Rolling shall commence at the outer edge of each course and progress toward the
center.
In narrow base widening areas or other areas inaccessible to the rollers
specified in this paragraph, the necessary compaction shall be done with a
trench roller or by hand tamping.
The aggregate base shall be rolled until it is thoroughly compacted and true to
grade and cross section. Whenever directed by the Municipal Engineer,
additional water shall be applied during the rolling, care being taken not to
soften the subgrade.
Ruts, holes, defects or soft yielding places which occur in the subgrade by
reason of improper drainage conditions, traffic or hauling over the same, or
from any other cause, shall be corrected and rolled until firm and smooth
before the aggregate base is placed thereon.
   (g)   Portland Cement Concrete Work.
      (1)   Cement. The cement used shall be one or more of the following
types, as approved by the Municipal Engineer:
         A.   Normal Portland cement shall conform to the Standard
Specifications for Portland Cement of the American Society for Testing
Materials (C150-41).
         B.   High-early-strength Portland cement shall conform to the Standard
Specifications of the American Society for Testing Materials (C-50 -41).
         C.   Air entraining Portland cement shall conform to Tentative
Specifications for Air Entraining Portland Cement of the American Society for
Testing Materials (C175-44T).
         D.   Either cement may be used, at the option of the contractor, but
only one brand, grade or kind of cement shall be used in a given structure
above the ground line, except upon written permission of the Municipal
Engineer.
      (2)   Water. Water shall be clean and potable.
      (3)   Aggregates generally. In no case will the use of pit run or
naturally mixed aggregates be permitted. Naturally mixed aggregates shall, in
every case, be screened and washed and all fine and coarse aggregates shall be
stored separately and kept clean.
      (4)   Coarse aggregate. Coarse aggregate shall consist of crushed stone,
gravel or other inert materials having similar characteristics, subject to the
approval of the Municipal Engineer. The particular type to be furnished shall
be approved by the Municipal Engineer.
      (5)   Fine aggregate. Fine aggregate shall consist of natural sand, sand
prepared from the product obtained by crushing stone, gravel or other inert
materials having similar characteristics, subject to the approval of the
Municipal Engineer. The particular type to be furnished shall be approved by
the Municipal Engineer.
      (6)   Mixing, Conveying and Placing.
         A.   Mixing. At the option of the contractor, mixing may be
accomplished by the use of modern, efficient, mechanical equipment on the job,
at a central mixing plant or in transit. The type and capacity of the plant
shall be subject to the approval of the Municipal Engineer. Unless otherwise
permitted by the Municipal Engineer, materials shall be measured by weighing,
except that sacked cement need not be weighed and water may be measured by
volume. The weight of one sack of cement shall be taken as ninety- four pounds
and the weight of one gallon of water as 8.33 pounds. The accuracy of all
measuring devices shall be such that all quantities can be measured to within
one percent of the desired amount. With any method of mixing, the speed of
mixer drums and the volume of the mixed material per batch shall not exceed
those recommended by the manufacturer for maximum efficiency.
The minimum time for mixing each batch, after all materials are in the mixer,
shall be one minute.
Truck mixers shall be of the revolving drum type, watertight and so constructed
that the concrete can be mixed to ensure a uniform distribution of materials
throughout the mass. Each batch shall be mixed not fewer than fifty and not
more than 150 revolutions of the drum, at the rate of rotation specified by the
manufacturer as mixing speed. Any additional mixing shall be done at the slower
speed specified by the manufacturer for agitation.
         B.   Conveying. The concrete shall be conveyed from mixer to forms as
rapidly as practical by methods which will positively prevent the segregation
or loss of ingredients. When central plan mixing is permitted, concrete shall
be transported to the forms in agitating trucks. Use of chutes is permitted
only with the written permission of the Municipal Engineer. Retampering of
concrete which has partially hardened is not permitted.
         C.   Placing. Concrete shall be placed on a damp subgrade to prevent
loss of moisture. If the subgrade is dry, it shall be sprinkled well in advance
of placing the concrete with as much water as it will readily absorb. Concrete
shall not be placed on soft, muddy or frozen subgrade.
The concrete shall be well compacted and thoroughly worked into all corners and
angles of forms, around all embedded items and along all form surfaces to
secure smooth, even, finished surfaces, free from aggregate pockets or
honeycombs.
Concrete shall not be placed when the atmospheric temperature is below thirty-
two degrees Fahrenheit or when the concrete is likely to be subject to freezing
temperatures before final set has occurred, unless specifically authorized by
the Municipal Engineer in writing. When so authorized, the materials shall be
heated in order that the temperature of the concrete, when deposited, is not
less than fifty degrees Fahrenheit or more than eighty degrees Fahrenheit. All
methods and equipment for heating are subject to the approval of the Municipal
Engineer.
       (7)   Strength. It is anticipated that the following average strength
should be obtained with the mix specified:
         A.   Seven days - 2,800 pounds per square inch; and
         B.   Twenty-eight days-4,000 pounds per square inch.
      (8)   Finishing and curing. Unless otherwise specifically authorized by
the Municipal Engineer, the type and method of finishing and curing of the
various items of concrete work shall conform to the O.D.T.
      (9)   Joints. Joints in concrete work shall be constructed in conformity
with the details shown on the drawings. Joints shall be constructed in the
locations indicated on the drawing set forth in subsection (h) hereof, as
directed by the Municipal Engineer.
      (10)   Forms. Construction forms shall be set true to line and grade and
shall be well supported throughout so that there will be no sagging, twisting
or bending. Forms shall have a depth equal to the thickness of the concrete at
the edge. When set to grade, the maximum deviation of the top of the forms from
a straight line shall not exceed one-eighth of an inch in ten feet and shall be
so maintained until the concrete has set. The type of form and method of
support are subject to the approval of the Municipal Engineer.
Coating forms shall be coated with nonstaining mineral oil, which shall be
applied shortly before the concrete is placed.
Forms shall be removed in such a manner as will prevent injury to the concrete.

(Ord. 18-02. Passed 4-23-02.)
1030.04 PROCEDURE FOR PERMITS; TERMS.
   (a)   Applicants for franchise permits shall be granted a franchise permit
hereunder which shall be valid so long as the franchise is valid and the
applicable provisions of that franchise and of this chapter are complied with;
provided, however, that a franchise permit shall only entitle the franchise
permittee to utilize the rights of way, in accordance with this chapter, for
purposes directly related to the provision of the specific services for which
it has a specific franchise. Any other right of way use by such permittee shall
require a separate permit of another available type, as outlined in Section
1030.03, which shall be granted upon application and compliance with the terms
and standards required.
   (b)   Applicants for general permits, or renewals thereof, shall file an
application therefore, in such form as the regulations require, along with an
application fee as also set forth in the regulations (which may contain
disparate fees, for initial permits and renewal permits). The Director shall
determine if the application is in order and, if so, make a recommendation to
Council as to whether or not, in accordance with the criteria set forth in
Section
1030.05, the applicant should be granted a permit hereunder. Council shall then
consider such recommendation and make a final determination as to whether or
not such permit should be granted and if so, upon what terms and conditions.
The term of such permit shall be for five years. Any person proposing to
operate an open video system (OVS) shall be required to obtain a general
permit.
   (c)   Applicants for special permits, or renewals thereof, shall file an
application therefor, in such form as the regulations require, along with an
application fee as also set forth in the regulations (which may require
disparate fees for initial permits and renewal permits). The Director shall
determine if the application is in order and if so, and if the Director also
finds, in accordance with the criteria set forth in Section
1030.05 that the application should be granted, the Director shall
conditionally grant or renew such a permit. Such conditional special permit
shall become final unless modified or rejected by Council within thirty days of
issuance by the Director. The term of such permits shall be two years unless
the applicant requests a lesser term.
   (d)   Permits for residential related purposes are not required, with the
stipulations that such uses:
      (1)   Exist and continue at the sufferance of the Municipality;
      (2)   May not jeopardize or adversely affect the public health, welfare,
morals or safety;
      (3)   May not interfere with the Municipality's own uses of the rights of
way;
      (4)   Must be modified, moved or removed, upon notice, when the
Municipality determines in its sole judgment that such action is necessary;
provided further, that in an emergency, or upon failure of the responsible
party to respond in a timely fashion, the Municipality may do or contract to do
whatever it requires and recover the costs of same as such costs are
recoverable by law.
   (e)   Any applicant may appeal the failure of the Director to grant a permit
or to recommend it to be granted upon terms and conditions acceptable to the
applicant. In order to perfect such appeal, the applicant shall file, within
ten days of the Director's determination or recommendation or ninety days of
the filing of the application if the Director has taken no action, an appeal to
Council. Council shall then review the matter and render a final determination
after affording the applicant an opportunity to be heard either in person or in
writing. Except to the extent otherwise appealable by law, Council's decision
shall be final.
   (f)   Permittee shall, within thirty days of the initial granting of any
permit hereunder, pay a pro rata portion of the fees required by Section
1030.07 as applicable.
(Ord. 18-02. Passed 4-23-02.)
1030.05 CRITERIA FOR GRANTING PERMITS.
   (a)   Franchise permits shall be granted to all persons holding a valid
franchise and shall be effective for so long as such franchise is valid and the
permittee complies with the provisions of such permit and this chapter.
   (b)   General and special permits shall be granted to persons based upon a
determination that the following criteria are met:
      (1)   The granting of the permit will contribute to the public health,
safety or welfare in the Municipality;

   (a)   When requested or petitioned, Council may proceed, according to law,
to extend any existing sewer district or to establish new districts where
necessary and to create new public water supplies and sanitary sewerage systems
or to extend the same to serve areas not already provided with water and/or
sewer service. The financing of any such additions or extensions may be
provided by:
      (1)   Revenue bonds, provided that, in the case of extending an existing
system, the additional revenue bonds can be issued in full compliance with the
terms of existing bond resolutions and trust agreements and further provided
that there is a market for such bonds;
      (2)   Special assessments or unit charges, levied against benefited
properties;
      (3)   General obligation revenue bonds;
      (4)   The improvement fund or surplus funds of the existing districts;
      (5)   Cash payments by benefited property owners; or
      (6)   Some combinations of the above, as determined by Council.
   Prior to petitioning Council to adopt legislation and to conduct public
hearings, as required by law, to proceed with the preparation of detailed plans
and specifications for construction of water or sewer improvements and the
preparation of property assessments, a petitioner shall deposit with the Water
Division and the Sewer Division the sum of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
to cover the cost of preparing the same. If a proposed project proceeds to
construction, the amount deposited shall be returned to the petitioner.
   (b)   Council, upon application by any individual, organization or agency of
private enterprise may, by resolution, grant permission to such individual,
organization or agency to construct, at its cost, water or sewer improvements
by private contract under the supervision of the Sanitary Engineer, as provided
for in Section
1032.11.
   (c)   All water supply or sanitary sewerage systems or extensions thereof
shall be constructed in accordance with the detailed plans and specifications
prepared by a professional engineer and approved by the Sanitary Engineer and
Council.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1032.11 PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION.
   (a)   Reimbursement of Original Cost.
      (1)   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 729, Council may, by resolution,
enter into a contract for the construction of water or sewer lines by an
individual, organization or agency of private enterprise (the "applicant").
Such resolution, and any contract entered into pursuant to such resolution (a
"reimbursement contract"), shall authorize the collection of prorated shares of
the original cost of such improvement (the "nonparticipant charge") as provided
by law. The information required to be included in the reimbursement contract
may be obtained from the Sanitary Engineer.
      (2)   Such resolution shall be filed by the applicant with the Director
of Finance, which filing shall constitute constructive notice thereof to
nonparticipants in the original cost of the improvement (the "nonparticipant").
      (3)   The nonparticipant charge shall be based upon the front footage
charge of the improvement to the nonparticipant and shall not be in excess of
the amount chargeable to such nonparticipant had he or she participated in the
original cost of such improvement. When construction has been completed, all
costs must be submitted by the applicant to the Sanitary Engineer for
verification and recommendation to Council for acceptance and approval,
including the determination of the nonparticipant charge.
      (4)   After the nonparticipant charge is determined, a description of the
properties abutting the improvement, the front footage and the amount to be
paid by each nonparticipant must be approved by resolution of Council and
certified to the Director of Finance for collection. Such approval shall not be
granted until the applicant has deposited with the Water Division and the Sewer
Division the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00) to cover the cost to the
Municipality of supervision of the legal proceedings incident to such
reimbursement.
      (5)   In any instance in which a connection is made to the improvement by
a nonparticipant, the Director of Finance shall collect the nonparticipant
charge for reimbursement to the applicant pursuant to the terms of the
reimbursement contract.
      (6)   The term of a reimbursement contract shall not exceed ten years.
      (7)   No subsequent assignee or grantee of the applicant shall be
considered a nonparticipant.
       (8)   Payment of the cost of construction or of the nonparticipant
charge does not constitute payment of a tap in charge or connection charge, as
prescribed in these Regulations, for the water supply or sewerage system to
which the extension is constructed. Tap-in or connection charges must be paid
by the property owner of each improved property when connection to the system
is made. Payment of the nonparticipant charge, however, does relieve the
property owner from payment of an equalization charge.
   (b)   Guarantees; Maintenance Bond. All water supply and sewerage facilities
constructed by the applicant shall be guaranteed against any and all defects of
workmanship and materials for a period of one year from the date of acceptance
by Council. The cost of all labor, materials, tools, equipment and incidentals
required to maintain, repair and replace any part of the improvement, including
streets or road repairs, trench maintenance and restoration of lawns,
driveways, walks, shrubs, etc., during the one-year guarantee period, shall be
assumed by the applicant. As a guarantee for payment of such cost, such
applicant shall remit to Council a maintenance bond in the amount of ten
percent of the construction cost and in a form satisfactory to Council. At the
end of the one-year period and at the written request of the applicant, the
Municipality will make a final inspection of the water supply or sewerage
facilities and if such improvements meet all applicable standards and
requirements of the Department of Service, the maintenance bond will be
released and the improvements accepted for maintenance and operation by the
Municipality.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1032.12 OVERSIZED FACILITIES.
   (a)   In some instances, Council, upon the recommendation of the Sanitary
Engineer, may determine that the size of the water supply or sewerage
facilities should be increased for future expansion. Such determination shall
be made upon the basis of the Land Use Plan of the Municipality.
   (b)   When it is determined that they are necessary, the oversized
facilities shall be installed by the developer.
   (c)   The Municipality may pay the difference in cost for the increased
size, in an amount to be determined by the Sanitary Engineer, from water and/or
sewer surplus funds and/or from the proceeds of certificates of indebtedness
authorized and issued by Council for such purpose.
   (d)   The Municipality will participate, upon recommendation of the Sanitary
Engineer pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, in the cost of oversizing water
mains in excess of eight inches in diameter and sewers in excess of ten inches
in diameter.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1032.13 AMENDMENTS.
   (a)   Generally. These Water and Sewer Regulations may be changed from time
to time to satisfy changing situations. Amendments, when accepted by Council,
will be made known to the public in the manner that ordinances and resolutions
are made known by Council.
    (b)   Procedures. Persons who desire to have amendments made to these Water
and Sewer Regulations shall submit their suggestions, in writing, to the
Manager. Upon receipt of such a written suggestion, the Manager and the
Sanitary Engineer shall review the suggestion for its merits and applicability.
If the Manager and the Sanitary Engineer deem the suggestion meritorious, it
shall be submitted to Council for review and approval.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1032.14 PERMITS AND APPROVALS REQUIRED; FALSIFICATION.
   No person shall tamper with or attempt to use facilities provided by the
Municipality without first obtaining the necessary permits and approvals. No
person shall obtain a permit or approval based upon a false statement made in
order to deceive the Municipality.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1032.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this
chapter is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) for each offense. A separate offense shall be deemed
committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance occurs or
continues.
   (b)   In addition to the penalty provided in subsection (a) hereof, whoever
violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
subject to revocation or suspension of permits and/or licenses granted
hereunder and, further, shall be liable and responsible for any and all damage
incurred as a result of such violation.

damage against the Municipality or any officer thereof for damage to any pipe,
fixture, or appurtenance by reason of interrupted water supply, or variation of
pressure, or for damage of any nature whatsoever caused by the turning off or
turning on, either wholly or partially, of the water supply for the extension,
alteration, or repair of any water main or premises supply, or for the
discontinuance of the premises' water supply for the violation of any
provisions contained in or authorized by this chapter. The Municipality will,
in case of an accident causing shortage or shut- off of the supply, endeavor to

exceptions are where circumstances exist that indicates it is not feasible, in
the opinion of the Service Director, to make such an installation. Remote
registers location on the structure shall be approved by the Municipality.
Remote registers may not be installed to relieve the owner of the
responsibility of placing the meter in a pit where required by regulation. The
Municipality shall not be responsible for the damage of property caused by
necessary holes, fastening or other work required for proper installation. The
Municipality will maintain remote registers under the same provisions as meters
are maintained.
   (l)   In the event of malfunction of the remote register, the inside reading
of the main meter shall prevail at all times, in addition if a meter fails to
register, or is found to be out of order, the customer will be charged at the
average consumption for comparable periods, as shown by the meter when in order
and registering accurately.
   (m)   Not more than one meter shall be used per premises serviced by a
single service except where it is desired to have tenants in multiple occupancy
on one premise metered separately for service provided by the Municipality, or
in the case of sprinkling systems. Where this separate metering is desired and
multiple occupancy units are involved, outside curb stops shall be required in
a location specified by the Municipality and a meter installed in each separate
unit. A remote reading register shall be required for each such meter. Any
deviation from this must be approved in writing by the Service Director after
plans are submitted showing locations of secondary curb stops.
   (n)   Auxiliary meters may be purchased and set by the owner of the
premises, at his own expense, wherever the owner wishes, for the purpose of
determining the amount of water used in certain areas of the premises. However,
the Municipality will not read these meters, nor be responsible in any way for
their accuracy or maintenance. Prior notification must be given to the
Municipality before any such action is taken.
   (o)   Threaded valves must be provided on both the inlet and outlet sides of
the meter and as close thereto as possible, in accordance with the Municipal
standards. These valves, which must be installed at the owner's expense, shall
be as follows:
      (1)   For service up to and including two inches (2"), the valve on the
inlet and outlet side shall be a ball type valve. The valves shall be the same
diameter as the service pipe which, in the case of the smallest service, is
required to be three-quarters of an inch (3/4"). Only brass valves and bushings
shall be used in the meter setting.
      (2)   For services four inches (4") and larger the valve on the inlet and
outlet side shall be of the gate type; either solid wedge or double disc with
nonrising stem, wheel pressures up to 150 pounds. The valve shall be the same
diameter as the service pipe.
   (p)   Meters are required to be set at a point on the incoming service pipe
as close as possible to the point of entry through the building or foundation
wall on the inside of the building. In buildings without basements, the meter
shall be set in a utility room or kitchen located adjacent to an outside door.
   (q)   Meters may be placed in an attached garage if heated; otherwise, they
must be placed in an insulated enclosure of a design approved by the Service
Director to prevent freezing.
   (r)   No one shall be permitted to install anything other than brass meter
connections approved by the Municipality.
   (s)   Where a building is located more than 150 feet from the property line,
or at the discretion of the Municipality the meter may be required to be
located in vault or meter pit in a Municipality approved location, at or near
the right of way or easement line. This pit or vault shall be of a type similar
and equal to Ford or Mueller meter box in use on small services. The pit shall
be kept accessible at all times, no obstruction shall be placed at any time on
the cover of such vaults or boxes and the covers shall also be kept free from
snow and ice. The vault cover shall be as specified by the Municipality. These
vaults shall be maintained in a manner so that the meter may be read and served
by employees of the Municipality. The property owner shall keep the meter pit
at grade with the ground surface. Failure to comply with this requirement shall
be cause for discontinuance of water service until such time as compliance is
affected. The property owner shall conform to any written instructions from the
Municipality as to the grade of meter pit, and the Municipality shall be
indemnified against any damages or expenses occasioned it because a meter pit
is above or below grade. All meter pits where authorized shall be owned and
maintained by the property owner in accordance with the Municipal
specifications, the cost of any repairs are at the property owners expense.
   (t)   Water meters for industrial or commercial nonsewered water usage, if
approved by the Municipality, shall be installed, repaired or replaced by the
property owner at his expense. The Municipality reserves the right to have the
meter tested for accuracy at any time at the property owner's expense.
   (u)   If the meter fails to register within the accuracy limitation
hereinafter prescribed, the test charge shall be canceled and credit for the
rate of over registration, for a period not exceeding one year prior to the
date of test, shall be entered on the water bill following the test. A meter
shall be considered accurate when registering within two percent plus or minus
the true amount of water delivered on the maximum flow of the water, and within
ten percent the true amount delivered on the minimum flow, for the size and
type of meter tested.
   (v)   Meters utilized by the Municipality whether owned by the Municipality,
or by the customer shall meet the accuracy specifications of the American Water
Works Association (AWWA). This shall apply both to new and to repaired meters.
   (w)   Permanent water supply for automatic sprinkler systems (private fire
protection service) may, when deemed advisable, be granted on an unmetered
basis in accordance with the rules herein. The general policy of the
Municipality is to have one meter for each separate service connection; if, in
the opinion of the Municipality, more than one meter is necessary to meter
water supply to a property, such as multi family units, the meter shall be set
in an area not under the control of any tenant and shall be accessible at all
times to utility personnel. Meters shall not be installed in such a manner as
to require subtraction of another's meter reading to determine usage for any
consumer.
   (x)   There shall be no appurtenances installed on any service connection
between the curb stop and the inlet valve of the water meter, except for branch
fire line connections that are likewise metered, either completely or by a
detector check assembly. Any necessary controls such as pressure reducers or
check valves shall be installed after the outlet valve of the water meter.
(Ord. 25-10. Passed 12-14-10.)
1034.15 METER TESTING.
   (a)   From time to time or upon request, the Municipality will test any of
its meters and guarantee its accuracy. When consumers are dissatisfied with
bills and request a test of the water meter, they shall make such a request in
writing and deposit with the request the amount as set forth in the General Fee
Schedule in Chapter
206. If, upon testing, the meter is found to be registering more water than
actually is passing through it, and the difference is in excess of the
tolerance permitted by the American Water Works Association Standards, no
charge shall be made, the deposit will be returned and the meter will be
replaced at no cost to the consumer and a credit for the rate of over
registration, for a period not exceeding a three month billing period prior to
the date of test, shall be entered on the water bill following the test may be
considered by the Finance Director. Otherwise, the owner or his agent shall
forfeit the deposit.
   (b)   If a tested meter, regardless of who initiates the request for such
testing, reveals damage resulting from neglect or carelessness of the property
owner, his agent or tenant, the total cost associated with the meter testing
and its subsequent repair or replacement shall be borne by the property owner.
   (c)   Water meter testing shall be done by the Municipality or by the
manufacturer's representative and the results of all tests shall be certified
in writing to the property owner along with the assessment of applicable
charges.
(Ord. 25-10. Passed 12-14-10.)
1034.16 SPECIAL WATER METERS.
   (a)   Upon issuance of a permit by the Department of Service, water may be
taken from fire hydrants fitted with special gate valves and meters. Prior to
the issuance of such permit, a hydrant meter deposit must be posted. The holder
of the permit shall be responsible for the hydrant and meter and shall pay the
fees and charges provided for in Chapter
1040.
   (b)   A consumer may purchase from the Municipality a second water meter for
uses outside the house, such as lawn and garden watering and swimming pools,
and for purposes where water does not enter into the sanitary sewer, and if
water used for the above purposes is not discharged into the sewer system, no
sewer service charge will be rendered upon this separate use of water. The
special water meter must be installed pursuant to the specifications of the
Municipality. The consumer must bear the full cost of such meter installation,
and all fees and charges provided for in Chapter
1040 are applicable.

   (b)   The Service Director is the person responsible for maintenance and
repairs of fire hydrants and, as such, is the only one with the authority to
shut off and turn on service to any fire hydrant. The only exception to the
authority to turn on and shut off fire hydrants is the authority of the Fire
Chief to authorize turning on or off service or ordering the diverting water to
more effectively fight a fire. Violators of this provision shall be subject to
a damages charge as well as being liable to prosecution under both Municipal
and Ohio law.
   (c)   No person, except an authorized agent of a fire department or the
Municipality, or a permit holder during the term and at the location of the
hydrant for which permit has been issued; shall make use of a fire hydrant. At
the discretion of the Municipality, a special permit may be issued for the use
of a fire hydrant for securing a supply of water for construction or other
special purposes where a permanent supply or connection shall not be required.
Upon issuance of a permit by the Municipality, water may be taken from fire
hydrants fitted with special gate valves and meter supplied and installed by
the Municipality. Prior notification of twenty four hours is needed to assure
availability of personnel and the meter. Prior to the issuance of such permit,
a hydrant meter deposit must be posted. The holder of the permit shall be
responsible for the hydrant and meter and shall pay the fees and charges
provided for in Chapter
1040. Any damage incurred by the meter shall be the responsibility of the
permit holder and paid to the Municipal Utility Office upon billing to effect
repair to the meter, normal wear excepted. Violators of this provision shall be
subject to a damages charge as well as being liable to prosecution under both
Municipal and Ohio law.
   (d)   If a fire hydrant is damaged by any person, intentionally or
unintentionally, such person or persons shall be responsible for all costs and
expenses incurred by the Municipality in making the necessary repairs and
corrections.
   (e)   All fire hydrants will be as specified by the Municipality. No private
fire hydrant shall be set without the inspection and approval of the
Municipality. All fire hydrants shall have watch valves and shall not be
installed on water lines smaller than six inches. Location of hydrants shall be
approved by the Municipality. Fire hydrants shall be furnished by the developer
or the owner.
   (f)   Whenever it becomes necessary to shut off service to any fire hydrant
or whenever service to any fire hydrant is turned back on after having been
shut off, the person ordering the action shall notify the Municipal
Administration and Fire Department as soon as possible, but not later than
twelve hours after such act. Failure to report such fact to the persons
mentioned within the twelve hour limit may be considered a neglect of duty on
the part of that person and thereby may subject him to disciplinary action,
including dismissal.
   (g)   Fire service connections may be made upon submission of a written
application for such service and upon approval of the plans for such connection
by the Municipality.
   (h)   Private fire service inside buildings shall be dry type or wet type

interior fire service cannot proceed until plans therefore have been filed with
the Municipality and written permission for construction thereof has been
received.
   (i)   Each housing, business or commercial unit having privately owned and
maintained fire service mains and hydrants shall be charged an availability fee
for such service as provided for in Chapter
1040.
   (j)   The following standard minimum size mains shall be used for hydrant
supply for all construction:
      (1)   For residential districts, eight inch (8"), except that a six inch
(6") main can be used where it completes a good gridiron, but in no case in
blocks 400 feet or more in length; and
      (2)   For commercial and industrial zoning districts, eight inch (8") and
twelve inch (12"), the smaller size main to be used only in sections where it
completes a good gridiron and the larger size main to be used for long lines
not cross connected. Hydrant spacing in such districts shall not exceed 300
feet between hydrants.
   (k)   A fire service branch from the main shall not be used for other than
fire fighting purposes. It shall be the responsibility of the owners of the
property served, or their agents, to obtain permission from the Municipality in
advance for using water from a fire protection service for any purposes,
including fire drills and pressure testing of a protection system.
   (l)   No application for fire protections service branch shall be accepted
which has a carrying capacity of more than fifty percent of the carrying
capacity of the water main to which it is connected.
   (m)   There shall be no charge for water used for firefighting purposes.
   (n)   All fire protection systems shall have a backflow prevention device
installed within the system. The type of backflow preventer and location shall
be shown on the plans and approved by the Municipality.
   (o)   Fire service lines when used only for furnishing water for fighting
fires either through private hydrants or a sprinkler system, are required to be
metered but will not be charged for usage in the event of a fire. The plans
shall show projected flow rates for the fire protection system and the
estimated size of meter needed.
   (p)   No changes, alterations or extensions of any fire protection system
shall be made without first securing approval from the Municipality.
Application for same shall be made in writing prior to starting work.

   (r)   The Municipality will not be responsible for the furnishing and
maintaining of any set amount of water at a given pressure or for the lack of
service on limited fire service.
   (s)   If at any time a fire protection system is found to be in violation of
any of the Municipality's "Rules and Regulations," all changes necessary to
make said systems comply therewith must be made within thirty days after
written notice to do so. A copy of the written notice will be sent to the
interested insurance company, if known. Failure to comply as directed will
result in discontinuance of service after a five day period.
   (t)   The use of drip or blow off valves for draining fire services shall be
allowed only in cases of absolute necessity, and in no case shall their
installation be permitted unless furnished with a valve, which shall be
approved and sealed by the Municipality, and the end of every such pipe shall
be exposed to view at all times. The size of drip or blow off pipes shall be as
approved by the Municipality in each case.
   (u)   Before water service will be furnished to a private fire protection
system, a pressure test satisfactory to the Municipality shall be made by the
contractor and witnessed by a Municipal inspector. This test shall include all
underground piping from the tapping valve to the building being served. After a
satisfactory pressure test has been completed, two consecutive, passing
bacteriological tests shall be made by the owner, at his expense, and they
shall meet all drinking water standards prior to any water being supplied
through this service.
(Ord. 25-10. Passed 12-14-10.)
1034.18 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR.
   (a)   The Municipality reserves the right to shut off the water supply
without notice in case of accidents or causes beyond its control, or for making
repairs, connections or replacements, and shall not be held responsible in any
manner for any consequences of such shut off. The Municipality will give
notice, so far as is practical, of any shut off of any water supply, but
nothing in this chapter shall require the giving of such notice. The
Municipality will, in no way, be responsible for any water damage or for the
loss of water on account of fixtures having been left open when water is
ordered on at any service.
   (b)   The Municipality shall maintain all water mains on dedicated public
easements or rights-of-way. No maintenance will be performed on water mains
that do not lie within public easements or dedicated rights-of-way. These lines
shall be maintained by the owners and, in the event of problems, service shall
be discontinued until repairs have been completed to the satisfaction of the
Department of Service.
   (c)   If a break or leak occurs in any service lateral between the water
main and the curb stop, the Municipality will repair this at its own expense as
soon as possible. The owner will be required to pay all costs of repair to the
water service lateral on his or her property from the curb stop to the
structure.
   (d)   If a water service lateral from the water main to a curb stop is
severed, the contractor shall be responsible for all costs associated with the
repair or installation of a new water service lateral, the water lost and the
expenses incurred by the Municipality as a result of the damaged lateral.
(Ord. 25-10. Passed 12-14-10.)
1034.19 TAMPERING WITH SYSTEM.
   (a)   No person other than an authorized agent of the Municipality shall
connect to any portion of the water supply system, tamper with or remove any
meter, seal or part thereof, or insert a meter by pass, without permission of
the Department of Service. Tampering is defined as provided in this section as
any attempt by an individual to mechanically influence the proper functioning
of a water meter, whether sealed or unsealed, for the purpose of gaining a
benefit such as a lowered utility charge, and includes breaking the seal on a
sealed water meter. Any of the above constitutes a tampering violation, which
carries the penalty provided in Section
1034.99, and also constitutes due cause for discontinuance of water service.
   (b)   If the Municipality finds that a meter seal has been broken, a
connection has been installed ahead of the meter, a by pass has been inserted
or that there is evidence that a meter has been tampered with, the water will
be shut off and will not be turned on again until the consumer or owner of the
premises pays for the estimated quantity of water which has been used and not
registered and, in addition, pays a fee for turning on the water. The criminal
laws of the State and the Municipality provide severe penalties for tampering
with water meters, meter seals, valves and other devices in the system. The
penalties herein provided are in addition to the penalties provided by the
criminal laws of the State and the Municipality, and the payment of penalties
herein provided for will not in any way relieve any person from prosecution for
violations of such laws.
   (c)   No person shall unlawfully secure a supply of water through a
corporation stop, curb stop, valve or other device after it has been closed due
to a violation of any of these Water and Sewer Regulations, without first
securing the necessary permit from the Municipality.
   (d)   No person shall remove the cover of any public or private cock, meter
box, or valve box, or place any dirt, stones or other obstructions in such
boxes, or commit any act tending to obstruct the use thereof, or shall in any
manner deface or injure any hydrant, building, machinery, pipe, apparatus,
tools or fixtures of the waterworks.
   (e)   The Manager reserves the right to decide what shall constitute waste
or improper use of water when it is deemed necessary.
   (f)   The Service Director shall be responsible to alert the appropriate
officials concerning all cases of suspected tampering.
(Ord. 25-10. Passed 12-14-10.)
1034.20 GUARANTEE OF SUPPLY.

pressure of water but will, in the case of interruption of service, endeavor to
notify affected consumers.
   (b)   Persons or entities who or which maintain operations dependent upon a
continuous supply or fixed pressure of water should maintain a sufficient
storage of water to operate for a reasonable length of time. The length of time
of such storage capacity must be determined by the user for his or her specific
needs.
   (c)   In the case of a serious fire or a water shortage, or when for any
cause it is necessary to conserve the water supply by limiting the use thereof,
such an order shall be made by the Municipality and shall be obeyed by all
consumers of water affected by such order. The Municipality shall not be
responsible for any damage resulting from any such limited use.
(Ord. 25-10. Passed 12-14-10.)
1034.21 GUARANTEE OF SERVICE.
   (a)   Temporary shutdowns of the water supply by the Municipality may be
necessary for improvements or repairs. Whenever possible, and as time permits,
all consumers will be notified prior to the interruption. Should an
interruption occur, every reasonable effort will be made to restore service
within a reasonable length of time.
   (b)   The Municipality hereby expressly disclaims any responsibility or
liability for damage caused by, or arising from, any interruption of water
service.
(Ord. 25-10. Passed 12-14-10.)
1034.22 WASTING WATER.
Water is a precious commodity which is made available by the Municipality for
the purpose of preserving and promoting the public health and welfare and of
providing fire protection. No person shall deliberately waste water by allowing
it to flow from any hydrant or faucet which is connected to the public water
supply such water is not being used.
(Ord. 25-10. Passed 12-14-10.)
1034.23 BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES.
   (a)   No person shall install or maintain a water service connection to any
premises where an actual or potential cross connection to the Municipal water
system may exist, unless such actual or potential cross connections are abated
or controlled to the satisfaction of the Municipality and by the Ohio EPA.
   (b)   If, in the judgment of the Municipality, an approved backflow
prevention device is necessary for the safety of the public water system, the
Municipality will give notice to the water consumer to install such an approved
device immediately. The water consumer shall, at his or her own expense,
install such an approved device at a location and in a manner approved by the
Municipality, and shall have inspections and tests made of such approved
devices as required by the Municipality. The Municipality may assess fees
associated with the annual notification of testing to the consumer, for each
device, as may be reasonable, to cover the costs associated with implementing a
comprehensive cross connection control program.
   (c)   No person shall establish or permit to be established or maintain or
permit to be maintained any connection whereby a private, auxiliary or
emergency water supply, other than the regular public water supply of the
Municipality, may enter the supply or distribution system of the Municipality,
unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and the method of
connection and use of such supply has been approved by the Manager and by the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
   (d)   The Municipality shall cause surveys and investigations to be made of
industrial and other properties served by the public water supply where actual
or potential hazards to the public water supply may exist. Such surveys and
investigations shall be made a matter of public record and shall be repeated as
often as the Municipality deems necessary.
   (e)   The Municipality or its duly authorized representative shall have the
right to enter, at any reasonable time, any property served by a connection to
the public water supply or distribution system of the Municipality, for the
purpose of inspecting the piping system or systems thereof. Upon demand, the
owners, lessees or occupants of any property so served shall furnish to the
Municipality any information which it may request regarding the piping system
or systems of water use on such property. The refusal of such information, when
demanded, shall, within the discretion of the Municipality, be deemed evidence
of the presence of improper connections as provided in this section.
   (f)   The Municipality is hereby authorized and directed to discontinue,
after providing reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the water service to
any property wherein any connection in violation of the provisions of this
section is known to exist, and to take such other precautionary measures as it
may deem necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water
supply distribution mains. Water service to such property shall not be restored
until such conditions have been eliminated or corrected in compliance with the
provisions of this section.

create an actual or potential hazard to a public water system, including
premises having sources or systems containing process waters or fluids or
waters originating from a public water system which are no longer under the
control of the Municipality;
      (3)   Premises having internal cross connections that, in the judgment of
the Municipality, are not correctable, or intricate plumbing arrangements which
make it impracticable to determine whether or not cross connections exist;
      (4)   Premises where, because of security requirements or other
prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a
complete cross connection survey;
      (5)   Premises having a repeated history of cross connections being
established or re established; and
      (6)   Others specified by the Municipality or the Director of the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency.
   (j)   An approved backflow prevention device shall be installed on each
service line to a consumer's water system serving, but not necessarily limited
to, the following types of facilities:
      (1)   Hospitals, mortuaries, clinics, nursing homes;
      (2)   Laboratories;
      (3)   Piers, docks, waterfront facilities;

1036.03 PRETREATMENT.
   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to
the sanitary sewers which contain the substances or possess the characteristics
set forth in Section
1036.02 and which may have a deleterious effect upon the treatment facilities,
processes, equipment or receiving waters or which otherwise create a hazard to
life or constitute a public nuisance, the Municipality may:
   (a)   Reject the waste;
   (b)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the
sanitary sewers and require payment to cover the added cost of handling and
treating these wastes; or
   (c)   Charge users contributing extra-strength wastes for the additional
cost of treating such wastes.
   The design and installation of pretreatment facilities shall be subject to
the review and approval of the Sanitary Engineer and to the requirements of all
applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1036.04 CONTROL MANHOLES.
   When required by the Municipality, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying other than residential wastes shall install a suitable
control manhole, together with such meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer necessary to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of
wastes. Such manhole shall be readily accessible, safely and located and
constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Department of Service.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1036.05 TESTING.
   (a)   All measurements, tests or analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in the current edition of Standard
Methods for the Examination of Water and Waste Water, published by the American
Public Health Association, shall be determined at the control manhole provided
or upon suitable samples taken at such control manhole provided or upon
suitable samples taken at such control manhole. If no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be a downstream manhole in
the public sewer nearest to the point at which the building sewer is connected.
Sampling shall be carried out by methods customarily accepted to reflect to
effect of constituents upon the sewerage facilities and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, health and property. The particular application
involved will determine whether a twenty-our hour composite of the discharge is
appropriate or whether a grab sample should be taken. In most cases,
biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids analyses are obtained from
twenty-four hour composites of the discharge, and pH is determined from
periodic grab samples.
   (b)   A monthly report of the quantity and characteristics of any industrial
waste discharged into the sanitary sewer shall be presented to the Sanitary
Engineer by the owner no later than the fifteenth day of the month following
the reporting period.
   (c)   It is not the intent of any statement contained herein to prevent any
special agreement between the Municipality and any consumer of the sanitary
sewerage system who discharges a waste of unusual strength or character and
subject to special payment to the Municipality by such consumer for the
treatment of such waste and whose payment is proportionate to costs consistent
with rates determined by the Miami Conservancy District.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1036.06 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR.

may be necessary for improvements or repairs. Whenever possible, and as time
permits, all consumers will be notified prior to such interruption.
   (b)   The Municipality shall maintain all sewers in dedicated public
easements or rights of way. No maintenance will be performed on sanitary sewers
that do not lie within public easements or dedicated rights of way. Such sewers
shall be maintained by the owner and, in the event of problems, service shall
be discontinued until repairs have been completed to the satisfaction of the
Water Division and the Sewer Division.
   (c)   The Municipality will perform all maintenance of the public sanitary
sewers. The property owner will be held responsible for the maintenance of the
building sewer. The Municipality may require the property owner to make any
repairs to or perform any maintenance on the building sewer that the
Municipality deems necessary for the proper functioning of the sanitary
sewerage system. If the Municipality is called upon or finds it necessary to
repair or maintain any building connection, the cost of such repair or
maintenance shall be billed directly to the property owner.
   (d)   The Municipality expressly disclaims any responsibility for damage
caused by, or arising from, any stoppage of the public sanitary sewerage
systems.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1036.07 TAMPERING WITH SYSTEM.
   (a)   No person other than an authorized agent of the Municipality shall
attempt to make any type of connection to the sanitary sewerage system without
permission of the Water Division and the Sewer Division. To do so shall
constitute a tampering violation, which carries the penalty provided in Section
642.26 of these Codified Ordinances, and shall also constitute due cause for
discontinuance of sewer service.
   (b)   No act shall be permitted that would hamper or restrict in any way the
normal function of the sanitary sewerage system.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)

1036.10 SPECIAL WATER METERS.
   Consumers in certain water and sanitary sewer service areas who use large
amounts of water for lawn sprinkling, air conditioning, car washing, etc., may
realize some savings in sewer charges by having a separate meter installed to
measure such water usage. When sewer service charges are based upon the amount
of water consumed and if water used for the above purposes is not discharged
into the sewer system, no sewer service charge will be rendered upon this
separate use of water. The special water meter must be installed pursuant to
the specifications of the Department of Service.
(Ord. 9-87. passed 3-9-87.)
1036.11 UNLAWFUL DEPOSITS AND DISCHARGES; USE OF PUBLIC SEWERS REQUIRED.

(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1038.04 SEWER TAPPER'S LICENSE; BOND.
   (a)   All plumbers and contractors shall have a valid sewer tapper's
license, issued by the Department of Service, before beginning any construction
of any water or sewer service connection in the Municipality or its water or
sewer districts, as provided in Ohio R.C. 715.27.
   (b)   Before a sewer tapper's license will be issued, the plumber or
contractor shall post with the Department a surety bond or certified check in
the amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000), which may be used to reimburse
the Department in the event of damage or loss to the Municipality during
construction or installation. Bonds will be valid from the date of issue until
January 31 of the following year and will be returned by February 15 of the
year following their issue.
   Homeowners making their own installations must submit a five thousand dollar
($5,000) surety bond before a connection permit can be issued.
   (c)   Applications for sewer tappers' licenses are available at the office
of the Department during normal business hours. Each license shall be valid
from the date of issue until January 15 of the following year. Processing time
shall be two work days following application.
   (d)   No plumber or contractor shall perform water or sewer connections
without first posting a surety bond and obtaining a sewer tapper's license.
   (e)   The posting of such bond and the holding of such license does not hold
the plumber or contractor harmless for damage or loss incurred by the private
property owner. The surety bond posted as a requirement for a sewer tapper's
license may be used to reimburse losses to the public portion of the water or
sewer system or appurtenances thereof. The issuing of such license is not an
endorsement nor recommendation of any plumber or contractor on the part of the
Municipality.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87; Ord. 11-98. Passed 4-28-98.)
1038.05 CONNECTION PROCEDURES.
   (a)   No sanitary sewer connection will be made to a single family unit or
commercial building until the rough interior plumbing has been completed,
inspected and approved and all sources of ground or subsurface water from the
area of the structure have been drained to an acceptable discharge point.
   (b)   No water taps will be permitted until the connection into the sanitary
sewer has been made. If sanitary sewer service is not available to the
property, no water tap will be permitted until a septic tank permit is obtained
from the Warren County or Montgomery County Health Department, whichever is
applicable.
   (c)   All construction shall be performed in accordance with the
requirements and specifications of the Water Division and the Sewer Division
set forth in this chapter, and all work shall be inspected and approved by an
authorized inspector of the Department of Service.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1038.06 CONSTRUCTION OF CONNECTIONS.
   (a)   General Rules. 
      (1)   All work shall be inspected and approved by an authorized inspector
of the Department of Service. Any work covered prior to the inspection shall be
uncovered by the contractor, and an opportunity shall be provided to inspect
the inside as well as the outside of the pipe.
      (2)   Prior to receiving a permit for any work requiring excavation in a
street, highway or road right-of-way, the person desiring to make such
excavation shall obtain from the proper authority the required permit for each
such excavation and shall agree to comply with all the requirements of the
issuing authority. This permit shall be shown to the inspector at the
commencement of construction and shall be kept "on the job" at all times while
work is in progress.
      (3)   All excavations for building sewer and water service lateral
installations shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights to protect
the public from hazard. (Also refer to OSHA 2226.) Streets, sidewalks, parkways
and other public property disturbed in the course of work shall be restored in
a manner satisfactory to the Sanitary Engineer.
      (4)   The Sanitary Engineer or his or her authorized agent shall approve

lateral or building sewer to be replaced and reinstalled.
      (5)   If any contractor or other individual neglects or refuses to comply
with any of the requirements of these Water and Sewer Regulations within a
reasonable time after receiving written notice from the Sanitary Engineer to do
so, the Sanitary Engineer may cause such work to be performed and the cost
thereof to be charged to the contractor or other individual. The contractor's
or other individual's diligence in making restoration of damage to property or
settled backfill or in reseeding for which he or she is responsible, will be
taken into consideration in the issuance of future permits to that contractor
or individual.
   (b)   Building Sewers. 
      (1)   The building sewer for a single family residential structure shall
be not less than four inches in internal diameter, with a minimum slope of one

         (Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1038.07 POWERS AND AUTHORITY OF INSPECTORS.
   (a)   The Sanitary Engineer, or other duly authorized representative of the
Municipality bearing proper credentials and identification, shall be permitted
to enter all properties for the purpose of inspection, observation,
measurement, sampling and testing in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter. The Sanitary Engineer or his or her representative shall have no
authority to inquire into any process beyond that point which has a direct
bearing on the kind and source of discharge to the sewers and waterways of
facilities for waste treatment.
   (b)   The Sanitary Engineer and other duly authorized representatives of the
Municipality bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted
to enter all private properties through which the Municipality holds a duly
negotiated easement for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection,
observation, measurement, sampling, repair and maintenance of any portion of
the sewage works lying within such easement. All entry and subsequent work, if
any, on such easement shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the
duly negotiated easement pertaining to the private property involved. (Ord. 9-
87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1038.08 INSPECTIONS.
   (a)   The construction of all building sewers and water service laterals
shall be inspected and approved by an authorized inspector of the Department of
Service. Any work covered prior to the inspection shall be uncovered by the
contractor, and an opportunity shall be provided to inspect the inside as well
as the outside of the pipe.
   (b)   All materials and workmanship shall be in strict accordance with the
specifications of the Department. Inferior or defective materials may be
ordered removed from a job, and improper and substandard workmanship shall be
ordered to be reinstalled.
   (c)   A minimum of forty eight hours notice shall be given prior to the
initiation of any construction in order to permit the scheduling of an
inspector. The contractor shall ensure the delivery of such notice. Such notice
shall state the permit number, location of the work to be performed and the
anticipated construction time required for the inspection requested. The
contractor shall immediately inform the Department of any unforeseen delays or
postponements prior to 9:00 a.m. of the day for which an inspection is
scheduled.
   (d)   If it is necessary for another inspection to be made to complete the
approval of either the water service lateral or the building sewer, an
additional inspection fee shall be levied. Also, inspections scheduled for
weekends or holidays shall result in additional fees to be determined by the
Sanitary Engineer. (See Section
1040.08 et seq.)
   (e)   The presence of the Sanitary Engineer or his or her authorized
inspector does not relieve a contractor or other individual of his or her duty
to protect any structure either above, below or at the surface of the ground.
If any damage arises due to negligence of the contractor or other individual,
it shall be his or her bonded duty to correct such damage within a period of
ninety six hours. Upon the builder's failure to do so, the Sanitary Engineer
may cause such damage to be repaired and the damaged property to be replaced
either by contract, without advertising, or by such other arrangement as may be
most convenient and satisfactory. The bill for the entire cost of the same
shall be rendered to the contractor who shall be liable therefor and shall pay
the same at once. (Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1038.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this
chapter is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) for each offense. A separate offense shall be deemed
committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance occurs or
continues.
   (b)   In addition to the penalty provided in subsection (a) hereof, whoever
violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
subject to revocation or suspension of permits and/or licenses granted
hereunder and, further, shall be liable and responsible for any and all damage
incurred as a result of such violation.

1040.01 WATER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (a)   Water service charges shall be billed for any building, enterprise or
residence to which water service is provided, either directly or indirectly.
   (b)   Water rates shall be in accordance with the rates established by
Council for the areas serviced.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1040.02 SEWER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (a)   Sanitary sewer service charges will be billed for any building,
enterprise or residence to which sewer service is available and which is
discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either
directly or indirectly, into the sanitary sewerage system.
   (b)   The sewer rates shall be in accordance with the rates established by
Council for the area served. Any building not connected to the sanitary sewer
within the specified length of time after the availability of the sanitary
sewer shall receive a monthly minimum bill. This shall apply only in areas
where revenue bonds are issued for the construction of sanitary sewers. Sewer
service charges and associated billing charges are provided for in Chapter
206.
   (c)   The sewer service charge shall be based upon the metered rate of water
usage or upon the minimum monthly rate, whichever is greater. However, to allow
for water consumption which is not ultimately discharged into the sanitary
sewerage system, a maximum sewer service charge shall be established for single
family residential consumers only on an individual basis for the summer months.
The maximum charge shall be 125 percent of the average water consumption for
the four billing periods from November through June. Each consumer's maximum
charge may differ and shall be adjusted annually. For new service established
during or after the winter base period, for which only one or two meter
readings have been obtained, an average maximum charge for the area will be
calculated and applied for the initial summer period.
   (d)   Sewer service charges for consumers not served by a metered water
supply shall be established on a case by case basis at a flat rate which will
correspond to the average quantity of wastewater discharged into the sewerage
system by comparable consumers of the area with metered water service. This
charge shall include sufficient amounts necessary for, but not limited to, debt
retirement on the system, maintenance, operation of the system and payment of
those items necessary for the proper functioning of the system. (Ord. 9-87.
Passed 3-9-87.)
1040.03 OWNER'S RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)   Owners of property shall be held responsible for water used and
wastewater discharged from their premises. The owner shall be responsible for
payment. No separate agreement between an owner of property and any other agent
or designate shall be construed to mitigate the owner's responsibility for the
payment. Account delinquency shall be just cause for terminating services which
will be resumed only upon full payment of delinquent charges. Responsibility
for payment of delinquent charges to the property rests with the current
property owner.
   (b)   It is the responsibility of the prospective property owner to inquire
as to possible delinquent charges which may be assumed upon ownership. This
information will be given upon request to the Department of Service.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1040.04 BILLING PERIODS.
   (a)   Meter readings will be taken monthly and as near the same date of the
month as is practical.
   (b)   If the Municipality is unable to render monthly bills because of a
labor shortage or some other deficiency, the bills may be rendered for a
shorter or longer period, but at the same monthly rate.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1040.05 BILLING AND PAYMENT.
   (a)   Bills will be mailed or otherwise delivered by the Department of
Service monthly to the address of the water and/or sewer consumer as on file
with the Department. Failure to receive bills for water and/or sewer service
will not relieve the consumer from responsibility for prompt payment.
   (b)   Billing dates will be approximately twelve working days after meters
are read. The due date as stamped on the bill will be approximately twenty
working days from the date of billing and will be the last date for payment
without incurring a penalty.
   (c)   Bills shall be paid at the office of the Department or at any
authorized collection agency for the Municipality. The date on which payment is
delivered to the office of the Department will determine the time payment is
considered to be received.
   (d)   Where bills for water and/or sewer service are not paid on or before
the due date stated on the bill, a penalty of ten percent of the amount due
shall be added to the net amount due, plus a penalty for any late payment.
   (e)   Bills remaining unpaid following the due date stated on the bill shall
be declared delinquent. The consumer will be immediately notified of such
delinquency and unless the bill is paid within thirty working days of the due
date stated on the original bill, a twenty four hour shut off notice may be
hand delivered to the property, and service may be terminated the following
day. (See Sections
1040.15 and
1040.16.)
    (f)   Water service will be turned on only after payment in full of all
delinquent charges, including penalties and turn on charges.
   (g)   If the bill is not paid within sixty days of the due date stated on
the bill, the delinquent bill, together with the accumulated penalty, may be
certified over to the applicable County Auditor for collection at the same time
as other taxes and assessments are collected.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1040.06 ADJUSTMENTS OF BILLS.
   (a)   Bills will be corrected if the consumer requests a meter test and it
is determined, upon testing, that the meter readings obtained are in error. The
charges for this service are provided for in Chapter
206. A request for testing shall not be deemed a satisfactory reason for
nonpayment of a bill by the due date.
   (b)   Estimated bills will be corrected if the consumer makes a request for
correction by the due date stamped on the bill and presents evidence
satisfactory to the Department of Service that conditions during the period
covered by the estimated bill differ from conditions prevailing during the
period used as a basis for the bill.
   (c)   No reduction in sewer and water service charges shall be made for
leakage from the water service lateral, except in cases where it appears upon
investigation that the leakage is underground and not subject to detection by
ordinary methods, and where the owner and other occupants of the premises are
free from negligence in causing or failing to report the leakage. Where the
owner has made diligent efforts to provide such repairs and has actually
employed a plumber to make them, a reasonable period of time may be granted to
permit the repairs to be made. Any and all adjustments of bills shall be at the
discretion of the Sanitary Engineer, and his or her decision in all such
matters shall be final. If a premises is found to be utilizing water from the
Municipal water system or discharging sewage or other wastes into the Municipal
sewer system without payment of the monthly service charges, the Department
shall measure or establish the quantity of such water or wastes for the purpose
of establishing a proper charge in accordance with Section
1040.08 and such premises shall be charged for the total term of the prior
usage on the basis of the quantity so determined.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1040.07 DEPOSITS REQUIRED.
   (a)   An applicant for water or sewer service, or both, who is not the owner
of the property for which service is requested shall deposit with the
Department of Service a fee as determined by the Municipality. Such charges are
provided for in Chapter
206. Such deposit shall be used to pay delinquent or past due accounts of the
applicant making the deposit. All deposits shall be kept in a separate fund
designated "Service Deposits." The full amount of the deposit, less any charges
due for water and/or sewer service, shall be refunded when service is
terminated.
   (b)   In addition to the deposit required in subsection (a) hereof,
applicants must submit a form, which is available at the Department, signed by
the owner of the property authorizing the Municipality to initiate or to
reinstate water and/or sewer service.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1040.08 SCHEDULE OF CHARGES.
   The Manager shall conduct an annual review of user charges to ensure that,
in the future, sufficient revenue is generated to provide adequate treatment on
a continuing basis and that each recipient of service pays its proportionate
share of operation, maintenance and repair costs. This review will be conducted
through a comparison of charges assessed the Municipality by the Miami
Conservancy District and charges assessed various user classes by the
Municipality.
    Each user will receive annual notification, in conjunction with a regular
billing, of the rate and that portion of the user charge which is attributable
to OM and R costs of wastewater treatment services. Users are presently billed
monthly on an estimated flow at a flat monthly charge. If the user fails to pay
the bill by the due date, a ten percent penalty shall be assessed. If the bill
still remains unpaid, the amount shall be certified over to the County
Auditor's office to be placed against the property taxes. The Municipality also
reserves the right to disconnect service physically.
   Fees and charges for water and sewer service shall be as provided in the
General Fee Schedule.
1040.09 WATER RATES.
   A uniform water usage rate as provided in the General Fee Schedule shall be
charged to residents and to nonresidents of the Municipality, respectively.
(Ord. 21-97. Passed 10-28-97; Ord. 11-98. Passed 4-28-98.)
1040.10 SEWER RATES.
   (a)   Determined by Water Usage. Sewer rates determined by water usage will
be 150 percent of the charge made by US Filter/EOS to the Municipality for flow
through the system.
   (b)   Flat Rate Without Water Usage. For each single family residence (one
equivalent residential unit (ERU)) served by the sanitary sewer system to which
a Municipal water supply is not available or is not being utilized, there shall
be a flat monthly charge as provided in the General Fee Schedule.
(Ord. 25-97. Passed 12-10-97; Ord. 11-98. Passed 4-28-98.)
   (c)   Maximum Charge. The sewer service charge shall be based upon the
metered rate of water usage or the minimum bimonthly rate, whichever is
greater. However, to allow for water consumption which is not ultimately
discharged into the sanitary sewerage system, a maximum sewer service charge
shall be established for single family residential consumers only on an
individual basis for the summer months. The maximum charge shall be 125 percent
of the average winter consumption for the four billing periods November through
June. Each consumer's maximum charge may differ and shall be adjusted annually.
For new services established during or after the winter base period for which
only one or two meter readings have been obtained, an average maximum charge
for the area will be calculated and applied for the initial summer period.
   (d)   Excessive Pollutants. Any waste containing BOD, suspended solids or
any other pollutants that are in excess of normal domestic sewage (i.e. 200 mg/
l BOD or 250 mg/l SS) that is discharged into the sewerage system shall be
subject to a surcharge as determined by the Sanitary Engineer.
    (e)   Right to Increase Charges. The charges provided for in this section
are minimum, not maximum, charges and the Municipality serves the right and is
obligated to increase the same at any time if the revenues of the sewerage
system are insufficient to pay the operation and maintenance expenses and the
debt service and reserve charges of revenue bonds issued to construct or to
improve the sewerage system.
   (f)   Revenue Bonds. The rate structure provided for in this section is an
integral part of the financing of the sewerage system construction and
improvements inasmuch as the establishment thereof is necessary to provide
sufficient coverage for principal and interest charges on issues of revenue
bonds and for other requirements created by resolutions authorizing such issues
of bonds. The maintenance of the sewerage rate structure shall be for the
benefit of the purchasers and holders of such issues of bonds and shall
constitute a contract with them by the terms of the rate resolutions and these
Water and Sewer Regulations.

1040.11 TERMINATION OF SERVICE.
   (a)   By request to the Department of Service, any consumer may have water
service temporarily or permanently discontinued. The water meter will be
removed or the service will be shut off and a final reading will be obtained.
If it is not possible to obtain a final reading, a closing statement will be
prepared by the billing office on the basis of previous usage, prorated for the
time elapsed since the last reading. Under no circumstances shall the closing
statement be less than the minimum charge prorated for the usage period. When
service is re established, a turn on charge will be levied as provided for in
Section
1040.08 et seq.
   (b)   If a problem occurs on the property owner's side of the meter, water
service may be temporarily discontinued until the necessary repairs have been
completed. In such cases, the meter valve will be shut off by personnel of the
Department at the request of the consumer. The charges for such service are
provided for in Section
1040.08 et seq.
   (c)   The water service will be turned off and discontinued for nonpayment
of water or sewer service charges. Water service will be re established only
after payment in full of all delinquent charges for water and sewer service,
including penalties and turn on charges. Any violation of the provisions of
these Water and Sewer Regulations shall be cause for having water service
discontinued. Water service will be reinstated only after the correction of the
violation and the payment in full of all charges and penalties.
   (d)   If it is necessary to turn off the water service at the corporation
stop, the turn on charge shall cover all expenses incurred and shall be in
addition to the fee provided for in Chapter
206. (Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)

tap in charge shall be paid. In addition, a nonparticipant charge (public
construction or private construction) may be applicable.
      (2)   The lots and parcels of land specifically covered by the
nonparticipant charges described in this chapter are set forth and delineated
on special maps in the offices of the Manager, to which reference is hereby
made for identification purposes. (Adopting Ordinance)
   (b)   Tap In Charges. 
      (1)   Tap in charges shall apply to all connections of improved
properties, whether residential, commercial, industrial or manufacturing, to
the water supply system.
      (2)   All tap in charges shall be paid in cash and in full prior to
installation of water service laterals, unless amortized over a two year period
at an annual interest rate of ten percent.
         (Res. 7-95. Passed 2-28-95; Ord. 11-98. Passed 4-28-98.)
      (3)   The proceeds of the tap in charges shall be applied in the
following order of priority:
         A.   To make any necessary capital improvements of the water supply
system including the enlargement, replacement, improvement or extension of the
water supply system; and
         B.   To the conduct, management and operation of the water supply
system; and
         C.   To the payment of interest or principal of any loan indebtedness
or liability incurred in connection therewith.
            (Ord. 8-14. Passed 9-9-14.)
      (4)   A uniform tap in charge based upon meter size of the water service
lateral serving the property, as set forth in the General Fee Schedule, shall
be charged for connections made.
      (5)   Any property owner within the Municipal corporation limits who
signs a contract, prior to January 1, 1997, guaranteeing his or her intent to
begin using Municipal water upon availability will receive a five hundred
dollar ($500.00) rebate on his or her tap in fees.
         (Res. 7-95. Passed 2-28-95; Ord. 11-98. Passed 4-28-98.)
   (c)   Equalization Charges.  
      (1)   When connecting to a water supply system, owners of improved
property, whether residential, commercial, industrial or manufacturing, unless
otherwise indicated, may have to pay an equalization charge in addition to the
tap in charge. If such properties were undeveloped at the time the calculations
of assessments were made and the original improvement constructed, the owners
must pay a fee which represents an equalization charge to the special
assessments or unit charges levied against benefited properties at the time of
construction of the existing water supply system, as set forth in the
proceedings undertaken by Council.
      (2)   All equalization charges shall be paid in cash and in full prior to
connection to the water supply system.
      (3)   Equalization charges shall be deposited in the special assessment
Bond Retirement Fund for the water supply system construction and improvements
until such time as the outstanding obligations issued therefor have been paid
in full. Thereafter, the equalization charges shall be deposited in the
Waterworks System Revenue Fund.
   (d)   Nonparticipant Charges for Private Construction.
      (1)   Nonparticipant charges shall apply to all connections of improved
properties, whether residential, commercial, industrial or manufacturing, to an
extension of the water supply system constructed pursuant to a private contract
providing for reimbursement of original costs, when such properties were
nonparticipants in the original cost. (See Section
1032.11.)
      (2)   Prior to the installation of the water service lateral, the
nonparticipant charge shall be paid in full.
      (3)   The proceeds of the nonparticipant charges shall be held in a
separate and distinct fund designated as the "Reimbursement Fund for the
Carlisle Water Improvement," to be paid quarterly to the individual,
organization or agency of private enterprise that constructed the extension.
   (e)   System Capacity Charges. 
      (1)   System capacity charges shall apply to all connections of improved
property to a water system in a sewer district or part thereof, for which
transmission and treatment services are provided by another political
subdivision under written contract or agreement with the Municipality which
requires these charges prior to connection to the water supply system.
      (2)   Prior to the installation of the water service lateral, a system
capacity charge and an appropriate tap in charge shall be paid in full.
         (Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1040.13 CONNECTIONS TO SEWERAGE SYSTEM.
   (a)   Generally.  
      (1)   When connections are made to the sanitary sewerage system of the
Municipality, a connection charge for the privilege of such connections shall
be paid. In addition, a nonparticipant charge and/or a system capacity charge
may be applicable, either singly or in combination.
      (2)   The lots and parcels of land specifically covered by the
nonparticipant charges and/or system capacity charges described herein are set
forth and delineated on a special map in the office of the Manager, to which
reference is hereby made for identification purposes.
         (Adopting Ordinance)
   (b)   Connection Charges; Payment; Proceeds.
      (1)   Connection charges shall apply to all connections of improved
properties, whether residential, commercial, industrial or manufacturing, to
the sanitary sewerage system of the Municipality.
      (2)   Prior to installation of building sewers in the respective sewer
districts, all connection charges shall be paid in full or if requested by the
property owner and determined to be equitable by Council, provision for payment
thereof in installments shall be made pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 729.
      (3)   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Paragraph (b)(3) was repealed by implication by
Ordinance 27 92, passed September 8, 1992. See Section
1040.175.)
   (c)   Construction Tap In Fees. The construction tap in fee shall be based
on and shall be used to pay the local share of the costs of constructing system
improvements and shall apply to all properties, whether residential,
commercial, industrial or manufacturing where sewers are available.
   (d)   Capacity Charge. The entire sewer project system has been designed and
constructed to account for existing and future connections. The connection
design criteria were developed by the Miami Conservancy District as an
"equivalent unit," being 280 gpd.
   The capacity charge shall be used to reserve capacity and shall apply to all
properties, whether residential, commercial, industrial or manufacturing, or to
vacant lots or parcels where sewers are available.
   (e)   Sewer Equalization Charges for Nonparticipant Areas. There is hereby
established a sewer equalization charge to be paid by the applicant at the time
of his or her application to tap into the sewerage system, when the sewerage
system has been installed and paid for by the developer. Of this charge, three
hundred dollars ($300.00) shall be paid to the Miami Conservancy District and
the remainder shall be paid into the Sewer fund of the Municipality.
      (1)   When connecting to a sewerage system, owners of improved property,
whether residential, commercial, industrial or manufacturing, unless otherwise
indicated, shall have to pay a sewer equalization charge (nonparticipant) in
addition to the applicable connection permit charge and, if applicable, a
street cut permit.
      (2)   All sewer equalization charges shall be paid in full before any
connection permit is issued.
   (f)   User Charge and Construction Charges. 
      (1)   The following rates and charges of rents, which are hereby
determined to be just and equitable, are hereby established. Such charges shall
be paid to the Municipality, for the use of sanitary sewerage services, by
every person whose premises are served by a connection thereto, as provided by
Ohio R.C. 729.49. Such charges shall consist of the aggregate of the following
two components, payable monthly, such charges to commence as of March 1, 1985,
to be due and billed May 1, 1985:
         User charge    (See Section
1040.10(b).)
         Construction charge   $27.59
However, for any property for which a person pays all of the sum calculated to
be due and payable as the charge for the type of connection required for such
property, the construction charge shall be deemed to be fully paid and such
property shall be exempt from the construction charge. Further, for any
property for which a person pays part of the sum calculated to be due and
payable as the charge for the type of connection required for such property,
the principal amount due on the construction charge shall be reduced to the
extent of the payment. Such total or partial exemption from the construction
charge shall apply only to the property for which payment was made, and such
exemption shall be said to run with the land and shall apply to subsequent
owners thereof. As evidence of such exemption, the Municipality shall issue to
any person who pays the proper amount for an exemption a certificate of
exemption from the construction charge of the sanitary sewer rate, signed by
the Mayor and the Director of Finance, notarized and describing the property to
which the partial or total exemption applies and the amount of such exemption.
Such certificate may be recorded, at the cost of the person receiving it, at
the office of the County Recorder, and such certificate or a recorded copy
thereof must be presented to the appropriate official of the Municipality by
any person claiming an exemption from the construction charge.
         (Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
      (2)   The user charge shall at all times generate revenues equal to 110
percent over the actual yearly requirements for operating and maintenance
expenses of the system. If at any time such revenues drop below such ratio, an
adjustment in the user charge shall automatically be made in such an amount as
to restore the 110 percent coverage, provided that Council shall have the right
to veto such rate adjustment within sixty days of its effective date, after
first holding a public meeting on the question of the rate adjustment. Notice
of such meeting shall be published at least once in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Municipality not less than seven days prior to such meeting.
Any excess funds collected shall be set aside and used for operation,
maintenance and repair of the system.
         (Ord. 25-97. Passed 12-10-97.)
      (3)   For purposes of this section:
         A.   The user charge shall be based on and shall be used to pay the
actual operation and maintenance costs of the sanitary sewerage system of the
Municipality.
         B.   The construction charge shall be based on and shall be used to
pay the local share of the costs of constructing system improvements.
   (g)   Delinquency Surcharge. The user charge and/or construction charge
shall be due and payable on the date of rendition thereof. If such charges are
not paid by the tenth of the following month, a ten percent surcharge shall be
added to the amount of the charges.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1040.14 COLLECTION OF RATES AND CHARGES.
   The rates and charges established in this chapter will be collected from
owners, occupants and users of premises within the Municipality from and after
the effective date of this section (Ordinance 9 87, passed March 9, 1987). If
such rates and charges are not paid when due, they shall be collected in the
same manner as are other Municipal corporation taxes.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1040.15 NONPAYMENT; REMEDY OF MUNICIPALITY.
   If charges for sewerage service are not paid within thirty days after the
rendition of the bill for such service, such charges shall be deemed and are
hereby declared to be delinquent. Thereafter such delinquency shall constitute
a lien upon the real estate for which such service is supplied. The Director of
Finance is hereby authorized and directed to file sworn statements showing such
delinquencies in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds, and the filing of
such statements shall be deemed notice of the lien of such charges for service.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1040.16 DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE.
   All sewerage service shall be discontinued without further notice if charges
for such service are not paid within thirty days after the rendition of the
bill therefor. The Director of Finance is hereby authorized and directed to
take whatever steps are necessary to discontinue such service, including, but
not limited to, engaging the services of a back hoe operator, plumbing or sewer
contractor or other personnel needed to discontinue such service. All charges
and costs incurred by reason of such discontinuance of service shall constitute
a lien on the property in the same manner as do delinquent charges for such
service.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1040.17 SEWER FUND.
   There is hereby established, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 729.52, a separate fund
to be known as the Sewer Fund of the Municipality. Regular collections for
sewerage service shall be deposited in such Fund, to be used to defray the cost
of such service to the users thereof.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1040.175 DEPOSIT OF SEWER TAP IN CHARGES IN THE CAPITAL ASSET, CAPITAL
IMPROVEMENT AND LAND PURCHASE FUND.
   (a)   All future receipts of sewer tap in charges shall be deposited in the
Capital Asset, Capital Improvement and Land Purchase (CACIL) Fund.
   (b)   The CACIL Fund will be used in a manner consistent with its intended
purpose for improvement of the infrastructure of the Municipality and the
purchase of lands and other capital assets.
(Ord. 27-92. Passed 9-8-92.)
1040.177 SEWER CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FUND.
   There is hereby established a fund to be known as the Sewer Capital
Improvement Fund. All applicable revenues received shall be paid into such
separate Fund from the Capital Asset, Capital Improvement Fund and Land
Purchase (CACIL) Fund. (Ord. 1-98. Passed 2-10-98.)
1040.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this
chapter is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) for each offense. A separate offense shall be deemed
committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance occurs or
continues.
   (b)   In addition to the penalty provided in subsection (a) hereof, whoever
violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
subject to revocation or suspension of permits and/or licenses granted
hereunder and, further, shall be liable and responsible for any and all damage
incurred as a result of such violation.

   Separate preliminary plans for each utility shall be submitted in accordance
with the following:
   (a)   Each preliminary plan shall show the lot layout and overall water
supply and/or sanitary sewerage systems, including connections to existing
facilities.
   (b)   The size of preliminary plans shall be in multiples of six inches and
shall not exceed thirty six inches by forty eight inches.
   (c)   The scale for preliminary plans shall be either one inch equals 100
feet or one inch equals 200 feet.
   (d)   Preliminary plans shall show existing contours with intervals of five
feet where the slope is greater than ten percent, two feet where the slope is
less than ten percent and one foot where the slope is flat.
   (e)   Preliminary plans shall be revised to "as built" condition with the
completion of each section and shall be resubmitted with a request for approval

1042.05 CONSTRUCTION.
   (a)   Design, materials and workmanship shall conform in all respects to the
"Specifications of the Department of Service," which shall be considered as
minimum specifications. Whenever these provisions are different from
requirements of other lawfully adopted regulations, the more restrictive rule
or higher standard shall prevail. If the proposed improvements are to be
constructed by contract, the contract shall contain this stipulation.
   (b)   All construction shall be performed in the presence of an inspector
authorized by the Sanitary Engineer. The cost for all such inspection shall be
borne solely by the owner.
    (c)   At least seven days prior to the proposed starting date, the owner or
his or her contractor shall submit a request, in writing, for permission to
start construction. If all the necessary procedures have been followed and the
necessary inspection has been scheduled, a reply will be issued by the
Department authorizing the initiation of construction.
   (d)   If the Sanitary Engineer has written proof or evidence that any such
work is being improperly performed, he or she may order all work stopped. The
owner or his or her contractor shall thereupon cease construction and shall not
resume it until authorized, in writing, by the Sanitary Engineer to do so.
   (e)   Before receiving a permit for any work requiring excavation in any
street, highway or road right-of-way, the person desiring to make such
excavation shall obtain from the proper authority the required permit for such
work and shall agree to comply with all requirements of the authority issuing
such permit. If no street cut permit is required by the authority having
jurisdiction over a particular street or highway, a written statement to that
effect must be obtained from such authority.
   (f)   No provision of these Water and Sewer Regulations shall be so
construed as to relieve the owner of the responsibility to furnish all private
engineering, surveying and inspection services that are necessary in connection
with improvements.
   (g)   Council hereby expressly disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy
or completeness of any information given by any employee of the Municipality in
regard to existing structures.

   (c)   If the Department determines that any work is improper, it may order
all work stopped. Work shall not proceed until the owner has received written
permission from the Department to do so.
   (d)   All expenses associated with inspection and testing of proposed water
and/or sanitary sewerage improvements shall be borne by the owner. Monthly
invoices for expenses incurred by the Department for such inspection and
testing shall be rendered and shall be payable within thirty days of the date
of such invoices.
(Ord. 9-87. Passed 3-9-87.)
1042.07 MAINTENANCE BONDS.
    All public water and sanitary sewerage improvements shall be guaranteed by
the owner for a period of one year from the date such improvements are accepted
by the Municipality. Such guarantee shall include any and all defects and
deficiencies in workmanship and material. The cost for all labor, materials,
tools, equipment and other incidentals that are required to maintain, repair
and replace any and all such improvements and to maintain the same in good and
proper condition, excluding ordinary wear and tear, but including filling
trenches and restoring lawns, sidewalks, yards, streets, sewers, water mains,
etc., during the one year guarantee period, shall be assumed by the owner. If
the owner fails to perform such maintenance or to make such repair or
replacement within a reasonable time after receiving notice to do so, in
writing, from the Municipality, or in the event of an emergency which may
endanger life or property, the Municipality may make, or cause to be made, such
repair or replacement at the expense of the owner. In order to indemnify the
Municipality for the expenses of any such repair or replacement made by or at
the direction of the Municipality, a maintenance bond shall be posted by the
owner. Such bond shall be in the amount of at least ten percent of the cost of
such public improvements. At the end of the one year period and at the written
request of the applicant, the Municipality will make a final inspection of the
water supply or sewerage facilities and, if such improvements meet all
applicable standards and requirements of the Department of Service, the
maintenance bond will be released and the improvements will be accepted for
maintenance and operation by the Municipality.

discharge to apply for and obtain a waste discharge permit authorizing and
limiting the discharge for specific pollutants.
   (b)   Where pretreatment or flow equalization prior to discharge into the
POTW is required, plans, specifications and other pertinent data or information
relating to such pretreatment or flow control facilities shall first be
submitted to the Municipality for review and approval. Such approval shall not
exempt the discharger from compliance with any other applicable code,
ordinance, rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority. Any
subsequent alterations or additions to such pretreatment or flow control
facilities shall not be made without due notice to and prior approval of the
Municipality.
   (c)   If pretreatment or control of waste flows is required, such facilities
shall be maintained in good working order and operated as efficiently as
possible by the owner or operator at his or her own cost and expense, subject
to the requirements of these rules and regulations and all other applicable
codes, ordinances and laws.
   (d)   Whenever it is necessary an authorized representative of the
Municipality, upon presentation of identification, may enter upon any property
or premises at reasonable times for the purpose of copying any records required
to be kept under the provisions of this chapter, inspecting any processes or
equipment where wastewater is generated and discharged to the POTW and sampling
any discharge of wastewater to the POTW.

1043.05 INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER MONITORING AND REPORTING.
   (a)   Discharge Reports.
      (1)   Baseline Monitoring Report; ninety day compliance report. Within
180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard,
existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards
and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall be
required to submit to the Municipality a Baseline Monitoring Report (BMR), on a
form provided by the Municipality, indicating the nature and concentration of
all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by
pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flow
for these process units in the user's facility which are limited by such
pretreatment standards or requirements.
A completed wastewater discharge permit application form may fulfill the
requirement for a BMR if all conditions and time frames are met.
New sources and sources that become industrial users after promulgation of an
applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the
Municipality the BMR at least ninety days prior to commencement of discharge.
The BMR shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user.
Within ninety days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or, in the case of a new source, following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial
user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
Municipality a report, on a form provided by the Municipality, indicating the
nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated
process which are limited by pretreatment standards and requirements.
The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what is necessary
to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements.
The ninety day compliance report shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the industrial user.
      (2)   Periodic compliance reports. Any user subject to a pretreatment
standard or requirement shall periodically submit to the Municipality a report
indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are
limited by pretreatment standards or requirements. Such reports shall be
submitted according to the frequency prescribed in the user's wastewater
discharge permit. Periodic compliance reports shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the industrial user.
      (3)   Certification. All reports and applications required to be filed
under this section shall be signed by an authorized representative of the
industrial user under the following certification statement:
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations.
      (4)   Signatures on reports. The reports required by this section shall
be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user, as follows:
         A.   A responsible corporate officer if the industrial user submitting
the reports is a corporation. A responsible corporate officer means a
president, secretary, treasurer or vice president of the corporation in charge
of a principal business function, or any other person who performs similar
policy or decision making functions for the corporation, or the manager of one
or more manufacturing, production or operation facilities if authority to sign
documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in accordance with
corporate procedures;
          B.   By a general partner or proprietor if the industrial user
submitting the reports is a partnership or sole proprietorship; or
         C.   By a duly authorized representative of the individuals described
in paragraphs (4)A. and B. hereof.
      (5)   Basis of reports. The reports required by this section shall be
based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed
during the period covered by the report, which data is representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period.
      (6)   Contents of periodic discharge monitoring report. If an industrial
user monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the Municipality,
the results of this monitoring shall be included in the periodic discharge
monitoring report.
      (7)   Sampling and analysis procedures. All sampling and analyses shall
be performed in accordance with procedures contained in 40 CFR Part 136 and
amendments thereto.
   (b)   Record Maintenance and Wastewater Monitoring Facilities.
      (1)   All industrial users shall retain and preserve, for no less than
three years, any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence,
and any and all summaries thereof, relating to monitoring, sampling and
chemical analyses made by or on behalf of an industrial user in connection with
its discharge. All records which pertain to materials which are subject to
administrative adjustment or any other enforcement or litigation activities
brought by the Municipality pursuant hereto shall be retained and preserved by
the discharger until all enforcement activities have concluded and all periods
of limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired.
      (2)   Such records shall be made available upon request by the
Municipality. A summary of such data indicating the industrial user's
compliance with this chapter shall be prepared quarterly by the Municipality
and submitted to the Subdistrict.

industrial wastes into the system may be required to install, at his or her own
cost and expense, suitable facilities to obtain accurate samples of wastewater
flow into the POTW. Such facilities shall be maintained in proper working order
and kept safe at all times.
      (4)   When more than one user can discharge into a common sewer, the
Municipality may require installation of separate monitoring facilities for
each user. When there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents
and characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the
Municipality may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for
each separate discharge.
      (5)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the Municipality's
requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications.

1068.01 USE OF FACILITIES BY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS; ADHERENCE TO POLICY
REQUIRED.
   The Municipality will make available certain facilities within Town Hall for
community based organizations. Those organizations that wish to make use of
these facilities shall adhere to the policies governing the usage of the
facilities provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 4-93. Passed 2-9-93.)
1068.02 AVAILABLE FACILITIES.
   Located in Town Hall are two rooms that are available for small group
meetings, i.e. groups of between five to forty persons.
(Ord. 4-93. Passed 2-9-93.)
1068.03 PURPOSE; PERMITTED GROUPS.
   The purpose of this policy is to open up the facilities to community based
groups that have no other place to meet. Those groups that are permitted to
make use of the facilities shall be non profit, non denominational, community
based groups located within the boundaries of the Municipality.
(Ord. 4-93. Passed 2-9-93.)
1068.04 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   To ensure the protection of governmental property and recognizing the fact
that any service offered to the public does have a cost, the following rules
and regulations shall govern the usage of Town Hall facilities by non profit,
community based groups:
   (a)   Groups wishing to reserve Council Chambers (and, when ready, the
multipurpose room) for use must come to the Manager's office two weeks prior to
the meeting date they seek. Availability shall be on a first come, first serve
basis: whoever reserves it first gets the room. Governmental functions take
priority over all other functions.
   (b)   At the time of reservation, the group must:
      (1)   Fill out a reservation request form, detailing the nature of the
group, the intended usage of the facility, the number of guests expected, the
name, address and phone number of the contact person for the group and the
number of hours the facility will be used.
      (2)   If the facility is to be used after 4:30 p.m., Monday through
Friday, or anytime during the weekend or on a governmental holiday, be assessed
a rental fee. If the group schedules the facility for a time that is during
regular business hours of Town Hall (8:00 a.m to 4:30 p.m.), there shall be no
rental fee. However, if the meeting goes beyond the regular working hours, the
group shall be charged for the time exceeding work hours by the half hour.
      (3)   Present a refundable cleaning and damage deposit. The group must
also fill out the damage responsibility form. The group shall be responsible
for any damage that exceeds the deposit. All damage must be reported.
      (4)   Fill out the liability waiver form and present proof of adequate
liability insurance to the Municipality.
   (c)   The Council Chambers is not a banquet facility. Therefore, groups
cannot hold breakfasts, luncheons or dinners therein. Snack variety foods shall
be permissible. Alcoholic beverages are not permissible.
   (d)   After completion of the meeting, the group is responsible for
returning the facility to the state it was prior to the meeting (i.e. furniture
must be placed as it was prior to the meeting) and cleaning the facility
completely. Failure to do so shall result in loss of the deposit.
   (e)   The contact person listed on the reservation form shall be responsible
for all guests (i.e. such guests' conduct, arrival, departure, etc.).
   (f)   If the majority of guests are under the age of eighteen, then for
every seven minors there shall be one adult.
   (g)   All meetings must conclude by 9:30 p.m.
   (h)   Users of the Town Hall facility shall abide by the general rules of
conduct established for employees of the Municipality and those rules and
regulations mandated by the State and the United States of America and their
agents, including, but not limited to, the following prohibitions:
      (1)   No smoking;
      (2)   No open flames;
      (3)   No obstruction of entrances and exits; and
      (4)   No behavior that places at risk persons or property.

1220.01 SHORT TITLE.
   This
Title Two of Part Twelve of these Codified Ordinances shall be known and may be
cited as the Subdivision Regulations of Carlisle, Ohio or just the Subdivision
Regulations. References in this
Title Two to "these Regulations" shall mean these Subdivision Regulations.
(Ord. 9-76. Passed 9-9-76.)
1220.02 PURPOSE; APPLICATION.
   (a)   The purpose of these Subdivision Regulations is to provide rules,
regulations and standards to guide the subdivision of land in order to promote
public health, safety, convenience and general welfare within the Municipality.
Standards shall be administered to ensure orderly growth and development, the
conservation, protection and proper use of land, and adequate provision for
traffic circulation, utilities and services.
   (b)   These Regulations shall not apply to any lot forming a part of a
subdivision created and recorded prior to the effective date of these
Regulations (Ordinance 9-76, passed September 9, 1976). It is not intended by
these Regulations to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way impair or interfere
with existing provisions of other laws or ordinances, except those specifically
repealed by these Regulations, with private restrictions placed upon property
by deed, covenant or other private agreement, or with restrictive covenants
running with the land to which the Municipality is a party.
      (c)   These Regulations shall apply to all unsubdivided land and to any
land replatted in the Municipality, but shall not be deemed a basis for, nor
shall they in any way diminish or relax, any existing restriction or provision
set forth in any subdivision protective covenant or in any such restrictive
covenant which may appear in any deed, contract or plat of record.
(Ord. 9-76. Passed 9-9-76.)
1220.03 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   (a)   No land shall, after the adoption of these Subdivision Regulations
(Ordinance 9-76, passed September 9, 1976), be subdivided or replatted without
complying with these Regulations.
   (b)   No lot, tract or parcel of land within any subdivision or constituting
a subdivision under Ohio R.C. Chapter 711 shall be offered for sale, nor shall
any sale or contract for sale which is intended to be recorded with the County
have any validity, until such subdivision, together with plans for improvements
thereto, have been properly reviewed and officially approved by the Planning
Commission and, where required, by Council.
   (c)   No permit required for any work in connection with any subdivision
shall be issued until the plat has been approved as prescribed in these
Regulations.
   (d)   No improvement, such as water supply, storm water drainage, sewerage
facilities, gas service, electric service or lighting, major grading operation,
or paving or surfacing of any street, shall be made within any subdivision by
any owner or his or her agent, or by any public service corporation at the
request of such owner or his or her agent, until the plat for the subdivision
and plans for improvements have been properly reviewed by the Municipal
Engineer and officially approved by the Commission and until the appropriate
bonds have been posted.
   (e)   Where a tract of land is proposed to be subdivided in several stages
over a period of years, and the subdivider requests approval in parts, he or
she shall, at the time of submission of the first part, submit a complete
preliminary plan of the entire tract to be eventually developed, with
appropriate sectioning adequate to demonstrate to the Commission that the total
design as proposed for the entire subdivision is acceptable under the terms of
these Regulations, including conformity with the Land Use Plan. The Commission
may give preliminary approval to the overall plan and final approval on the
parts as submitted from time to time.
   (f)   The Municipality hereby defines its policy to be that the Municipality
will withhold all public improvements, including the maintenance of streets and
the furnishing of sewerage facilities and water service, from all subdivisions
which have not been approved and from all areas dedicated to the public which
have not been accepted by the Commission and Council in the manner prescribed
in these Regulations.
   (g)   These Regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements
necessary in the subdivision of land.
(Ord. 9-76. Passed 9-9-76.)
1220.04 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in these Subdivision Regulations, unless the context clearly
indicates otherwise:
   (1)   "Alley" means a narrow service way providing a secondary public means
of access to abutting properties, which way is not more than twenty feet wide.
   (2)   "Block" means that property abutting on one side of a street between
the two nearest intersecting streets or other natural barriers.
   (3)   "Building line" means a line running parallel to and measured
perpendicularly from the lot line to the main building, defining the limits of
a yard in which no building or structure may be located above ground, except as
provided in these Regulations.
   (4)   "Certificate of occupancy" means a certificate issued by the Zoning
Inspector stating that the occupancy and use of a building, structure or land
referred to therein complies with these Regulations.
   (5)   "Crosswalk" means a strip of land dedicated to public use, which is
reserved across a block to provide pedestrian access to adjacent areas.
   (6)   "Cul-de-sac" (court of a dead-end street) means a short street having
one end open to traffic and the other end permanently terminated by a vehicular
turn-around.
   (7)   "Drainage right of way" means the land required for the installation
of a storm water sewer or drainage ditch, or the land required along a natural
stream or watercourse for preserving the channel and providing for the flow of
water therein to safeguard the public against flood damage.
   (8)   "Easement" means a grant by a property owner for the use of a strip of
land by the public or a person for a specified purpose.
   (9)   "Final plat" means the final map of all or a portion of the
subdivision which is presented to the Planning Commission and Council for final
approval in accordance with these Regulations, and which, if approved, shall be
filed with the proper County recording officer.
   (10)   "Hillside area" means any area with an average cross slope of sixteen
percent or greater.
   (11)   "Land Use Plan" means the Land Use Plan of the Municipality.
   (12)   "Lot" means a parcel of land defined by metes and bounds or boundary
lines in a recorded deed or on a recorded plat, fronting on a legally,
dedicated public thoroughfare. In determining lot area, no part thereof within
the limits of a proposed street right of way shall be included.
   (13)   "Performance bond agreement" means a bond in the amount of 110
percent of the Municipal Engineer's estimated cost of total required
improvements, to be posted as a bond for withdrawal only by Council to
guarantee the Municipality that the necessary public improvements will be
installed in the subdivision.
   (14)   "Preliminary plat" means a plat prepared by a professional registered
engineer or surveyor, incorporating recommendations and requirements of
planning authorities, and showing topography, means of drainage, roadways,
grades, sanitary sewer and waterline locations and easements on which the
Municipal Engineer encounters problems and shows means of solving them.
   (15)   "Street" means a right of way, other than an alley, dedicated,
undedicated or otherwise legally established to the public use, usually
affording the principal means of access to abutting property. A street may be
designated as a thoroughfare, parkway, boulevard, avenue, lane, drive or other
appropriate name. For the purpose of these Regulations, streets shall be
classified as follows
      A.   Major highways. These facilities serve mainly to move through
traffic. State and United States marked routes, as well as some County roads
and important intra-municipal streets, are considered under this
classification. Where a highway is a nonlimited access route, these facilities
also perform a secondary function of providing direct access to abutting land
and thus interconnect principal traffic generators.
      B.   Arterial streets. These facilities serve to accommodate crosstown
traffic and to link the Municipal street network with the major highway system.
Arterial routes provide access to abutting land and generally serve all
principal traffic generators. They are also known as primary or secondary
streets or thoroughfares.
      C.   Collector streets. These facilities serve intra-Municipal movement
of traffic, such as that which moves between a subdivision and an arterial
street. The principal difference between a collector street and a street or
road of a higher classification is the length of trip each principally serves.
Collector routes are intended to supply the abutting property with the same
degree of land service as the local street, while at the same time serving a
larger volume of traffic.
      D.   Local streets. The sole function of a local street is to provide
access to the immediately adjacent property. Local access streets are intended
to carry low volumes of traffic.
   (16)   "Subdivider" means any person responsibly engaged in developing or
improving a tract of land which complies with the definition of a subdivision.
   (17)   "Subdivision" means:
      A.   The division of any parcel of land shown as a unit, as a part of a
unit, or as contiguous units, on the last preceding transfer of ownership
thereof, into two or more parcels, sites or lots, for the purpose, whether
immediate or future, of transfer of ownership, except that the division or
partition of land into parcels of more than five acres not involving any new
street or easement of access, and the sale or exchange of parcels between
adjoining lot owners, where such sale or exchange does not create additional
building sites, shall not be considered a subdivision; or
      B.   The improvement of one or more parcels of land for residential,
commercial or industrial structures or groups of structures involving the
subdivision and allocation of land as streets or other open spaces for common
use by owners, occupants or leaseholders, or as easements for the extension and
maintenance of public sewer, water, storm drainage or other utilities and
facilities, provided that where no new street or road is involved, the division
of land for agricultural purposes, where the resulting parcels are more than
three acres or larger in size, the division of property by interstate
provisions, or the division of property upon court order, shall not be
considered a subdivision.
   (18)   "Subdivision Regulations" means Ordinance 9-76, passed September 9,
1976, codified herein as
Part Two of Title Twelve - the Planning and Zoning Code.
   (19)   "Tentative plat" means a general plat presented for discussion and
subject to change.
   (20)   "Yard" means an open space on the same lot with a building,
unoccupied and unobstructed by any portion of a structure from the ground
upward, except as otherwise provided in these Regulations. In measuring a yard
for the purpose of determining the width of a side yard, the depth of a front
yard or the depth of a rear yard, the horizontal distance between the lot lines
and the main building shall be used.
   (21)   "Zoning Code" means Ordinance 8-13 , passed May 14, 2013 , as
amended, codified as
Titles Four through
Eight of Part Twelve - the Planning and Zoning Code.
   (22)   "Zoning permit" means a permit issued by the Zoning Inspector or his
or her duly authorized representative, stating that the proposed erection,
construction, enlargement or moving of a building or structure referred to
therein complies with the Zoning Code.
      (Ord. 9-76 . Passed 9-9-76 . )

tract shall be considered to have been completely subdivided when all of lots
created as a result of any division are less than five acres.
      (3)   The proposed subdivision is not contrary to applicable subdivision
or zoning regulations. Administrative approval shall not be granted if any
variance from either the Zoning Code or these Subdivision Regulations is
requested. Variances to these Subdivision Regulations may only be granted by
Council, not the Manager, upon written recommendation of the Planning
Commission, and variances to the Zoning Code may only be granted by the Board
of Zoning Appeals.
Council, upon written recommendation of the Planning Commission, has the
authority and responsibility to apply any pertinent provision of these
Subdivision Regulations in the interest of public benefit, as stated in these
Subdivision Regulations. This means that a request for a minor subdivision may
be properly denied and a record subdivision plat may be required in order for
the proposed subdivision not to be contrary to any applicable provision of
these Subdivision Regulations.
   (b)   The Manager shall, within seven working days after submission, take
action upon such proposed division. If the proposed division is acceptable, a
conveyance for such parcel shall be presented to the Manager who shall sign the
conveyance and stamp it “Approved by the Carlisle Manager: No plat required.”
   (c)   The application for a minor subdivision shall include the following:
      (1)   A completed application form;
      (2)   A metes and bounds legal description for each lot being created;
      (3)   A survey plat which conforms to the standards and requirements of
the County Tax Map Department; and
      (4)   The proper fees as required in Section 1262.13.
   (d)   Whenever a minor subdivision abuts a public street designated in the
Official Thoroughfare Plan for the Municipality, the subdivider shall be
required to grant all applicable easements or dedications to the appropriate
governmental jurisdiction. Such easements or dedications shall be the required
amount of right-of-way specified in the Official Thoroughfare Plan for the
Municipality and shall be measured from the centerline of the public street.

98.)
1222.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Whoever constructs any public improvement or portion thereof in
violation of any of the provisions of these Subdivision Regulations is guilty
of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars
($100.00) for each offense. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each
day during or on which a violation occurs or continues.
   (b)   Whoever sells or offers for sale, or leases or offers for lease, any
lot or block within the Municipality, or any addition thereto, or any
resubdivision of any lot or block therein, before all of the requirements of
these Subdivision Regulations have been complied with, is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for

1224.01 INFORMAL CONFERENCE; PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS.
   (a)   When first proposing to subdivide property, an owner or developer
shall submit to the Zoning Inspector, at an informal conference, at least two
copies of a sketch or tentative plat of the proposed subdivision. The Zoning
Inspector shall review the tentative plat or sketch and advise the owner or
developer of such changes as are required to ensure conformity with the Land
Use Plan as to major highways and streets, school and recreation sites,
community facilities, shopping centers or other pre-designated land usage. He
or she shall give such advice as he or she can on sanitation, water supply,
drainage and the relationship to any existing or proposed development, and may
refer such plat to the Municipal Engineer for additional consultation.
   (b)   In the preparation of any subdivision plat, the following shall be
taken into account:
      (1)   Every residential lot in a subdivision shall abut and have access
to a dedicated street or right of way, except that in a division of land
abutting several lots with the intent of conveying the same to abutting owners
without creating additional residence building sites, such parcels need not
abut a public street.
      (2)   No land shall be subdivided for residential use if such land is
considered by the Planning Commission to be unsuitable for such use because of
flooding, improper drainage, inability to provide proper sanitation or any
other feature harmful to the health and safety of future residents or the
community as a whole.
      (3)   Every subdivision shall be planned so as to be in conformity with
the regulations for the zoning district in which it exists.
         (Ord. 9-76. Passed 9-9-76.)
1224.02 APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL; FEE.
   (a)   An owner or developer shall make written application for the approval
of any plat or subdivision, submitted in triplicate, together with at least
four copies of the preliminary plat, and make payment of the filing fee, at
least fourteen days prior to any meeting of the Planning Commission at which a
review is desired. The filing fee shall be in an amount, as determined by
resolution of Council, to meet such costs as may be involved in reviewing
plans, publishing notices, notifying concerned persons and conducting required
public hearings. The fee shall be paid to the Municipality and deposited in the
General Fund.
   (b)   The Zoning Inspector shall file one copy of the receipted application
with the Clerk of Council and receipt the remaining two copies, one of which
shall be attached to the preliminary plat. The subdivider shall keep the third
receipted copy as proof of payment.
(Ord. 9-76. Passed 9-9-76.)
1224.03 REVIEW OF APPLICATIONS; APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL.
   (a)   The Zoning Inspector shall keep one copy of the application for
approval of a preliminary plat, together with such copies of the preliminary
plat as he or she deems necessary, and either forward or request the subdivider
to forward copies of the plat to the various departments and agencies which
will review such plat, including the Municipal Engineer and the County Health
Department.
   (b)   Two copies of the preliminary plat shall be retained by the Planning
Commission for review, and, after having been reviewed by the Commission, both
copies shall be identically noted in colored pencil or ink to show all required
or recommended changes or corrections as of the date of review, including
adopted recommendations or suggestions submitted by the County Health
Department, the Municipal Engineer or any other agency.
   One such copy shall be returned to the subdivider or his or her agent by the
Zoning Inspector, together with a letter either approving or disapproving the
application, with reasons provided, or, where changes or corrections are
minimal, the Commission may give a conditional approval, stating that the plat
is approved subject to compliance with certain requirements, which requirements
shall be set forth in such letter.
   Where it appears that, for any reason, conditions do not warrant either
complete approval or conditional approval, the preliminary plat shall be
returned to the developer or his or her agent setting forth reasons for
disapproval. The plat, revised and corrected, may be resubmitted within one
year without payment of an additional application fee.
(Ord. 9-76. Passed 9-9-76.)
1224.04 EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF APPROVAL.
   (a)   Approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for one year from
the date of approval, and such approval may, at the option of the Planning
Commission and upon request of the applicant, be renewed for one additional
year. If construction plans and specifications and a final plat are not
submitted for at least a reasonable section of such plat within the second
year, the approval shall be deemed to have expired.
   (b)   Where a portion of the land shown on a preliminary plat has been
developed and platted, the approval of the remainder of the preliminary plat
shall be deemed in effect for one year from the date Council approves the final
plat, and unless plans and plats for additional sections are submitted prior to
expiration of the one-year period, the preliminary plat approval shall be
deemed to have lapsed. The submission of such plans or plats for approval shall
extend the approval for one additional year.

   (c)   The plans shall, in every way, equal or exceed the standards set forth
in this chapter.
   (d)   The plans, when submitted to the Municipal Engineer for review, shall
be accompanied with a map showing a division of drainage run-off areas and a
complete set of calculations determining pipe or ditch channel sizes.
   (e)   In the preparation of construction or improvement plans, every
reasonable effort shall be made to avoid placing utility pipelines and storm
and sanitary sewer pipelines (but not including service connections which must
necessarily cross the streets) under pavements or curbs.
   (f)   After the completion of the construction or improvements, a set of
reproducible prints of the essential parts of such plans, showing Aas built@
details and changes, if any, shall be filed with the Zoning Inspector.
   (g)   the owner or his or her agent or engineer shall consult with public
service and utility companies as to the location of underground conduits,

necessary easements for such facilities on the final plat.
   (h)   The approval of plans by the Municipal Engineer, the Mayor, the Zoning
Inspector or the Planning Commission shall not relieve the owner or developer
or his or her engineer of any liability, damages or legal action which may
result from faulty, careless or negligent design or construction observed
within the guarantee period.
(Ord. 9-76. Passed 9-9-76.)
1230.03 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES.
   No final plat shall be approved until all the improvements necessary and
agreed to by the owner or developer, or required by the Planning Commission,
have been completed to the satisfaction of Council or ensured by the owner. A
credit at a local bank by the owner in an amount equal to 110 percent of the
Municipal Engineer's estimated cost of total improvements shall be confirmed by
notice, in writing, to the Municipality from a bank. A statement in a form
approved by Council and signed by the developer shall state that 110 percent of
the contract price is credited at a bank for withdrawal, only with the approval
of Council, as shown in the Bond Agreement outlined in Appendix I, form h.,
following this chapter. Both instruments shall state that upon failure of the
developer to satisfactorily complete or make necessary repairs or alterations
to the improvements, the Municipality may do so and shall use the remaining
credit for this purpose.
    The date upon which final payment to the pavement contractor is approved by
the Municipality shall be deemed the date of tentative acceptance for all
improvements, including sewers and utility pipelines, from which date the
subdivider is liable for all necessary maintenance and repairs for one year.
If, at the termination of the one-year guarantee period, all roadways,
pavements, utilities, sewers, etc., are found to be in good and satisfactory
condition, the same shall be given final acceptance by the Municipality and the
remaining ten percent of the bond shall be released.

supply on each lot in the subdivision, subject to compliance with all
recommended design standards of the County Department of Health and the State.
Such individual systems are not encouraged by the Municipality.
      (Ord. 9-76. Passed 9-9-76.)
1230.08 STORM DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS.
   (a)   Adequate surface and subsurface drainageways for the removal of storm
water shall be provided by the subdivider. The extent to which storm drainage
facilities are required shall be based upon an analysis of need, prepared for
the subdivider by a registered professional engineer. The analysis shall be
based upon the reactional method of computing storm water run-off, using the
maximum one-hour rainfall to be expected at a ten-year frequency. Times of
concentration, soil infiltration rates and other variable factors to be used in
the analysis shall be discussed with and approved by the Municipal Engineer
during the preliminary consideration of the subdivision.
   (b)   A storm water sewerage system, which shall be separate and independent
of the sanitary sewerage system, with surface inlets, shall be provided by the
subdivider in all cases where curbs and gutters are to be installed and
whenever available evidence indicates that such a system is necessary due to
the inadequacy of the natural surface drainage.
   (c)   All nonsanitary water, including sump pumping, roof drain tiles and
the like, shall be connected to the public storm drainage system. Under no
circumstances shall the subdivider, developer, builder or occupant be permitted

outlined in Chapter

requirement shall constitute a violation of this Zoning Code. Approval shall
automatically be void if, for any reason, the conditional use shall cease for
more than one year.

enactment, unless:
      (1)   The final development plan is approved for uses that require a

and non-residential conditional use that requires additional parking spaces to
be provided may be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1246.25 RE-APPLICATION FOR A CONDITIONAL USE APPROVAL.

a conditional use unless the re-application is based on a revised application
that addresses the justification for the denial of the initial application. A
re-application shall comply with all the requirements of this Chapter,

are not addressed by this Zoning Code, this section provides the procedure by
which the Planning Commission may make a determination that a new use is
similar to a use permitted in a district.

any other district;

uses in the district to which it is proposed or is similar to a specific use
permitted in that district.
   (b)   Assignment to Districts. If the Planning Commission approves the
proposed similar use, then the similar use shall be added to those districts
that allow the principal or conditional use that is most similar, as identified
in the Commission's determination.

         C.   Payment of the application fee;
         D.   A list of all property owners lying within 500 feet of any part

and permanent parcel numbers and lot numbers;
         E.   Any other documents deemed necessary by the Planning and Zoning
Administrator.
   (c)   Review for Completeness. Within thirty (30) days after receiving an
application for variance, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall review
the submitted application for completeness and compliance with the applicable
submission requirements. If the application is deemed insufficient, the
Planning and Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant of the necessary
changes or additional information needed. When the application is deemed
complete and the application fee has been paid, the Planning and Zoning
Administrator shall officially accept the application for consideration of the
action(s) requested on the date such determination is made and place it on the
Board of Zoning Appeals' agenda.
   (d)   Review by the Board. According to the procedures established for
appeals in Sections
1250.07 and
1250.13, the Board shall hold a public hearing and give notice of the same. The
Board shall review each application for a variance to determine if it complies
with the purpose and intent of this Zoning Code and evidence demonstrates that
the literal enforcement of this Zoning Code will result in practical difficulty
or unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Area Variance. The following factors shall be considered and
weighed by the Board to determine practical difficulty:
         A.   Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable
generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district. Examples of
such special conditions or circumstances are exceptional irregularity;
narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot; or proximity to non-conforming
and inharmonious uses, structures or conditions.
         B.   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return
or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance;
         C.   Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary
to make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures;
         D.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
         E.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sewer, trash pickup;
         F.   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge
of the zoning restrictions;
         G.   Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of
actions of the owner;
         H.   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be achieved
through some method other than a variance;
         I.   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance;
         J.   Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district; and
         K.   Whether a literal interpretation of the provisions of this Code
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this Code.
      (2)   Use Variance. In order to grant a use variance, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall determine that strict compliance with the terms of this Zoning
Code will result in unnecessary hardship to the applicant. The applicant must
demonstrate such hardship by clear and convincing evidence that all of the
following criteria are satisfied:
         A.   The property cannot be put to any economically viable use under
any of the permitted uses in the zoning district in which the property is
located;
         B.   The variance requested stems from a condition which is unique to
the property at issue and not ordinarily found in the same zone or district;
         C.   The hardship condition is not created by actions of the
applicant;
         D.   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights
of adjacent property owners or residents;
         E.   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public
health, safety or general welfare;
         F.   The variance will be consistent with the general spirit and
intent of the Planning and Zoning Code; and
         G.   The variance sought is the minimum that will afford relief to the
applicant.
   (e)   Requests for Additional Information. The Board of Zoning Appeals may
request that the applicant supply additional information that the Board deems
necessary to review and evaluate the request for a variance.
   (f)   Additional Conditions and Safeguards. The Board may further prescribe
any conditions and safeguards that it deems necessary to ensure that the
objectives of the regulation(s) or provision(s) to which the variance applies
will be met.
   (g)   Action by the Board. The Board shall act according to the procedures
established for appeals in Section
1250.13.
      (1)   The Board shall either:
         A.   Approve,
         B.   Approve with conditions, or
         C.   Disapprove the request for appeal, variance, or exception.
      (2)   Any interested party to an appeals or an application for a variance
may make written request that the Board issue findings and conclusions of fact
in support of any final decision entered by the Board. Any request for findings
and conclusions of fact must be made in writing within ten calendar days of the
Board's decision as approved in the meeting minutes. The Board shall issue such
findings and conclusions. Nothing herein shall extend the time for the filing
of an appeal pursuant to Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (3)   The Board shall have the power, in specific cases, to vary the
application of certain provisions of this Code in order that the public health,
safety, morals and general welfare may be safeguarded and substantial justice
done.
   (h)   Term and Extension of Variance. Variances shall expire one year from
the date of their enactment, unless prior thereto, the applicant commences
actual construction in accordance with the granted variance or an extension of
time has been granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals. There shall be no
modification of variances except by further consideration of the Board. Once
the time limit pursuant to this Section has expired, a request for a variance
shall be considered to be a new application for a variance and shall meet all
requirements for application and review pursuant to this Section.
      (Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1250.19 APPEAL OF BOARD'S DECISION.
   Decisions by the Board granting or denying variances shall be final within
the Municipality, except that an appeal therefrom may be taken to the Court of
Common Pleas pursuant to Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code by an interested
party, including the Municipality and its officials.

(Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1252.07 IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
   The improvements required are determined according to the accessibility of a
sewer system and a public water supply, the relationship to existing or planned

   (a)   Guarantees. The developer shall execute financial guarantees and shall
file such financial guarantees with Carlisle prior to approval of a development
plan or certification of a final plat, if the applicant does not propose to

certification of the final plat or approval of the development plan. Such
guarantees may be in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit or a certified
check.
   (b)   Terms. The terms of such guarantees shall be determined by the Law
Director with confirmation by the Engineer.
   (c)   Amount of Guarantee. The financial guarantees shall be in an amount
equal to the estimated total costs of materials and labor required to install

completed, a reduction in the bonds or partial withdrawal of funds equal to the
estimated costs of such completed improvements may be authorized.
   (d)   Agreements.
      (1)   Where the subdivider chooses to post a performance guarantee in
lieu of completion of those physical improvements shown on the approved
engineering plan and/or final plat in order to allow recordation prior to
completion and acceptance of all required public improvements, he or she shall
enter into a subdivision agreement, approved as to content and form by the Law
Director, with Carlisle prior to approval of the final plat by the Planning
Commission. Carlisle shall provide to the subdivider a sample subdivision
agreement during review of the final plat.
      (2)   When an applicant for a development plan is required to construct
the improvements shown on an approved development plan, the applicant shall
enter into an agreement, approved as to content and form by the Law Department,
with Carlisle prior to approval of the development plan.
         (Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)

the street and utility improvements as determined by the Engineer. The deposit
shall be in the form of a bond, with the developer as principal and with a
surety company authorized to do business in the State of Ohio; a certified
check; or an irrevocable letter of credit. The deposit shall be in a form
acceptable to the Law Director.
(Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)

against and from any and all loss, cost, damage, liability, and expense on
account of damage to property of, or injury to or death of, the parties or a
third person caused by or in any way whatsoever attributable to the
construction of the improvements and the use of streets delineated on a
subdivision plat/plan or a development plan during construction. The developer
shall further agree, but without limiting its liability to indemnify the
Municipality, to carry liability insurance contracts in an amount determined by
the Municipality for injury to or death of persons, and for damage to or
destruction of property, which insurance contracts shall include the
Municipality as a named insured. The developer shall further agree to maintain

shall transfer, sell, agree to sell or negotiate to sell any land by reference
to, exhibition of or by the use of a plan or plat of a subdivision before such
plat has been approved, certified, and recorded in the manner prescribed in
this Zoning Code. Any sale or transfer contrary to the provisions of this
section is void.
   The description of such lot, parcel or tract by metes and bounds in the deed
of transfer shall not serve to exempt the seller from the penalty provided in
Chapter
1254. Carlisle may enjoin such sale or agreement by a civil action in any court
of competent jurisdiction.

changing conditions in the areas of zoning districts affected or in Carlisle
generally, and, if so, the nature of such changed or changing conditions.
      (Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1256.13 AMENDMENTS TO CHANGE ZONING DISTRICTS OR ZONING CLASSIFICATIONS OF
PROPERTIES.
      When a proposed amendment would result in a change of zoning
classification of any property, the Planning Commission and Council should
consider whether:
   (a)   The change in classification would be consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan or other adopted plans and policies.
   (b)   The change in classification would be consistent with the intent and
purposes of this Zoning Code.
   (c)   The proposed amendment is made necessary because of changed or
changing conditions in the area affected, and if so, the nature of such changed
or changing conditions.
   (d)   The uses that would be permitted on the property if it were
reclassified would be compatible with the uses permitted on other property in
the immediate vicinity. The Planning Commission may suggest conditions and
restrictions on the uses that would be permitted on the property if it were
reclassified in order to attain compatibility with the uses permitted on other
property in the immediate vicinity.
   (e)   The uses that would be permitted on the property if it were
reclassified would have an adverse environmental or health impact on the
immediate surrounding area in terms of acceptable air, noise, light, or water
quality standards.
   (f)   Adequate utility, sewer, and water facilities, and all other needed
public services exist or can be provided to serve the uses that would be
permitted on a property if it were reclassified.
   (g)   The amount of vacant land with the same zoning classification as
proposed for the subject property, particularly in the vicinity of the subject
property, and any special circumstances, if any, make a substantial part of
such vacant land unavailable for development.
   (h)   The proposed amendment would correct an error in the application of
this Zoning Code as applied to the subject property.
      (Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)

1258.03   Lawful nonconformance.
1258.05   Nonconforming uses of buildings, structures or land.
1258.07   Nonconforming buildings and structures.
1258.09   Nonconforming lots.
1258.11   Nonconforming parking facilities.

1258.01 INTENT.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to recognize the existence of uses,
buildings, lots and structures that lawfully existed at the time of this Zoning
Code's enactment, or amendment thereto, but which now do not conform with one
or more of the regulations contained in this Zoning Code. Nonconforming uses of
structures and/or land are declared by this Code to be incompatible with the
provisions applicable in the district in which such uses are located. In
addition, it is recognized that there are lots, buildings, parking lots, signs,
and other structures that do not conform to the zoning requirements.
Regulations for the continuance, maintenance, repair, restoring, moving and
discontinuance of nonconforming uses, nonconforming buildings and nonconforming
lots are established in order to achieve the following purposes:
   (a)   To permit the continuance but control of nonconforming uses so as to
minimize any adverse effects the uses might have on the adjoining properties
and development;
   (b)   To regulate their maintenance and repair;
   (c)   To restrict their rebuilding if substantially destroyed;
   (d)   To require their permanent discontinuance if not operated for certain
periods of time;
   (e)   To require conformity if a nonconforming use is discontinued, to bring
about eventual conformity of all uses in accordance with the objectives of the
Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Code of Carlisle;
   (f)   To establish regulations for the development of nonconforming lots
and;
   (g)   To establish regulations for the use, restoration, reconstruction, and
expansion of structures that do not conform to the standards set forth in the
Zoning Code.
      (Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1258.03 LAWFUL NONCONFORMANCE.
   (a)   The lawful use of any dwelling, building or structure and of any land
or premises as existing and lawful at the time of enacting this Code, or any
amendments thereto, may be continued although such use does not conform to the
provisions of this Code. The completion, restoration, reconstruction, extension
or substitution of nonconforming uses shall be subject to the provisions and
conditions set forth in this Chapter.
   (b)   The provisions of this Chapter shall also apply to any building,
structure, land or other use hereafter becoming nonconforming as a result of
amendments made to this Zoning Code or Zoning Map.
   (c)   A nonconforming lot, use, building or structure does not include
nonconformity with regulations pursuant to a legally granted variance from a
zoning regulation.
   (d)   Ordinary repairs, or repair or replacement of non-bearing walls,
fixtures, wiring, or plumbing may be performed on a nonconforming structure or
on any portion of a structure that contains a nonconforming use provided that
the cubic content shall not be increased and no structural parts shall be
replaced except when required by law to restore such building or structure to a
safe condition or to make the building or structure conform to the regulations
of the district in which it is located.
(Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1258.05 NONCONFORMING USES OF BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES, OR LAND.
   A nonconforming use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful
and does not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the following
regulations:
   (a)   Change or Substitution to Another Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming
use of a building, structure or land shall not be changed or substituted to
another nonconforming use unless:
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals, on appeal, finds that the use proposed
is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing
nonconforming use, and that the use proposed is in less conflict with the
character of uses permitted in the applicable zoning district than the existing
nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of Zoning Appeals may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with other
provisions of this Zoning Code and when made a part of the terms under which
the change is granted.
         A.   Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a less intensive use,
such use shall not thereafter be changed to a more intensive nonconforming use.
         B.   Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a use permitted in the
district in which the lot is located, it shall cease to be considered a
nonconforming use. Upon such compliance, no nonconforming use shall be made,
resumed or reinstated.
         C.   Violation of any conditions and/or safeguards prescribed shall be
deemed a violation of this Zoning Code and shall be punishable under Chapter
1254.
      (2)   An application is filed with the Board of Zoning Appeals and such
application includes payment of the fee established by the Municipality and the
items required in Chapter
1246.
   (b)   Land Occupied by Nonconforming Use.
      (1)   Expansion of Nonconforming Use of Land. A nonconforming use of land
shall not be physically enlarged, increased, nor extended to occupy a greater
area of land than was occupied by the use at the time it became nonconforming,
unless otherwise specified.
      (2)   Relocation of Nonconforming Use of Land. A nonconforming use of
land shall not be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel
other than those portions occupied by the use at the time it became
nonconforming.
   (c)   Structures Occupied by Nonconforming Use.
      (1)   Extension of Nonconforming Use within Building. A nonconforming use
of an existing structure may be extended throughout any parts of a building
that were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption
or amendment to this Zoning Code. However, no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building not previously occupied by such
nonconforming use.
      (2)   Expansion of Building(s). No such building shall be enlarged or
expanded to increase the nonconforming use. No additional structures shall be
constructed in connection with such nonconforming use.
      (3)   Alteration or Reconstruction of a Building Occupied by a
Nonconforming Use. No building or structure occupied by a nonconforming use
shall be altered, improved, or reconstructed except when the use is changed to
a use permitted in the district in which it is located, or upon prior approval
of the Board of Zoning Appeals provided the cumulative cost of the alteration,
reconstruction, or improvement permitted by the Board of Zoning Appeals does
not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the building's replacement value.
      (4)   Damage or Destruction. In the event a building or structure that is
occupied by a nonconforming use is destroyed by any means to the extent of more
than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement value, it shall not be rebuilt,
restored or reoccupied for any use unless such use conforms to the use
regulations of the district in which the building or structure is located.
   (d)   Discontinuance of Use. Whenever a nonconforming use of a building,
part of a building, lot or part of a lot is discontinued for more than one
year, such discontinuance shall constitute voluntary abandonment of such use
and any subsequent use of the building, part of a building, lot or part of a
lot shall conform to the use regulations specified by this Code for the
district in which such land is located.
      (Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1258.07 NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   A nonconforming building or structure may continue to be used or occupied by
a use permitted in the district in which it is located so long as it remains
otherwise lawful and does not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the
following provisions:
   (a)   Additions and Moving. A nonconforming building or structure shall not
be added to, enlarged or moved unless the addition(s) or part(s) moved is made
to conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (b)   Restoration of Damaged Building or Structure. If a nonconforming
building or structure is damaged or destroyed by any means, those portions so
destroyed or damaged may be restored to the original footprint and floor area
of the building or structure, provided the reconstruction is begun within
twelve (12) months of the damage or destruction and the cumulative replacement
costs do not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the replacement cost of the building
or structure at the time of such damage. Any restoration that exceeds the
original footprint and/or floor area shall comply with sub-section
1258.07(a).
   (c)   Change in Principal Use of Building. The principal use of a
nonconforming building may be changed to any other use permitted in the
district in which it is located so long as the new use complies with all
regulations of this Zoning Code specified for such use, except the regulations
to which the building did not conform prior to the change in use.
   (d)   Variances from district regulations on area, lot coverage, lot width,
height, yards, and location on the lot may be granted by the Board of Appeals
where necessary and where such appeal for a variance meets the requirements of
Section
1250.17(d)(1). The Planning and Zoning Administrator may allow the extension of
an existing nonconforming building line if the extension maintains the same or
creates a greater distance from the lot line.
      (Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1258.09 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   A lot of record that, on the effective date of this Zoning Code, or any
amendment thereto, does not comply with the lot area and/or lot width
regulations of the district in which the lot is located may be used as follows:
    (a)   Existing Buildings on Lots of Record.
      (1)   Existing Building on a Nonresidential Lot. If the lot is occupied
by a building, such building shall be maintained and may be repaired,
modernized or altered, provided that the building shall not be enlarged in
floor area unless the enlarged section(s) complies with all regulations of this
Zoning Code, except the lot area and lot width regulations of the district in
which the lot is located.
      (2)   Existing Dwelling on a Residential Lot. If the lot is occupied by a
dwelling, such dwelling shall be maintained and may be repaired, modernized or
altered, provided that the building shall not be enlarged in floor area unless
the enlarged section(s) complies with all regulations of this Zoning Code,
except for the lot area and lot width regulations of the district in which the
lot is located.
         A.   Structural alterations or extensions of a residential structure
which is nonconforming only by reason of lot size or lot width shall be
permitted upon approval of the Planning and Zoning Administrator.
         B.   The number of dwelling units shall not be increased unless all
regulations, including lot area, are complied with.
   (b)   Vacant Single Nonconforming Lot of Record.
      (1)   Single Nonconforming Lot of Record in a Residential District. A
nonconforming lot in a Single-family Residential District that is in separate
ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership
shall be permitted to be developed as a site for a single-family dwelling and
customary accessory buildings.
         A.   Such dwelling and its accessory uses shall comply with all
regulations of this Zoning Code, except for the lot area and lot width
regulations of the district in which the lot is located.
         B.   Review and approval of development on such lots of record shall
be conducted according to the procedures set forth in Section
1246.07.
         C.   Variances of requirements from district regulations other than
lot area or lot width shall be obtained through action of the Board of Zoning
Appeals as provided in this Chapter.
      (2)   A vacant nonconforming lot in a Multi-family or non-residential
district may be used for any use permitted in the district in which it is
located when the development of such lot meets all requirements of the district
in which it is located, including the maximum lot coverage and minimum setback
requirements, except for the minimum lot area and lot width requirements.
No use that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size
for a particular district shall be permitted on a nonconforming lot. Review and
approval of development on such lots of record shall be conducted according to
the development plan review requirements set forth in Chapter
1246.
   (c)   Lots in Combination. If a vacant nonconforming lot in any district
adjoins one or more lots in common ownership on the effective date of this
Zoning Code, or applicable amendment thereto, such lots shall be replatted to
create conforming lots as a prerequisite for development.
      (Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1258.11 NONCONFORMING PARKING FACILITIES.
   A building or use existing lawfully at the time of this Zoning Code, or an
amendment thereto, became or becomes effective, but which does not comply with
the off-street parking regulations for the use may continue without such
parking facilities. In the event an existing building is altered or a use is
changed or substituted, in accordance with these regulations, then additional
off-street parking spaces shall be provided in compliance with Chapter
1284, if this Code requires such additional parking spaces as a result of the
proposed changes.
(Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1258.13 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   A sign, lawfully existing at the time this Zoning Code, or any amendment
thereto, became or becomes effective, but which fails to conform to the sign
regulations of the district in which it is located is a nonconforming sign.
Nonconforming signs shall comply with the regulations set forth in Section
1286.19.
(Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1258.15 NONCONFORMING SITE CONDITIONS EXISTING AT TIME OF DEVEOPMENT PLAN
REVIEW.
     If nonconforming site conditions exist when a revised development plan is
required pursuant to Chapter
1246, then such site condition(s) must be brought into compliance with district
regulations, unless the Planning Commission determines that such conformance
cannot be reasonably achieved because of existing site conditions. In such
case, the Planning Commission shall approve a development plan that reduces the
existing nonconforming site condition(s) to the maximum extent practicable.
(Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1258.17 EXISTING USE DEEMED CONDITIONAL USE; PERMIT REQUIRED FOR CHANGE.
    Any lawfully existing use that, at the time of its establishment, was not
classified as a conditional use, but which now, because of the passage of this
Zoning Code, or amendment thereto, is listed as a conditional use in the
district in which it is located, shall be deemed without further action to be a
conditional use. Any change, modification, enlargement or alteration of such
use, site development conditions or signs, or change in operations shall only
be permitted upon review and approval by the Planning Commission according to
the procedures for conditional uses set forth in Chapter
1246.
(Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1258.19 DETERMINATION OF NONCONFORMING STATUS.
   At the time of application for a zoning certificate or request for variance,
or upon the request of the Planning and Zoning Administrator regarding a
nonconforming lot, building, structure or use, the property owner shall submit
sufficient evidence to verify that such lot, building, structure, or use was
lawfully created or established in accordance with the zoning regulations in
existence at that time. If the evidence submitted indicates the lot, building,
structure or use was legally established and has since become nonconforming
because of the establishment of or amendment to this Zoning Code, the Planning
and Zoning Administrator shall issue a Certificate of Nonconforming Use. This
certificate shall specify the reason why the use, building, structure or lot is
nonconforming, and for nonconforming uses shall also include a description of
the extent and kind of use made of the property in question, the portion of the
structure or land used for the nonconforming use, and the extent that
dimensional requirements are nonconforming. (Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1258.21 COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION WITH ZONING CERTIFICATE.
   Nothing in this Zoning Code shall prohibit the completion of the
construction and use of buildings for which a zoning certificate has been
issued prior to the effective date of this Zoning Code, or amendments thereto,
provided that construction is carried on diligently and without interruption
and the entire building is completed within two (2) years after the issuance of
the zoning certificate. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the
placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a
permanent manner. Where demolition or removal of an existing building has begun
preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be
actual construction.

   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the
aforesaid districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the following rules
shall apply:
   (a)   Where the designation of a boundary line on the zoning map coincides
with the location of a street or alley, the centerline of such street or alley
shall be construed to be the boundary of such district.
   (b)   Where the district boundaries do not coincide with the location of
streets or alleys, but do coincide with lot lines, such lot lines shall be
construed to be the boundary of such district.
   (c)   Where the district boundaries do not coincide with the location of
streets, alleys, or lot lines, the district boundaries shall be determined by
the use of the scale shown on the Official Zoning Map described in Section
1260.03.
   (d)   All streets, alleys, public ways, waterways, and railroad rights-of-
way, if not otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the
same zone as the property immediately abutting upon such streets, alleys,
public ways, waterways and railroad rights-of-way.
   (e)   Where the centerline of a street, alley, public way, waterway, or
railroad right-of-way serves as a district boundary, the zoning of such areas,
unless otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be the same as
that of the abutting property up to the centerline.
   (f)   Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by official
action as provided by law, the zoning district adjoining the each side of such
public way shall be automatically extended to the center of such vacation and
all areas included in the vacation shall then and henceforth be subject to all
regulations of the extended.
   (g)   All uncertainties and disputes concerning the exact location of zoning
district boundaries shall be resolved by the Board of Zoning Appeals according
to the rules and regulations that it may adopt.

residential neighborhoods and to limit the establishment of non-residential
uses to those that are compatible with the intended low-density neighborhood
character. The stipulated density is intended to provide for areas of suburban
character in the community.
      (2)   The R-2 Single-Family District is established to promote, preserve
and protect medium-low density predominantly single-family neighborhoods in
Carlisle.

CHAPTER 1266
Planned Development Overlay District
1266.01     Purpose and application.
1266.03    Establishment of Planned Development District.
1266.05    General development criteria.
1266.07    Compliance with existing development standards.
1266.09     Procedures.
1266.11     Submission requirements.
1266.13     Plan approval criteria.
 
1266.01 PURPOSE AND APPLICATION.
   (a)   Purpose. The Planned Development Overlay District (PDOD) regulations
are based on the premise that the ultimate quality of a built environment or
development proposal is determined not only by the type, character and
allocation of land uses, but also by the way in which such land uses are
executed. In many cases, the subdivision regulations and standard zoning
district regulations and procedures do not adequately regulate the design of
buildings or enable the range of uses in a single zoning district that are
appropriate in Carlisle.
      (1)   The purposes of the Planned Development Overlay District
regulations are to:
         A.   Provide an opportunity for a mix of land uses otherwise not
permitted within the standard municipal zoning district classifications.
         B.   Allow the creation of development standards that respect the
unique characteristics, natural quality and beauty of the site and the
immediate vicinity and protect the community's natural resources by avoiding
development on, and destruction of, sensitive environmental areas.
         C.   Enable greater review of design characteristics to ensure that
the development project is properly integrated into its surroundings and is
compatible with adjacent development.
         D.   Assure compatibility between proposed land uses within and around
the Planned Development Overlay District through appropriate development
controls.
         E.   Pursue the housing and economic development goals of Carlisle.
         F.   Promote efficient and economic use of land and reduce
infrastructure costs through unified development.
         G.   Establish objective criteria for plan review that ensures
conformity to community standards.
      (2)   The procedures established for Planned Development Overlay
Districts are designed to encourage:
         A.   Unified development projects that exhibit creative planning and
design in ways that cannot be achieved through a standard zoning district or
subdivision regulation, yet are consistent with all applicable plans, including
but not limited to, the Comprehensive Plan, and are compatible with contiguous
land uses and the intent of this Zoning Code.
         B.   Imaginative architectural design.
         C.   Flexibility in building styles and types.
         D.   Proper relationships between buildings, between developments and
between structures and the land.
         E.   The development of the land in an orderly, coordinated and
comprehensive manner consistent with accepted land planning, landscape
architecture practices and engineering principles according to approved
development plans.
   (b)   Application. The Planned Development Overlay District regulations
assist in accomplishing these purposes by establishing review steps that
combine the request for a zoning district change with the development plan
review process, and when applicable, the subdivision process. Subsequent plan
review following the zoning district change also requires simultaneous review
of subdivision plats.
      (1)   Each Planned Development Overlay District shall be considered a
separate and unique zoning district wherein a preliminary development plan,
including associated text depicting the specific development standards and
development commitments, is adopted simultaneously with the adoption of the
Planned Development Overlay District designation. The preliminary development
plan shall apply only to the property within that particular Planned
Development Overlay District.
      (2)   The preliminary development plan adopted at the time of rezoning to
the Planned Development Overlay District shall be prepared in accordance with
the provisions of this Chapter and the requirements contained herein and shall
take precedence over any conflicting regulations contained in this Zoning Code.
   (c)   Ownership. The Planned Development Overlay District shall be an
integrated, unified development project and the entire project area shall be in
single ownership or joint ownership and/or control at the time the application
is made for the PDOD designation so that all property owners are applicants.
Any transfer of land within the development resulting in ownership within the
development by two (2) or more parties after an application has been filed
shall not alter the applicability of the regulations contained herein. A
preliminary development plan approved in accordance with these or previous
regulations for a Planned Development Overlay District shall be binding upon
the owners, their successors and assigns and shall limit and control the
issuance and validity of all certificates of zoning compliance, except as
provided for in Section
1266.09(c)(4).
(Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1266.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   A Planned Development Overlay District that is adopted after the effective
date of these regulations shall be established according to the following:
   (a)   All rezonings to a Planned Development Overlay District shall be
designated on the Zoning Map as a PDOD.
   (b)   A request for rezoning land to a Planned Development Overlay District
designation shall be made according to Chapter
1256.
   (c)   A preliminary development plan shall be reviewed by the Planning
Commission and Council according to Section
1266.09 and a preliminary development plan and supporting documentation shall
be adopted at the time of rezoning.
   (d)   Detailed final development plans shall be reviewed and acted upon by
the Planning Commission according to Section
1266.09.
   (e)   A preliminary subdivision plat may be reviewed simultaneously with a
preliminary development plan. A final subdivision plat shall be reviewed
simultaneously with a final development plan, unless a final plat is not
required for completion of the project. All subdivision plats shall be reviewed
and approved according to the applicable Subdivision Regulations, except as
otherwise provided for in this Chapter.
      (Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1266.05 GENERAL DEVELOPMENT CRITERIA.
   A Planned Development shall be designed and depicted on the preliminary
development plan and final development plan in accordance with the following
General Development Criteria:
   (a)   Plan Design. The proposed Planned Development (PD) shall be designed
in accordance with accepted planning principles, including the planning and
development principles included in this Chapter, to ensure that the use of
land, buildings and other structures; the building location, bulk, layout,
arrangement, design, and height; the percentages of lot areas that may be
occupied; the setback of buildings; the sizes of yards and other spaces; and
the density of population are in compliance with the purposes and objectives of
the PDOD regulations as set forth in the Purpose of this Chapter.
   (b)   Permitted and Conditional Uses. A planned development may include any
combination of uses when such use(s) are found to be compatible with one
another and in keeping with the intent of these development criteria, provided
the proposed location of the uses will not adversely affect adjacent property
and/or the public health, safety and general welfare.
      (1)   The list of specific uses to be included in the proposed planned
development shall be clearly delineated in the preliminary development plan and
its supporting documentation.
      (2)   Uses shall be identified as either permitted uses or conditional
uses.
      (3)   Listed uses shall be defined by their customary name or
identification, except where they are specifically defined or limited in this
Zoning Code.
      (4)   Any listed use may be limited to areas delineated on the
preliminary development plan.
   (c)   Planning and Development Principles. The proposed planned development
shall be designed in accordance with the following planning and development
regulations:
      (1)   Land Use.
         A.   A PDOD may be approved in all districts provided the PDOD meets
the regulations in this Chapter and all other applicable regulations in this
Zoning Code.
         B.   Buildings and uses within the proposed development shall be
located to reduce any adverse influences and to protect and enhance the
character of areas adjacent to the development;
         C.   Whenever a proposed development includes areas of a higher
intensity than that permitted in adjacent areas, the location and arrangement
of use areas shall include appropriate buffers, open spaces, setbacks, or other
transitional areas to ensure compatibility with the lower intensity areas.
         D.   Buildings, structures and parking areas shall be designed and
located within the planned development in ways that conserve environmentally
sensitive or unique natural, historic, or cultural features, and minimize
environmental impacts.
         E.   When calculating density for the PDOD, area devoted to non-
residential land uses shall not be included in the density calculations.
      (2)   Arrangement of Buildings, Yards and Setbacks.
         A.   The physical relationship of buildings and other site
improvements to one another and the surrounding open space, as created by
building size, mass, height, shape, and setback, shall result in a harmonious
development within the planned development and adjacent to it.
         B.   The bulk and height of buildings within the proposed development
shall be compatible with the surrounding development and sufficiently buffered
from the surrounding development to mitigate any potential adverse impact(s).
         C.   The setback of all buildings from the perimeter of the total
tract shall be a minimum of fifty (50) feet. The setback area shall be retained
and maintained as landscaped open space free of streets and off-street parking
areas.
      (3)   Landscaping, Screening and Buffering.
         A.   The pattern of landscaping shall be coordinated in design and
type of materials, mounding and fencing used. Landscaping may vary in density,
spacing and other treatments to reflect variations of topography, existing
landscape or land uses.
         B.   Privacy for residential buildings shall be maintained through the
use of landscaping, screening and buffering.
         C.   Appropriate buffer zones with adequate landscaping shall be
provided between the proposed development and adjacent areas.
         D.   Alternative design approaches to meet the intent of the landscape
regulations may be incorporated.
      (4)   Open Space. Adequate open spaces shall be integrated throughout the
development to meet the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan. A planned
development that includes residential uses shall provide thirty percent (30%)
of the gross acreage as open space. Such open space shall be located and
designed as follows:
         A.   Open space shall be sufficiently aggregated to create large
useable areas of planned open space. Left-over fragments of land from the
subdivision process or land left-over from maximizing density shall not be
included as useable open space, e.g., the unusual strips of land created
between two (2) adjoining cul-de-sacs.
         B.   Open space shall conserve significant topographic, natural and
historical features within the planned development to the extent practicable.
         C.   Open space shall provide a scenic natural environment along
existing public streets characterized by large building setbacks that enable
the preservation of natural features.
         D.   All open space shall be easily accessible to residents of the
planned development.
         E.   Where possible, open space areas shall be connected with open
space areas on abutting parcels, and wherever possible, by open space
corridors.
         F.   Open space shall not be less than fifty (50) feet in width at any
point, unless the Planning Commission deems that a lesser width is appropriate,
such as when connecting open space areas on adjacent parcels or creating scenic
walking trails.
         G.   All principal and accessory buildings shall be setback fifteen
(15) feet from any designated open space.
         H.   Land area devoted to the following shall not be included as
meeting the open space requirement:
            1.   Public rights-of-way;
            2.   Parking areas, access drives, common drives and driveways,
except as otherwise permitted by the Planning Commission when providing access
to the open space;
            3.   Required setbacks for buildings and parking areas from the
project boundaries;
            4.   Private yards within subdivided lots; and,
            5.   Open space composed of the 100-year floodplain, wetlands
(including woodlands with wetland soils), steep slopes, significant wildlife
habitats, ridge lines, hilltops, stands of mature hardwood trees, and historic
and archaeological features. The Planning Commission may grant an exception to
this requirement based on the existing street network, topography, the
proximity and nature of surrounding land uses, and similar factors.
         I.   Open space may be used for outdoor active or passive recreation.
Any open space intended to be devoted to recreational activities shall be of a
usable size and shape for the intended purposes as determined by the Planning
Commission. Where deemed appropriate by the Planning Commission, recreation
areas shall be provided with sufficient parking and appropriate access.
         J.   Open space shall be prohibited from further subdivision or
development by deed restriction, conservation easement, or other agreement in a
form acceptable to the Carlisle Law Director and duly recorded in the Office of
the Recorder of Deeds of the County. Such recording shall take place before a
construction permit, such as a building permit, of any kind is issued.
      (5)   Protection of Natural Features.
         A.   A riparian buffer of twenty (20) feet shall be provided along the
entire length and on both sides of a river or perennial stream channel.
Walkways may be permitted to be located within riparian buffers when the
Planning Commission determines that such will create minimal change to the
riparian buffer.
         B.   The 100-year floodplain shall be protected. The most recent Flood
Insurance Study prepared by the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development shall be used to determine the 100-year floodplain.
         C.   Wetlands that are to be retained in their natural state within
the planned development shall be protected. A buffer area not less than twenty
(20) feet in width measured from the edge of the delineated wetland shall be
provided along the entire perimeter of the designated wetland. The buffer area
shall not be disturbed and shall be retained in its natural state.
      (6)   Pedestrian Circulation Systems. A pedestrian circulation system
shall be included and designed to provide convenient and safe pedestrian access
throughout the planned development, and to connect to neighboring developments
and community facilities. The pedestrian circulation system may include
sidewalks and other walkways not located along streets. Sidewalks shall meet
the latest Carlisle engineer standards.
      (7)   Bike Paths and Other Trail Systems. Trail systems for bikes and
other purposes should be included and designed in accordance with the latest
Carlisle engineering standards or other adopted policy documents. Such trail
systems shall have a minimum width of eight (8) feet and be properly buffered
from any adjacent residential areas if the trail is not located along or within
the right-of-way of a public street.
      (8)   Street Design and Vehicular Circulation.
         A.   The proposed vehicular circulation system in the planned
development shall provide adequate connections to the existing street network.
         B.   The area of the project devoted to streets and related pavement
should be the minimum necessary to provide adequate and safe movement and
access.
         C.   Street alignments should be designed to conserve natural features
and minimize the need for cut and fill practices.
         D.   The function of adjacent thoroughfares shall be maintained by
limiting access points to the minimum needed, relating them to existing access
points, the street patterns on surrounding development, the thoroughfare plan
and the intensity of proposed uses.
         E.   Private streets shall not be permitted unless constructed to meet
all current Carlisle engineering standards.
         F.   The design and locations of streets and parking areas shall
comply with the requirements for storm water management set forth in the most
recent Carlisle engineering standards or the latest requirements of the State
of Ohio.
      (9)   Off-Street Parking. The layout of parking areas, service areas, and
related entrances, exits, signs, lighting, noise sources or other potentially

development plan. An application for an amended final development plan shall
follow the review procedures for final development plan review set forth in
subsection (d) hereof. If approved, such amendments to the final development
plan shall supercede the originally approved final development plan.

in order to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
   (a)   To promote the most desirable land use and traffic patterns in
accordance with the objectives of the Carlisle Comprehensive Plan;
   (b)   To provide appropriate and convenient locations of sufficient size for
the exchange of goods and services;

regulating the types of establishments, particularly at the common boundaries,
that would create congestion, noise or other objectionable influences;
   (d)   B-1 Neighborhood Business District. The purpose of the B-
1 Neighborhood Business District is to encourage the establishment of areas for
convenience business uses which tend to meet the daily needs of the residents
of an immediate neighborhood. Such Districts shall be strategically located
with access to a collector street. Marginal strip development is prohibited.
   (e)   B-2 General Business District. The purpose of the B-2 General Business

1270.01 INTENT.
   The Manufacturing Districts include the M-1 Light Manufacturing and M-
2 General Manufacturing. The regulations set forth in this Chapter are
established in order to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
   (a)   To promote the most desirable and beneficial use of the land and
structures in accordance with the objectives of the Carlisle Comprehensive
Plan;
   (b)   To provide appropriate and convenient districts of sufficient size to
carry on research, manufacturing processes, and distribution activities to
serve the community, thereby promoting employment and strengthening the economy
of the community;
   (c)   To improve the manufacturing environment by discouraging unrelated and
incompatible uses in such areas, thereby making land more readily available for
industry;
   (d)   To protect adjacent residential districts by restricting types of
manufacturing uses nearby to only those which will not create objectionable
influences beyond their district boundaries and will be properly buffered and
screened;
   (e)   To protect manufacturing and related development against congestion by
requiring setbacks and limiting the bulk and density of development in relation
to adjacent buildings and available land and by requiring sufficient off-street
parking and loading facilities.
   (f)   To carry out the following specific purposes:
      (1)   To provide an M-1 Light Manufacturing District for office and
industrial uses in areas suitable for such development by reason of location,
topography, soil conditions and the availability of adequate utilities and
transportation systems. The intent is to permit office and other uses such as
limited light industrial and warehouse activities that are office-like in
physical appearance, service requirements, and operational characteristics;
uses that can be carried on wholly within enclosed buildings and subject to
those regulations necessary to reduce congestion and for the protection of
adjacent residential and business activities. This district also permits
accessory retail and service uses to serve as support services for the adjacent
office/industrial uses. The uses allowed are those that because of their
normally unobjectionable characteristics can be operated in relatively close
proximity to residential districts. The M-1 District is designed to encourage
the development of office/light industrial parks/subdivisions by including
reduced standards for lots that are part of a development and which have access
onto a new internal street.
      (2)   To provide an M-2 General Manufacturing District for industrial and
other uses that by virtue of their external effects, noise, glare, fumes,
smoke, dust, odors, truck and/or rail traffic, should be isolated from
residential and commercial uses. These uses perform essential functions for the
Municipality, including employment, and should be provided for in areas that
are best suited for industrial development by reason of location, utilities and
transportation systems. Uses in the M-2 Districts typically generate outdoor
activities and outdoor storage in association with permitted principal uses.
         (Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1270.03 USE REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Uses Permitted by Right. A use listed in Table 1270.03 shall be
permitted by right as a principal use in a district when denoted by the letter
"P" provided that all requirements of other municipal ordinances and this
Zoning Code have been met.
   (b)   Conditional Uses. A use listed in
Table 1270.03 shall be permitted as a conditional use in a district when
denoted by the letter "C", provided the Planning Commission first makes the
determination that the requirements of Chapter
1272 have been met according to the procedures set forth in Chapter
1246.
   (c)   Accessory Uses. A use listed in
Table 1270.03 shall be permitted as an accessory use in a district when denoted
by the letter "A". Such use shall be permitted as a subordinate building or use
when it is clearly incidental to and located on the same lot as the principal
building or use. Accessory uses are further regulated in other sections of this
Zoning Code.

CHAPTER 1272
Conditional Uses
1272.01   Purpose.
1272.03   General criteria for all conditional uses.
1272.05   Specific standards for conditional uses.
1272.07   Schedule of minimum lot and yard dimensions for conditional uses in
residential districts.
1272.09   Schedule of minimum lot and yard dimensions for conditional uses in
commercial districts.
1272.11   Schedule of minimum lot and yard dimensions for conditional uses in
industrial districts.
1272.13   Supplemental regulations for certain conditional uses.
 
1272.01 PURPOSE.
   Conditional uses are a classification of uses that are determined to
generally be compatible in the district in which they are listed as a
conditional use. However, this category of uses is so classified because of the
need to adequately monitor the proposed use in order to ensure that the use and
its operational aspects are truly appropriate in the specific location in which
the use is proposed. Monitoring these uses is necessary because the external
impacts of a particular use are either sufficiently varied or indeterminable in
advance and therefore may vary from site to site; making it possible that -
without the Planning Commission's review - a particular use could be
inappropriate in a certain location within the district.
   These regulations are intended to ensure that conditional uses are reviewed
in a reasonable and equitable manner, while safeguarding the property rights of
all individuals and the health, safety, and general welfare of the community.
Because of this, this Zoning Code must provide more detailed evaluation of each
use listed as a conditional use in a specific district with respect to such
considerations as location, design, size, method(s) of operation, intensity of
use, requirements for public facilities and traffic generation. In considering
a proposed conditional use, the Planning Commission may assign reasonable
requirements to ensure that the proposed development is appropriate in the
location in which it is proposed. Accordingly, conditional use permits shall
conform to the procedures and requirements of Chapter 1246.
(Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1272.03 GENERAL CRITERIA FOR ALL CONDITIONAL USES.
   A conditional use, and uses accessory to such conditional use, shall be
permitted in a district only when specified as a conditional use in such
district and only if such use conforms to the following general criteria, which
are in addition to specific conditions, standards and regulations set forth in
Sections
1272.05 through
1272.11. The Planning Commission shall review the particular facts and
circumstances of each proposed use in terms of the following criteria and shall
find adequate evidence that the use as proposed:
   (a)   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity, and that such use will not essentially
change the character of the same area.
   (b)   Will not be detrimental to property values in the immediate vicinity.
   (c)   Will not restrict or adversely affect the existing use of the adjacent
property owners.
   (d)   Will be designed and constructed so that all access drives, access
points to public streets, driveways, parking and service areas shall be in
compliance with the regulations set forth in Chapter
1284.
   (e)   Will meet the requirements of EPA for stormwater runoff, when
applicable.
   (f)   Will be properly landscaped in accordance with Chapter
1280.
   (g)   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety or general
welfare.
   (h)   The hours of operation of the proposed use are similar to a use
permitted in the district.
   (i)   The establishment of the conditional use in the proposed location will
not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the
surrounding property for uses permitted in the district.
   (j)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary facilities
have been or are being provided.
   (k)   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and
egress designed to minimize traffic congestion on the surrounding public
streets.
   (l)   The establishment of the conditional use should not be detrimental to
the economic welfare of the community by creating excessive additional
requirements at public cost for public facilities such as police, fire and
schools.
(m)   There is minimal potential for future hardship on the conditional use
that could result from the proposed use being surrounded by uses permitted by
right that may be incompatible.
      (Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1272.05 SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USES.
   In addition to the general criteria established in Section
1272.03, the following specific conditions pertaining to each use or group of
uses shall apply.
   (a)   Supplementary Conditions and Safeguards. Nothing in these regulations
shall prohibit the Planning Commission from prescribing supplementary
conditions and safeguards in addition to these requirements in order to ensure
compliance with the criteria set forth in Section
1272.03.
   (b)   Conformance with District Regulations. A conditional use shall conform
to the regulations of the district in which it is located and to other
substantive requirements of this Zoning Code, as well as satisfy the
conditions, standards and requirements of this Chapter. Whenever there is a
difference between the provisions of the conditional use regulations and the
district regulations, the most restrictive provision shall prevail, unless
clearly indicated differently in the regulations.
    (c)   Specific Development Standards.
      (1)   The Planning Commission may limit the hours of operation to ensure
that the conditional use is compatible with the surrounding uses.
      (2)   No lighting shall constitute a nuisance and in no way shall impair
safe movement of traffic on any street or highway. All outside lighting shall
comply with the requirements specified in Chapter
1282.
      (3)   Floodlights, loudspeakers or similar structures shall not be
erected or used in any manner that will cause hazards or annoyance to the
public generally or to the occupants of adjacent property.
      (4)   All trash receptacles shall be adequately screened in compliance
with the regulations set forth in Chapter
1280.
      (5)   Grading and surface drainage provisions shall be prepared by a
registered engineer and reviewed or approved by the Carlisle Engineer.

conditional uses and are in addition to the criteria and standards set forth in

defined in this Section, in proximity to residential, institutional, and non-

uses. It has been demonstrated that adult uses, as defined in this Section,
have been known to cause undesirable secondary effects on residential and
institutional uses, particularly those where children are present, as well as
adjacent non-adult use oriented retail uses. Therefore, in order to prevent
potential deterioration in Carlisle's retail areas; and to avoid potential
adverse impacts on residential and institutional uses particularly those where
children are present, and thereby protecting the public health, safety and
welfare, adult uses, as defined in this Section, shall be conditionally
permitted only in the M-1 and M-2 Industrial Districts subject to the following

persons totally nude, topless, bottomless, or strippers, male or female
impersonators or similar entertainment or services that constitute adult
entertainment or services as defined in this Section.

that meets any of the following tests:
            1.   The establishment offers for sale items from any two (2) of
the following categories: (a) adult media; (b) lingerie, or (c) leather goods
marketed or presented in a context to suggest their use for sadomasochistic
practices; and the combination of such items constitutes more than ten percent
(10%) of its stock in trade or occupies more than ten percent (10%) of its
floor area.
            2.   More than five percent (5%) of its stock-in-trade consists of
sexually oriented toys or novelties.

shall a family home be closer than 600 feet from where another family home or
group home for handicapped persons is located.
      (8)   Evidence shall be presented that the proposed facility meets the

home for handicapped persons is located.

care home, whether certified or not certified by the county director of human
services, shall be considered to be a residential use of property for purposes
of municipal zoning and shall be a permitted use in all zoning districts in
which residential uses are permitted. A type "B" family day-care home is a
permanent residence of the provider where childcare is provided for one (1) to

accessory use in residential districts, and do not require a zoning
certificate.
(Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1274.11 HOME OCCUPATIONS.
   The purpose of this section is to set forth regulations, which control the
establishment and operation of home occupations. The intent of these
regulations is to control the nonresidential use of a residential dwelling unit
so that the nonresidential use is limited to an accessory use, and shall not in
any way adversely affect the uses permitted in the residential district of
which they are a part. Compliance with these regulations should result in all
home occupations being located and conducted in such a manner that their
existence is not detectable in any manner from the outside of the dwelling
unit.
   (a)   Home occupations shall be permitted in residential districts provided:
      (1)   Only members of the family residing within the dwelling shall be
engaged in such occupation at that location and not more than one part-time
non-family member (limited to twenty (20) hours in any week) or occasional
clerical or bookkeeping assistant who may perform services incidental to such
occupation;
      (2)   The occupation is conducted wholly within the principal building
and the space used for production and sale does not occupy more than twenty-
five percent (25%) of the net floor area of the dwelling unit;
      (3)   No retail or wholesale goods except that which are produced or
processed on the premises shall be exchanged on the property;
      (4)   No equipment shall be used which will create any dust, noise,
odors, glare, vibrations or electrical disturbances beyond the lot;
      (5)   The home occupation shall be confined to the principal building on
the lot or premises, and no structure shall be constructed, reconstructed or
altered to permit extension of the home occupation outside of the principal
building;
      (6)   All storage of materials, goods, supplies or equipment related to
the operation of a home occupation shall be inside the structure;
      (7)   The residential character of the dwelling exterior shall not be
changed, except that a small, non-illuminated sign of maximum size of two (2)
square feet may be permitted;
      (8)   Traffic shall not be generated by such home occupation in
significantly greater volume than would normally be expected in the residential
neighborhood; and
      (9)   Any need for parking generated by the conduct of such home
occupation shall be met on or adjacent to the driveway, but shall not be
permitted in a required front setback, or in the public right-of-way.
   (b)   A home occupation shall be permitted only after a zoning certificate
has been issued by the Planning and Zoning Administrator. Those uses which are
questionable shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission to assure that they
are in character with this section and will not constitute an objectionable use
of the residentially zoned property due to potential noise, increased
pedestrian and vehicular traffic, or any other conditions that might interfere
with the general welfare of the surrounding residential area.
   (c)   When any home occupation results in an undesirable condition
interfering with the general welfare of the surrounding residential area, such
home occupation may be terminated by the Planning and Zoning Administrator.
Such termination may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals. An undesirable
condition may be identified as abnormal traffic, objectionable noise or any
other condition not conducive to a residential neighborhood situation.
      (Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)

these regulations. Architectural features include any construction attending
to, but not an integral part of the sign, and which may consist of landscape or
building or structural forms that enhance the site in general.
   (d)   The following signs and displays are exempt from the regulations of
this Chapter:
      (1)   Public Signs. Any sign displaying a public notice or warning
required by a valid and applicable federal, state, or local law, ordinance, or

proposed sign(s) does not serve instructional purposes, it shall be considered
a freestanding or wall sign, as applicable, and subject to the pertinent
regulations in this Chapter.
            (Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1286.05 COMPUTATIONS AND RULES OF MEASUREMENT.
   The following regulations shall control the computation and measurement of
sign area, sign height, window area and building frontage:
   (a)   Determining Sign Area or Dimension.
      (1)   Sign area shall include the face of all the display area of the
sign. Sign area shall not include the frame and structural support unless such
structural support is determined to constitute an integral part of the sign
design.
      (2)   For a sign that is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise prepared
and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area of the sign
shall be the area of one (1) rectangular shape that encompasses the entire
background or frame.
      (3)   For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures or elements on
a wall or similar surface of a building or structure, or an irregular shaped
freestanding sign, the area of the sign shall be the area of one (1)
rectangular shape that encompasses the perimeter of all the elements in the
display.
      (4)   For freestanding signs and projecting signs:
         A.   The sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one (1) of
the faces when two (2) identical display faces are joined, are parallel, or
within thirty (30) degrees of being parallel to each other and are at no point
separated by a distance that exceeds two (2) feet apart.
         B.   No more than two (2) display faces shall be permitted.
         C.   The portion of a solid sign base that is mostly screened by
landscaping, up to a maximum height of two (2) feet, shall not be calculated as
sign area.
   (b)   Determining Sign Height. The height of a sign shall be measured from
the average natural grade at the base of the sign or support structure to the
tallest element of the calculated sign area. A freestanding sign on a man-made
base, including a graded earth mound, shall be measured from the average site
grade prior to the addition of the sign.
   (c)   Determining Building Frontage and Building Unit. For the purposes of
these sign regulations, the length of the building wall that faces a public
street, that faces a public parking lot, or that contains a public entrance to
the uses therein shall be considered the building frontage. See subsection (c)
(5) and (6) below.
      (1)   Each building frontage shall be entitled to the sign area permitted
in this Chapter.
      (2)   The building frontage shall be measured along such building wall
between the exterior faces of the exterior side walls.
      (3)   In the case of an irregular wall surface, a single straight line
extended along such wall surface shall be used to measure the length.
      (4)   For multi-occupant buildings, the portion of a building that is
owned or leased by a single occupant shall be considered a building unit. The
building frontage for a building unit shall be measured from the centerline of
the party walls defining the building unit.
      (5)   The primary frontage shall be the portion of a frontage that serves
as the main access point to a building or building unit. A site/building will
be considered to have secondary frontage when any of the following site/
building characteristics are present:
         A.   The subject site is a corner lot;
         B.   The primary parking area is not located adjacent to a public
street; and,
         C.   The building or unit has walls with ingress and egress that do
not face the public street.
      (6)   When a site has primary and secondary frontage as defined in
subsection (c)(5) hereof, the property owner shall determine which wall shall
be the primary building frontage and which wall(s) shall be the secondary
building frontage. Only one (1) outside wall of any business shall be
considered its primary frontage.
   (d)   Determining Window Area. The window area of a building shall be the
total glass area of windows on the building frontage. For the purposes of
determining window area for ground floor occupants, the ground floor shall be
considered to be no more than fifteen (15) feet in height above grade.

1286.13 DYNAMIC DISPLAYS AND CHANGEABLE COPY SIGNS.
   The intent of this section is to set forth regulations specific to signs in
which the copy (lettering) is not permanent but rather can be changed either by
use of electronics or by manually changing the text. Below is a description of
each method and specific regulations pertaining to them.
   (a)   Changeable Copy Signs (Manual Devices). For the sole purpose of
permitting areas for changeable copy, the size of a permanent freestanding
sign, otherwise permitted by these regulations, may be increased in area an
additional twenty (20) square feet provided that the maximum height from the
ground to the top of the sign shall not exceed eight (8) feet.
      (1)   For the purpose of these regulations a changeable copy sign is a
sign, or any portion thereof, where the message or graphics are not permanently
affixed to the structure, framing, or background and may be periodically
replaced, or covered over manually. The changeable copy portion of a sign shall
comply with all other regulations of this Code including the design standards
of Section
1286.15.
      (2)   When reviewing the proposed sign, the Planning Commission shall
consider and establish the standards applicable for the changeable copy which
may include, but are not limited to: determining the portion of the sign
permitted for changeable copy; determining the suitable material and method for
making changes and the manner for fastening the new copy; and establishing the
color and design criteria. These standards shall be set forth in the sign
permit and shall apply for the life of the sign unless otherwise amended by the
Planning Commission pursuant to the administrative procedures of Section
1286.21.
   (b)   Dynamic Displays (Electronic Message Centers). Dynamic displays are
defined in Chapter
1242 of the Code. Specific regulations of these signs are enumerated below.
      (1)   Dynamic displays are allowed only on monument/free-standing signs
in commercial and industrial districts. Dynamic displays located in commercial/
industrial districts but that are located within 100 feet of a residential
zoning district must adhere to additional requirements set forth in subsection
(b)(9) hereof. The required setback for a dynamic display shall comply with
Section
1286.07(b) of the Code
      (2)   Dynamic displays may occupy no more than thirty percent (30%) of
the actual copy and graphic area. The remainder of the sign must not have the
capability to have dynamic displays even if not used. Only one (1), contiguous
dynamic display area is allowed on a sign face and only one (1) sign per
property is permitted;
      (3)   A dynamic display may not change or move more often than once every
twenty (20) seconds, except one for which changes are necessary to correct
hour-and-minute, date, or temperature information. Time, date, or temperature
information is considered one dynamic display and may not be included as a
component of any other dynamic display. The time, date, or temperature
information itself may change no more often than once every three (3) seconds;
      (4)   The images and messages displayed must be static, and the
transition from one static display to another must be instantaneous without any
special effects;
      (5)   The images and messages displayed must be complete in themselves,
without continuation in content to the next image or message or to any other
sign;
      (6)   Every line of copy and graphics in a dynamic display must be at
least seven (7) inches in height on a road with a speed limit of twenty-five
(25) to thirty-four (34) miles per hour, nine (9) inches on a road with a speed
limit of thirty-five (35) to forty-four (44) miles per hour, twelve (12) inches
on a road with a speed limit of forty-five (45) to fifty-four (54) miles per
hour, and fifteen (15) inches on a road with a speed limit of fifty-five (55)
miles per hour or more. If there is insufficient room for copy and graphics of
this size in the area allowed under subsection (b)(1) hereof, then no dynamic
display is allowed;
      (7)   Dynamic displays must be designed and equipped to freeze the device
in one position if a malfunction occurs. The displays must also be equipped
with a means to immediately discontinue the display if it malfunctions, and the
sign owner must immediately stop the dynamic display when notified by the
Municipality that it is not complying with the standards of this chapter;
      (8)   Dynamic displays must comply with the following brightness
standards:
         A.   Dynamic displays must be designed to automatically adjust the
brightness levels of the sign in response to ambient conditions. This
requirement ensures the readability and brightness levels of the sign during
the day and night.
         B.   Lighting levels shall not exceed one foot-candle at the property
line of the site utilizing the dynamic display.
         C.   Mitigative measures shall be employed to limit glare and spill
light to protect neighboring parcels and to maintain traffic safety on public
roads.
         D.   No sign may be brighter than is necessary for clear and adequate
visibility.
         E.   No sign may be of such intensity or brilliance as to impair the
vision of a motor vehicle driver with average eyesight or to otherwise
interfere with the driver's operation of a motor vehicle.
         F.   No sign may be of such intensity or brilliance that it interferes
with the effectiveness of an official traffic sign, device or signal.
         G.   The Municipality may require submission of a light distribution
plan if deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the intent of this chapter.
      (9)   Dynamic displays located within 100 feet of a residentially zoned
district shall be located away from said district and the lighting levels from
the display can not exceed 0.5 foot-candles at the property line of the site
utilizing the dynamic display.
         A.   The sign shall be designed with sufficient landscaping so as to
properly screen it from the residential district.
         B.   The sign shall be located on the site in the best possible manner
to avoid any visual obstruction to the neighboring residential properties.
   (c)   Review Authority. Both changeable copy signs and dynamic displays are
subject to the review and approval of the Planning Commission. Any person not
satisfied by the action of the Planning Commission can appeal to the Board of
Zoning Appeals for a variance.
      (Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1286.15 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   In addition to ensuring compliance with the numerical standards of these
regulations, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall consider the proposed
general design arrangement and placement of the sign according to the following
criteria:
   (a)   The lettering shall be large enough to be easily read but not overly
large or out of scale with the building or site.
   (b)   The sign should be consolidated into a minimum number of elements.
   (c)   The ratio between the message and the background shall permit easy
recognition of the message.
   (d)   The size, style, and location of the sign shall be appropriate to the
activity of the site.
   (e)   The sign shall complement the building and adjacent buildings by being
designed and placed to enhance the architecture of the building.
   (f)   Signs shall be designed with a limited number of, and harmonious use
of, colors.
   (g)   Signs, if seen in series, shall have a continuity of design with the
style of sign generally consistent throughout the building or block.
   (h)   Instructional signs shall contain the minimum information and the
minimum area necessary to convey the message and instruct the viewer in the
safe and efficient use of the facility.
   (i)   Sign Concept Plan. For multi-tenant buildings and development projects
with multiple buildings in the B-1, B-2, B-3, M-1, and M-2 Districts, the
Planning Commission shall approve basic sign parameters that set forth the
location, size, color, and style of each tenant sign. Such sign parameters will
be established when the Planning Commission reviews development plans for new
buildings. Whenever the Planning Commission has approved such sign parameters,
the Planning and Zoning Administrator will ensure any subsequent sign
application submitted for a tenant of the development or building complies with
such sign parameters.
      (Ord. 8-13. Passed 5-14-13.)
1286.17 SIGN ILLUMINATION, CONSTRUCTION, AND MAINTENANCE STANDARDS.

1422.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.

be made or a change of occupancy occurs during the restoration of the
structure, such repairs, alterations, additions or change of occupancy shall
comply with Chapters 1 and 34 of the Ohio Building Code and this chapter.
(OBC 109)
1422.08 CONFLICT.
   (a)   General. Where, in any specific case, different sections of the Ohio
Building Code specify different materials, methods of construction or other
requirements, the most restrictive shall govern. Where there is a conflict
between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific
requirement shall be applicable.
   (b)   Other Laws. The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall not be
deemed to nullify any provisions of state or federal law. The Municipality may
make further and additional regulations, not in conflict with Ohio R.C.
Chapters 3781 and 3791 or with the rules of the Board of Building Standards.
However approval by the Board of Building Standards of any fixture, device,
material, system, assembly or product of a manufacturing process, or method or
manner of construction or installation shall constitute approval for their use
anywhere in Ohio.
   (c)   Other Rules. As provided in division (B) of Ohio R.C. 3781.11, the
rules of the Board of Building Standards shall supersede and govern any order,
standard or rule of the Divisions of State Fire Marshal or Industrial
Compliance in the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Health and of
counties and townships, in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are
in conflict with the rules of the Board of Building Standards, except that
rules adopted and orders issued by the Fire Marshal pursuant to Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3743 prevail in the event of a conflict.
   There may be other requirements owners may be required to meet as set forth
by other licensing agencies such as the Ohio State Fire Marshal, Ohio
Department of Health, the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services, Ohio
Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, Ohio Department of
Developmental Disabilities, federal agencies, or other licensing authorities.
Owners and designers should investigate these additional licensing agency
requirements to ensure they are incorporated into the building design before
submitting to the certified building department for plan approval.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3781.10 shall govern any rule or standard adopted by the Board pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 4104.02 and 4105.011.

professional, courteous, impartial, responsive, and cooperative manner. The
Building Official shall render interpretations of this Code and to adopt
policies and procedures in order to clarify the application of its provisions.
Such interpretations, policies and procedures shall be in compliance with the
intent and purpose of this Code. Building Officials shall be responsible to
assure that a system is in place to track and audit all projects, to assure
that all Building Department personnel perform their duties in accordance with
this section, and for the overall administration of a Building Department as
follows:
   (b)   Applications and Plan Approvals. The Building Official shall receive
applications, require or cause the submitted construction documents to be
examined, ascertain by such examinations whether the construction indicated and
described is in accordance with the requirements of this Ohio Building Code,
and shall issue plan approvals for the construction, erection, alteration,
demolition and moving of buildings and structures. The Building Official shall
require a master plans examiner or elective plans examiners to examine the
construction documents to verify the construction indicated is in accordance
with the requirements of this Code and shall assure coordination of plan
review.
   (c)   Plan Examination by the Building Official. When the Building
Department does not have in its full-time employ a certified master plans
examiner, the certified Building Official shall examine construction documents
to determine compliance with the rules of the Board if the registered design
professional elects to submit construction documents that contain a written
certification by the registered design professional indicating conformance with
the requirements of the rules of the Board and Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and
3791.
   (d)   Orders. The Building Official shall issue all orders in accordance

1440.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Council of
Carlisle, State of Ohio, does ordain the following regulations.
(Ord. 21-10. Passed 10-12-10.)
1440.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Municipality of Carlisle has special flood hazard areas that are subject
to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
(Ord. 21-10. Passed 10-12-10.)
1440.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood- blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood- prone areas:
      (1)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (2)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (3)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (4)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
         (Ord. 21-10. Passed 10-12-10.)
1440.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
      (Ord. 21-10. Passed 10-12-10.)
1440.05 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Carlisle identified in Section
1440.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
Municipality of Carlisle.
(Ord. 21-10. Passed 10-12-10.)
1440.06 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (a)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Warren County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Warren County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective December 20, 2019.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100 year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Municipality as required by Section
1440.24(c).
   (b)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the City Hall at 760 West Central Avenue,
Carlisle, Ohio 45005.
(Ord. 21-10. Passed 10-12-10; Ord. 22-19. Passed 10-22-19.)
1440.07 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction, covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 21-10. Passed 10-12-10.)
1440.08 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
      (Ord. 21-10. Passed 10-12-10.)
1440.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the Municipality, any officer or
employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 21-10. Passed 10-12-10.)
1440.10 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 21-10. Passed 10-12-10.)
1440.11 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   "Accessory structure" means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   "Appeal" means request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   "Base flood" means a flood having a one percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to
as the 1% chance annual flood or 100-year flood.
   (d)   "Base (100 year) flood elevation (BFE) " means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in feet mean sea level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from one to three feet).
   (e)   "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   "Development" means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   "Enclosure below the lowest floor." See "lowest floor" as defined in
this section.
   (h)   "Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)." Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no Federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   "Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)" means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   "Fill" means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   "Flood or flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial
or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   "Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM)" means usually the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
   (m)   "Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) " means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   "Flood insurance risk zones" means zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100 year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100 year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (o)   "Flood insurance study (FIS)" means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on flood boundary and floodway maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   "Flood protection elevation (FPE)" is the base flood elevation plus
one foot of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   "Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   "Historic structure" means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   "Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis" means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   "Letter of map change (LOMC)" is an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary
and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of map amendment (LOMA) means a revision based on technical
data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special
flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map
and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood
hazard area.
      (2)   Letter of map revision (LOMR) means a revision based on technical
data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) means a formal review
and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, or flood insurance studies.
   (v)   "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a recreational vehicle. For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   "Manufactured home park" as specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27 01, a "manufactured home park" means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)"means the Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.

authority.
      (Ord. 21-10. Passed 10-12-10.)
1440.22 DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
Federal, State, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When preliminary flood insurance rate maps and/or flood insurance
study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Section
1440.27.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
      (Ord. 21-10. Passed 10-12-10.)
1440.23 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
Federal, State, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or,
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible; and
         B.   Paragraph (a)(2), items A. and C. through E. hereof.
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Municipality specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1440.21(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
         (Ord. 21-10. Passed 10-12-10.)
1440.27 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby appointed to serve as the
Appeals Board for these regulations as established by Municipal Code.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in City Hall
at 760 West Central Avenue, Carlisle, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with this section.
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within ten days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         F.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in paragraphs (d)(2)A. to K. hereof
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
      (5)   Procedure at Hearings.
         A.   All testimony shall be given under oath.
         B.   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
         C.   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and
testimony in support of the appeal or variance.
         D.   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
         E.   All witnesses shall be subject to cross examination by the
adverse party or their counsel.
         F.   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
         G.   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
         H.   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
      (6)   Appeal to the court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Warren County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
         (Ord. 21-10. Passed 10-12-10.)

without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in
1440.20.
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
subsection (c) hereof.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with subsection (c) hereof.

1454.03 INTENT AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The intent of this chapter is to protect the land and water resources
of the City by establishing standards to achieve a level of soil erosion and
storm water control that will minimize and abate degradation of land and water
resources and damage to public and private property resulting from earth
disturbing activities. In addition this regulation further intends to:
      (1)   Assure that those involved in earth-disturbing activities minimize
both soil erosion and the volume and rate of storm water runoff from their
sites;
      (2)   Preserve to the extent practicable the natural drainage
characteristics of the site and minimize the need to construct, repair, and
replace enclosed, subsurface storm drain systems;
      (3)   Assure that stormwater controls are incorporated into site planning
and design at the earliest possible stage and that all stormwater management
practices are properly designed, constructed, and maintained;
      (4)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil and to
promptly re-vegetate and stabilize the site following earth disturbing
activities;
      (5)   Reduce the need for costly maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments, ditches, water resources, and wetlands, through the design and use
of stormwater management practices;
      (6)   Encourage the construction of storm water management practices that
serve multiple purposes such as flood control, erosion control, fire
protection, water quality protection, recreation, and habitat preservation; and
      (7)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural infiltration and
groundwater recharge.
   (b)   Any person or persons proposing to develop or redevelop land within
the City for any of the uses listed in subsection (c) hereof shall design,
develop, and submit a site development plan (SDP) as described in Section
1454.06. Said plan will be evaluated to determine the potential for erosion,
runoff and sedimentation impacts that may result from such development
activities and the need for submission of a stormwater management plan (SMP)
described in Section
1454.07, Appendix A, Earth Disturbing Activity Performance Standards and
Appendix B, Stormwater Management Plan (SMP) Requirements, a ttached to

all disturbed areas stabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed;
and
      (2)   Where a watercourse will be crossed regularly during construction,
a temporary stream crossing shall be provided by using clean materials meeting
the requirements of the City Engineer and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
used for the shortest period practical, removed following site construction,
and restored as described in subsection (j)(1) above.
   (k)   Maintenance and Removal of Temporary Measures.
      (1)   All temporary erosion and sediment control practices shall be
maintained and repaired to assure continued performance; and
      (2)   All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be
removed within thirty days after final site stabilization is achieved or after
the temporary measures are no longer needed. Trapped sediment and other
disturbed soil areas resulting from the removal of temporary measures shall
have the final grade re-established and be permanently stabilized to prevent
further erosion and sedimentation.
   (l)   Maintenance of Permanent Measures. All permanent erosion and sediment
control practices shall be maintained and repaired to ensure continual
performance, inspected to ensure proper installation and long term
functionality. If a defect is found, the control measure shall be repaired or
replaced as deemed by City officials and/or its authorized agent(s) within
seven days after final site stabilization is achieved.

after any storm event greater than three-quarters of an inch (0.75") of rain
per twenty-four hour period. The site owner and/or applicant shall assign
certified inspection personnel experienced in the installation and maintenance
of erosion and runoff controls to conduct these inspections to ensure that all
stormwater control practices are functional, that all provisions of the SMP and
this regulation are being met, and whether additional control measures are
required.

maintain for three years following the final stabilization of the site and
final inspection conducted by a City official or its authorized agent(s), a
record summarizing inspections, names(s) and qualifications of personnel making
the inspections, the date(s) of inspections, major observations relating to the
implementation of the SMP and a certification as to whether the site is in
compliance with the SMP and identify any incidents of non-compliance . A copy
of these records shall be provided to the City on a quarterly basis.
      (3)   If the City deems, via inspections, that all storm water control
practices are not functional, the site owner/developer may be required to
install additional erosion and runoff controls, assign other inspection

the width of any section of berm constructed in fill, plus ten feet on each
side of the structure; and
         D.    Where an underground type of detention, retention and/or
infiltration system is used, the easement minimum width shall be determined by
the total of the outside to outside width of the structure, plus three feet,
plus one foot of width for every one foot of depth from the bottom of the
structure;
      (3)   Unless otherwise required by the authorized agent(s), stormwater
management facilities, including basins, ponds or other retention/detention/
infiltration practices, shall be on separate lots held and maintained by an

residential and nonresidential structures and all existing premises and
constitute minimum requirements and standards for premises, structures,
equipment and facilities for light, ventilation, space, heating, sanitation,
protection from the elements, life safety, safety from fire and other hazards,
and for safe and sanitary maintenance; the responsibility of owners, operators
and occupants, and for administration, enforcement and penalties.
   (c)   Intent. This code shall be construed to secure its expressed intent,
which is to ensure public health, safety and welfare, conserve and protect the
value of premises, to protect and improve aesthetic aspects of premises and to
protect against and elimination of nuisances, insofar as they are affected by
the continued occupancy and maintenance of structures and premises. Existing
structures and premises that do not comply with these provisions shall be
altered or repaired to provide a minimum level of health and safety as required
herein.
   (d)   Severability.  If a section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of
this code is, for any reason, held to be unconstitutional, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this code.
(Ord. 31-07. Passed 10-23-07.)
1466.02 APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   General. The provisions of this code shall apply to all matters
affecting or relating to structures and premises, as set forth in
1466.01. Where, in a specific case, different sections of this code specify
different requirements, the most restrictive shall govern.
   (b)   Maintenance. Equipment, systems, devices and safeguards required by
this code or a previous regulation or code under which the structure or
premises was constructed, altered or repaired shall be maintained in good
working order. No owner, operator or occupant shall cause any service,
facility, equipment or utility which is required under this chapter to be
removed from or shut off from or discontinued for any occupied dwelling, except
for such temporary interruption as necessary while repairs or alterations are
in progress. The requirements of this code are not intended to provide the
basis for removal or abrogation of fire protection and safety systems and
devices in existing structures. Except as otherwise specified herein, the owner
or the owner's designated agent shall be responsible for the maintenance of
buildings, structures and premises.
   (c)   Application of Other Codes. Repairs, additions or alterations to a
structure, or changes of occupancy, shall be done in accordance with the
procedures and provisions of Ohio Building Code, Ohio Revised Code, Residential

with the manufacturer's installation instructions.
   (f)   Historic Buildings. The provisions of this code may not be mandatory
for existing buildings or structures that have been designated by the State of

owner of the building or structure by the enforcement of these provisions would
unduly outweigh the Municipality's interest in the health, safety or welfare of
the public.
   (g)   Referenced Codes and Standards. The codes and standards referenced in
this code shall be those that are listed in Chapter 8 of the International
Property Maintenance Code and considered part of the requirements of this code

premises or equipment is found to be dangerous to the life, health, property or
safety of the public or the occupants of the structure by not providing minimum
safeguards to protect or warn occupants in the event of fire, or because such
structure contains unsafe equipment or is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated,
structurally unsafe or of such faulty construction or unstable foundation, that
partial or complete collapse is possible.
      (2)   Unsafe equipment. “Unsafe equipment” includes any boiler, heating
equipment, elevator, moving stairway, electrical wiring or device, flammable

removes a condemnation placard without the approval of the Code Official shall

equipment, shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor and the violation shall be
deemed a strict liability offense. The penalty shall be one hundred fifty

vehicle, and as such constitutes an imminent health, safety, fire or traffic
hazard, be kept or located on any premises. One inoperable vehicle may be kept

to vehicle parts used in the repair process, and the process has a reasonable
end time, and claim of being under repair is not a subterfuge for having junk
vehicles or miscellaneous repair parts exposed to the public, thus presenting a
public nuisance.
         B.   The inoperable vehicle being offered for sale is properly titled
in the State of Ohio and is being offered for a sale at a fair market value as
a vehicle, and not as a subterfuge, so that the vehicle can be used for a non-
designed use, such as, but not limited to, a structure for storing items, a
structure for displaying a sign or banner, or a structure for use as a housing
or a business office.
         C.   Junkyards operated and maintained in compliance with applicable
Municipal ordinances.

or effectively screened from view in a manner subject to the approval of the
Planning Commission. The storage of such functional items as children's play
structures, firewood and operable automobiles and vehicles shall be exempt from
this requirement. If the principal building on any premises has become vacant,
portable objects shall not be stored outside on the lot, but instead shall be
placed within an enclosed structure.
   (l)   Diseased and Dead Trees. Diseased trees are those with any form of
decay or vegetation sickness that can be transmitted to other trees and those
infected with insects to such an extent as to create a nuisance adversely
affecting nearby persons or property. Such trees shall be removed immediately
or shall be treated or sprayed to eliminate, at once, the risk of the decay or
vegetation sickness being transmitted to other trees, and to remove the insect
nuisance situation. The Code Official shall determine if a dead tree
constitutes a safety hazard because of its proximity to the right-of-way, any
building or structure, or persons who use nearby premises. If the Code Official
decides that a tree constitutes such a safety hazard, it shall be removed at
the expense of the owner or operator responsible for maintenance of the
premises on which it is located.
   (m)   Casualty Damage Repair.  
      (1)   Within 30 days after casualty damage to any structure or exterior
property, the owner shall have taken the following steps:
         A.   Contracted for repair and restoration of damaged areas and
removal of debris; and/or
         B.   Contracted for the demolition (as regulated by the Building Code
of this Municipality) and removal of any portions of the premises not to be
repaired and restored, and also for removal of debris in connection therewith;
and
         C.   Arranged for the contract work to be completed within 60 days
from the contract date, accepting delay caused by weather, strikes, acts of God
or other matters beyond the reasonable control of the owner and contractor.
      (2)   The Code Official may extend these time periods to the extent he or
she deems appropriate, but shall not be required to do so. Time is of the
essence in repairing damage quickly so as to avoid detrimental impact upon
persons and property.
