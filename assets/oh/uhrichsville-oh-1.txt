   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended. (ORC 1.58)
101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof. (ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included. (ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances. (ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation. (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended. (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable. (ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

         (Ord. 24-99. Passed 10-14-99.)
133.02 PURCHASING POLICY.
   (a)   Purchase Order.  
      (1)   Ohio R.C. 5705.41 states that no contract or orders involving the
expenditure of money may be made unless the fiscal officer has certified that
“the amount required to meet the obligation has been lawfully appropriated for
such purpose and is in the treasury or in the process of collection to the
credit of an appropriate fund free from any previous encumbrances.” The vehicle
to present this certification is the purchase order.
      (2)   Any contract made without this certification shall be void and no
warrant shall be issued in payment. The only exception to this comes under the
provisions of a “then and now” certificate. Basically this provision allows for
the legislative body to approve a purchase order after the goods or services
have been purchased if two conditions have been met:
         A.   There were appropriations to cover the payment at the time the
contract or order was placed, and
         B.   Currently there are appropriations to cover the payment. If the
order is for one thousand dollars ($1,000) or less, the fiscal officer may
authorize the expenditure.
      Otherwise, the legislative body must authorize the expenditure.
      (3)   The process of using purchase orders not only facilitates the
ordering of the merchandise or services, it is also a part of the budgetary
process. The amount of each purchase order shall be posted to the proper
appropriation ledger pages(s). This is known as “encumbering” or “setting
aside” a portion of the appropriation. The fiscal officer’s certificate appears
on the bottom of the purchase order. This states that the funds are available
and/or in the process of collection. This means that the legislative body has
appropriations and the cash to pay for this purchase or the money is estimated
to be collected. This posting of the purchase order reduces the amount of
available appropriations. When an appropriation account reflects zero, no
purchase orders should be entered into until the taxing authority increases
that account’s appropriation.
      (4)   Each purchase order should provide the following information:
         A.   Purchase order number (consecutively numbered)
         B.   Requisition number (if applicable)
         C.   Date.
         D.   Name of local government.
         E.   Name of vendor.
         F.   Account code.
         G.   Quantity, unit description, price per unit, and amount.
         H.   Name and title of person authorizing purchase order.
         I.   Destination.
         J.   Method of shipment.
         K.   Fiscal officer’s certification.
      (5)   There are two types of purchase orders, regular and blanket, as
described below.
   (b)   Regular Purchase Order. A regular purchase order is issued when a
purchase order of specific items is planned. A regular purchase order is done
to issue orders for payment, and make contracts or obligations calling for or
requiring the payment of money made for specified permitted purposes from a
specific line item appropriation account in a specified fund for a sum of money
exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) upon that certification by the fiscal
officer that this sum of money has been lawfully appropriated, authorized, or
directed for a permitted purpose and is in the treasury or in the process of
collection. These purchase orders are usually for specific expenditures that
are recurring and are reasonably predictable operating expenses for the current
year. More than one such purchase order may be outstanding at any time. An
example of such a purchase would be the entity’s telephone expense for the
year. If a purchase order is issued at the beginning of the year for the
current telephone expense, then the certificate of availability of funds would
set aside the amount from the appropriate appropriations at that time for this
specific expense.
   (c)   Blanket Purchase Order. A blanket purchase order is used to purchase a
variety of items over a period of time. The maximum length of time a blanket
purchase order can be outstanding is three months or until the end of the
fiscal year, whichever comes first. The maximum amount of the blanket purchase
order is five thousand dollars ($5,000) per appropriation account. Blanket
purchase orders can be issued to a variety of vendors or a specific vendor. A
blanket purchase can be issued for up to three months for a specified amount
under five thousand dollars ($5,000). The purchase order would be encumbered
against the appropriate account. The dollar amount should be based on an
estimate of what will be needed. If the purchase order is depleted before the
time element has expired, a new blanket purchase order may be issued. A blanket
purchase order should be labeled as such and state the effective dates and
maximum dollar amount.
   (d)   Order and Recording the Purchase.  
      (1)   The purchase order, once given to a vendor, not only constitutes an
order to pay: it is a record to compare to an actual shipment of materials and
a document which, when accompanied by an invoice from the vendor, will
authorize the fiscal officer to prepare a voucher for the purchase.
      (2)   Once a purchase order is approved and signed by the appropriate
officials, the following copies will be distributed.
         A.   The original copy is mailed or hand-carried to the vendor.
         B.   The second copy is filed in an “Open Purchase Order” file in the
fiscal officer’s office.
         C.   The third copy, used as a “receiving” copy, is given to the
department user for his or her use in comparing the purchase order with the
actual materials or services.
      (3)   Upon receiving the actual materials or services ordered by the
purchase order, the requesting department will check the shipment against the
receiving copy of the purchase order and inform the fiscal officer:
         A.   If the shipment is complete, the requestor will indicate such on
the receiving copy of the purchase order and forward that copy to the Fiscal
Officer.
         B.   If the shipment is only partial, the department will indicate on
the receiving copy those items received and mark the copy as a partial
shipment. The copy may then be forwarded to the fiscal officer to authorize
partial payment; however, the original must be returned to the requesting
department for subsequent documentation of receipt of final shipment.
      (4)   Upon receipt of the receiving copy of the purchase from the
requesting department, the fiscal officer will match the receiving copy with
its corresponding in the open purchases order file. These copies are then
refiled until receipt of the vendor’s invoice.
   (e)   Payment of Invoices.
      (1)   When an invoice is received by the fiscal officer for goods or
services, the fiscal officer will compare the copies of the purchase order with
the invoice. No invoice will be paid without a corresponding purchase order
confirming receipt of the goods or services. No vendor will be paid from a
periodic “statement” nor from a duplicate invoice to assure that the proper
amount is paid and no duplicate payments are made.
      (2)   When the fiscal officer has matched the invoice to a purchase
order, he or she will compare the amount of the invoice with the amount of the
purchase order. If the invoice billing is greater than the purchase order
authorization and the purchase order amount was derived from a firm quote by
the vendor, the fiscal officer must consult the vendor to determine the reason
for the difference and have the legislative authority approve the difference
before a voucher is written.
      (3)   The fiscal officer will create a voucher to be attached to the
receiving copy of the purchase order, the invoice, bill of lading, etc., with
the expenditure posting detail written on it. Until payment, this voucher will
be filed in an “Open Voucher” file.
      (4)   If the voucher is over one thousand dollars ($1,000) the fiscal
officer must forward the voucher and attached documents to the legislative
authority for approval. The fiscal officer will present the voucher to the
legislative authority for approval, in a public meeting on the 2nd and 4th
Thursday of each month. If an emergency situation arises and approval is needed
before a public meeting, a special session of Council can be called.
      (5)   After approval from the legislative authority the fiscal officer
will record each in the disbursement journal and the appropriations ledger. The
following information will be recorded on both the journal and the ledger.
         A.   The date the check was issued.
         B.   The payee’s name.
         C.   The original purchase order number.
         D.   The amount of the check.
         E.   The amount of that check will also be recorded in the proper
fund’s column portion of the cash journal, which is used to record each fund’s
cash balance.
      (6)   In addition, indication that the check has been written should be
made to the original purchase order entry on the purchase order register by
writing the check number on that entry.
      (7)   Once the check has been recorded and sent, the receiving copy of
the purchase order is to be attached to the voucher and filed by the check
number. The “Open Purchase Order” file copy of the purchase order is filed in a
“Closed Purchase Order” file, by the purchase order number.
   (f)   Purchase of Continuing or Contractual Services.
      (1)   A separate purchase order for contractual services will be
initiated at the time a contract is entered into by the City. The purchase
order will show the title and date of that contract and the amount appropriated
for that contract during the fiscal year. If the contract carries beyond any
fiscal year, a new purchase order should be initiated for the new fiscal year.
All payments for invoices under the contract will then be associated with this
purchase order number.
      (2)   Each month, upon receiving a bill and confirming the existence of
adequate cash and unencumbered funds, the fiscal officer will prepare a voucher
for the amount of the bill for these contractual services.
   (g)   Purchase of Capital Assets. When a purchase order is initiated for the
purchase of capital assets out of the permanent improvement fund, City Council
must first approve the purchase of all capital assets prior to purchase, even
though there may be appropriations to cover the purchase. This allows Council
to be aware of purchases made by the City.
   (h)   Emergency Situations. When an emergency situation arises, that could
be life threatening to the citizens of Uhrichsville, the Mayor at his
discretion can enter into a contract or agreement to stabilize the situation.
   (i)   Responsibilities. All employees, elected officials, and appointed
officials of the City are required to follow the purchase policy. Any purchases
of goods or services without proper authorization, which states in this policy,
will not be paid for by the City.
(Ord. 2-03. Passed 2-27-03.)

         (Ord. 13-04. Passed 7-8-04.)
133.04 RESPONSIBLE BIDDING ON CITY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS REQUIRED.
   (a)   Purpose. This section is designed to prevent fraud, collusion,
favoritism, conflicts of interest, cronyism, and improvidence in the awarding
of public construction projects. This section seeks to focus attention on the
public’s best interest, rather than private or special interests. This section
embodies the belief that the public’s interest is best served where
construction services and supplies are obtained through an open, public,
transparent, competitive process in which the maximum number of contractors are
encouraged to participate. The provisions of this section shall be interpreted
and applied with a view to promoting these overriding principles and purposes.
   (b)   Definitions.
      (1)   “Bidder” shall mean an individual, partnership, corporation or
other entity that responds to the City’s advertisement for bids.

      (5)   “Service Director” shall mean the Service Director of the City of
Uhrichsville.
      (6)   “Construction Contract” shall mean any agreement between the City

public improvement (“Public Projects”), that is estimated to cost in excess of
fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), in accordance with the procedures
established in Ohio R.C. 735.05 through 735.09. For the erection, repair,
alteration, or rebuilding of a public building of a public building,
institution, or other public improvement, that exceeds fifty thousand dollars
($50,000.00), the Council of the City of Uhrichsville shall direct the Mayor of
the City of Uhrichsville to solicit three written quotes. For any public, the
cost of which is less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), the Mayor of
the City of Uhrichsville shall not be required to obtain competitive bids or to
solicit three written quotes for the same.
      (2)   Contracts authorized b subsection (c)(1) hereof may be made through

and approved by the Council of the City of Uhrichsville. Subsections (c)(3)A.
through L. hereof shall not apply to any construction contracts with an
estimated cost of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) or less. For any
construction contracts with an estimated cost exceeding fifty thousand dollars
($50,000.00), the Council of the City of Uhrichsville shall determine the
lowest, best, responsive, and responsible bidder through the process of
competitive bidding. In order for any bidder submitting a competitive bid under

bidder, the bidder shall meet the following criteria:

potential bidders. Additionally, the contract entered into between the City of

153.01 SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (a)   The City affirms a policy that sexual harassment of its employees is
prohibited. All employees, will be subject to discipline, up to and including
discharge, for any act of sexual harassment which in the judgment of the City
they have committed.
   (b)   Definitions.
      (1)   “Employee” includes all department personnel, both sworn and
civilian.
      (2)   “Sexual harassment” includes any unwarranted or repeated verbal or
physical sexual advances, sexually explicit, provocative, or suggestive
statements, innuendo, or comments, or sexually oriented conduct of physical
conduct, made by another employee which are unreasonably offensive or
objectionable to the recipient or which reasonably interferes with the
recipients work performance.
      (3)   “Unwanted conduct” includes any conduct, verbal or physical, which
is of ethnic, racial, or religious nature, which reasonably causes the
recipient discomfort or humiliation, or which reasonably interferes with the
recipients work performance.
      (4)   “Shall” is mandatory, not permissive.
   (c)   (1)   It shall be a violation of the City’s policy prohibiting sexual
harassment for any employee, male or female, managerial, supervisory or hourly,
to in any way harass another employee by making unwelcome sexual advances, by
either directly or indirectly requesting sexual favors, or by engaging in any
other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature which
either constitutes or affects the terms or conditions of any employee’s
employment with the City. It is also a violation for any employee to require or
request, directly or indirectly, that any employee submit to such conduct as a
basis for, or as a factor in, any employment decisions affecting such employee.
This policy also forbids any employee from engaging in any conduct which has
the effect of either directly or indirectly creating or contributing to an
intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment because of such
conduct.
      (2)   The City will neither condone nor knowingly fail to take
appropriate steps to prohibit the sexual harassment of any of its employees.
All employees, including supervisors and department heads, will be subject to
discipline, up to and including discharge, for any act of sexual harassment
which, in the judgment of the City, they are found to have committed.
      (3)   Anyone who is party to an unwelcome romantic relationship, in
violation of this policy, should bring a complaint under this policy.
   (d)   (1)   Any employee who believes that he or she is being subjected to
sexual harassment in violation of this policy should report the alleged
harassment to the department head or to the Mayor. In so doing, the employee
should clearly state that he or she believes that he or she is the victim of
sexual harassment and that the employee is reporting the same pursuant to this
policy. Such written complaint or request for investigation shall specify the
nature of the conduct which is alleged to have violated this policy, the
individual which is alleged to have violated this policy, the individual or
individuals who are alleged to have engaged in said conduct, the dates, times,
and places of said conduct, as well as any other information which the City
deems necessary for its investigation.
      (2)   Upon receiving a complaint of sexual harassment or a request for
investigation of the same, the department head or Mayor will investigate the
matter. In so doing, it may require that all employees who possess knowledge of
the alleged incident or of similar incidents to cooperate in its investigation
by fully and accurately responding to its inquiries in this regard. The failure
of any employee, including a complaining employee, to satisfactorily cooperate
in such an investigation will be deemed sufficient grounds for discipline.
      (3)   Making a complaint of sexual harassment is a serious matter. Any
employee who has, in the judgment of the City knowingly requested an
investigation under false pretense or who knowingly submitted false,
inaccurate, or otherwise misleading information to the City in connection with
its investigation of an alleged incident of sexual harassment shall be subject
to discipline.
      (4)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, no employee will be subject to any
form of retaliation of disciplinary action for making or pursuing a complaint
of sexual harassment of a request for investigation of an alleged incident of
sexual harassment, which complaint or request is made in good faith.
   (e)   Should any complaining employee, after the investigation of any
complaint of sexual harassment, disagree with the action of the City in the
matter, said complaining employee may have such action reviewed by a grievance
committee made up of the Law Director, acting as chairman and two Councilmen.
   (f)   The City will keep such complaints of sexual harassment confidential
to the extent that this is possible and still conduct an investigation.
(Ord. 15-97. Passed 7-10-97.)
153.02 EMPLOYEES AUTHORIZED TO RUN FOR NON-CITY OFFICE.
   The City does hereby authorize any City employee, whether in the classified
civil service or not, to run for non-City elected office at any partisan
election without any repercussion or action taken whatsoever by the City of
Uhrichsville.
(Ord. 1-00. Passed 1-13-00.)
153.03 USE OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA BY EMPLOYEES.
   (a)   The City of Uhrichsville, Ohio strives to provide a safe work
environment and encourages personal health for City employees. Concerning this,
Council considers the use or abuse of drugs or alcohol on the job to be an
unsafe and counter-productive work practice. It is therefore City policy that
an employee found with alcohol, illegal drugs, or controlled substances in his/
her system, or in possession of, using, selling, trading, or offering for sale
illegal drugs, controlled substances, or alcohol during working hours, will be
subject to disciplinary action, including immediate discharge from employment.
Conduct prohibited by this Policy includes possession, use, purchase or sale of
drugs or alcohol on City property and anywhere the City employee is located
while on City time and City business.
   (b)   This Policy specifically prohibits the possession, distribution, sale,
transfer, or use of any form of marijuana, cannabinoid, or cannabidiol (even if
legally obtained) in the workplace by a City employee, while on duty, or while
operating any City machinery, equipment or vehicle, and will subject an
employee to disciplinary action including immediate discharge from employment.
A positive urine, blood or hair follicle screen for any form of marijuana,
cannabinoid or cannabidiol shall be considered a violation of this Policy and
grounds for disciplinary action.
   (c)   Conduct prohibited by this Policy also includes reporting to work
under the influence of drugs or alcohol. An employee reporting for work visibly
impaired is unable to properly perform required duties and will not be allowed
to work. If possible, the impaired employee's supervisor should first seek
another supervisor's opinion of the employee's status. Then the supervisor
should consult privately with the employee, to rule out any problems that may
have been caused by prescription drugs. If, in the opinion of the supervisor,
the employee is considered impaired, the employee should be sent home,
depending on the determination of the observed impairment, accompanied by the
supervisor or another employee, if necessary. An impaired employee should not
be allowed to drive.
   (d)   Other than marijuana, cannabinoid or cannabidiol prohibited by this
Policy above, prescription medication prescribed by a City employee's physician
may be taken during work hours, in a manner consistent with the physician's
instructions, if the medication does not impair the employee's ability to
perform the essential functions of his/her job without endangering the employee
or others. The City employee should notify his/her supervisor if the proper use
of prescription medication will impact the employee's work performance. Use of
medications prescribed for another person, or abuse of prescription medications
will not be tolerated. It is the responsibility of a City employee's supervisor
to consult with the employee whenever the supervisor observes a change in
performance that suggests the employee has a problem with performing his/her
essential job duties due to that employee's use of prescription medications.
   (e)   A City employee may be required to submit to a drug or alcohol
screening in the event the employee's supervisor suspects that the employee is
under the influence of drugs (including prescription medication) and/or
alcohol.
(Ord. 7-19. Passed 7-11-19.)
TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court
 
 
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipalty and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

171.02 Payment of cost of confinement.

171.01 COMMUNITY SERVICE WORK.
   (a)   When an offender is convicted of a misdemeanor, the Court may offer to
the offender, as a condition of probation that would be in addition to the
required conditions of probation and the discretionary conditions of probation
that may be imposed, that the offender be required to perform supervised
community service work under the authority of the City. Supervised community
service work shall not be required as a condition of probation under this
section unless the offender agrees to perform the supervised community service
work offered as a condition of probation by the Court. The Court may require an
offender who agrees to perform work under those circumstances to deposit with
the Court a reasonable fee to procure a policy or policies of liability
insurance to cover the period of time during which the offender will perform
the community service work.
   (b)   The supervised community service work that may be imposed as a
condition of probation shall be subject to the following limitations:
      (1)   The Court shall fix the period of community service work that is
imposed as a condition of probation and distribute the period over weekends or
over other appropriate times that will allow the offender to continue at his
occupation or to care for his family. The period of community service work
fixed by the Court and imposed as a condition of probation shall not exceed an
aggregate of eighty hours.
      (2)   The City must agree to accept the offender for community service
work before the Court requires him to perform work for it.
      (3)   The Court shall only order the offender to perform community
service work for the City or an agency of the City.
      (4)   Community service work that a Court requires under this section
shall be supervised by an official of the City or its designated agency or by a
person designated by the City or its designated agency. The official or
designated person shall be qualified for the supervision by education, training
or experience, and shall periodically report in writing to the Court concerning
the conduct of the offender in performing the work.
171.02 PAYMENT OF COST OF CONFINEMENT.
   (a)   Any person convicted of a criminal offense other than a minor
misdemeanor and who as a consequence thereof, is confined in the Tuscarawas
County Jail, Uhrichsville Municipal Jail, or any other jail or confinement
facility, shall reimburse the City for its expenses incurred by reason of his
or her confinement, including but not limited to, the expenses relating to the
providing of food, clothing, medical care and shelter.
   (b)   The Law Director is hereby authorized to institute any appropriate
civil suit in the Tuscarawas County Court of Common Pleas or the Tuscarawas
County Court for recovery of the expenses referred to in subsection (a), the
amount of the reimbursement to be determined by the Court pursuant to Ohio R.C.

defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or

complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left

When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this section, the chief

   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into

vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the
property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give
the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator
may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor
vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing
service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available
at the time of the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to

the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.

removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the person
from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it has
been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.

storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.
      (3)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (4)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains

      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the
transaction. Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the
owner or operator. Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall
move the vehicle so that the vehicle is not parked on the private property
established as a private tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the
private property or in violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,

as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.

two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the law enforcement agency of the
municipal corporation concerning all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
         C.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
         D.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may be

owner, operator or lienholder of the vehicle, and requests information
pertaining to the vehicle.
   (f)   (1)   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance
with this section, within three business days of the removal, the towing
service or storage facility from which the vehicle may be recovered shall cause

of Motor Vehicles, that are capable of providing real-time access to owner and
lienholder information.
      (2)   The towing service or storage facility may search the National

search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.

of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and

violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
 
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is

313.05 SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

   (a)   No person shall place, maintain or display upon or in view of any
street any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device which purports to be,
is an imitation of or resembles a traffic control device or railroad sign or
signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or hides from view
or interferes with the effectiveness of any traffic control device or any
railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit upon any street any traffic sign or signal bearing
thereon any commercial advertising. This section does not prohibit either the
erection upon private property adjacent to streets of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for traffic
control devices, or the erection upon private property of traffic control
devices by the owner of real property in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.211 and

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27,
the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

identification card is now issued in this state. The Registrar or a deputy
registrar shall destroy any such license, temporary instruction permit, or

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

that order.
   (b)   Without limiting or precluding the consideration of any other evidence
in determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5)
of this section has occurred, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the
offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the operator of the
motor vehicle owned by the offender or under the offender’s control is in a
category described in subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5) of this section

      (2)   A.   If, within three years of a violation of subsection (a)(1),
(2) or (3) of this section, the offender previously has pleaded guilty to or

the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to
the state of the vehicle involved in the offense. If issued, the order shall be
issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as
determined by publications of the national automobile dealer’s association. The
proceeds from any fine imposed under this subsection shall be distributed in
accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the
registration of the vehicle.

delinquent child for a violation of this section or a substantially similar
municipal ordinance shall not be admissible as evidence in any civil action
that involves the offender or delinquent child who is the subject of the
conviction, plea, or adjudication and that arises from the wrongful entrustment
of a motor vehicle.

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be
ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community
service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an offender to complete a
term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect
criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.

   (f)   (1)   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight or
axle limit of a vehicle and its load is unlawful may require the driver of said
vehicle to stop and submit to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-
contained, portable, sealed scale specially adapted to determining the wheel
loads of vehicles on highways; a sealed scale permanently installed to a fixed
location, having a load receiving element specially adapted to determining the
combined load of all wheels on a single axle or on a success of axles of a
highway vehicle, or a sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded
or unloaded.
      (2)   The driver of such vehicle shall, if necessary be directed to
proceed to the nearest available set of sealed scales to accomplish the
weighing, provided such scales are within a reasonable distance where such
vehicle is stopped. Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be
held by the police officer, for reasonable times, to accomplish the weighing as
prescribed by this section.
      (3)   All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and
its load shall be annually compared by municipality, county, or state sealer
with the State’s standards or proved by the State and such scales shall not be
sealed if they do not conform to the standards approved by the State.
      (4)   At each end of permanently installed scale, there shall be a
straight approach to the same plane as the platform, sufficient length and
width to insure the level positioning of the vehicles during weight
determinations.
      (5)   During the determination of weight by compact, self-contained
portable scales, they shall be used on level terrain of sufficient length and
weight to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed.
      (6)   Whenever such officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines
that the weight is unlawful, he may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a
suitable place and remain until such portion of the load is removed as
necessary to reduce the weight of such vehicle to the limit permitted under
Sections 5577.01 and 5577.14, inclusive of the Ohio Revised Code or provisions
of this Code.
      (7)   A police officer, upon seeing a vehicle that exceeds the maximum
allowable number of axles, may be stopped and inspected by the Police or
Director of Public Safety and City Services.
   (g)   Any determination by the Director of City Services and Public Safety
can be appealed, within 30 days of the Director’s order, by submitting an
application to Council indicating the reasons and concerns with the order by
the Director. Council can override the Director, with a two-thirds vote of
members present, if Council so chooses.

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed
or movable signs.

presented to the Clerk of Courts Title Office in order to obtain a Certificate
of Title for the golf cart.

intended to be a safety inspection, but rather an inspection to solely
determine if the vehide is equipped with all of the equipment required in
Section
376.02(d) above. As such, neither the City of Uhrichsville, Ohio nor the
Uhrichsville Police Chief assumes any responsibility for the functioning

commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.

   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years

         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself

evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
   
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.

501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
         "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the
      facts presented to you from the witness stand, to evaluate
      such testimony and to determine its quality and worth or its
      lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
 
   (b)   When strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
 
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
 
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated association, estate, trust or other commercial or legal entity.
"Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a governmental
agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 Type of Misdemeanor                         Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

otherwise reasonably determined, notice shall be posted in the pound or animal
shelter both describing the dog and place where seized and advising the unknown
owner that unless the dog is redeemed within three days, it may thereafter be
sold or destroyed according to law. If the dog is wearing a valid registration
tag or the identity of the owner, keeper or harborer is otherwise reasonably
determined, notice shall be given by certified mail to such owner, keeper or

second degree. In addition, the court may order the offender to forfeit the
animal or livestock and may provide for its disposition including, but not
limited to, the sale of the animal or livestock. If an animal or livestock is

complaints on the basis of studies carried out by its staff or volunteers
authorized by the Board.

such investigations as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and issues. Such
investigations shall be conducted within fourteen business days after the
filing of the complaint. The investigation may be extended when deemed
necessary by the Chairman of the Fair Housing Board. If the Secretary shall
determine that there are reasonable grounds to believe a violation has occurred
he shall attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of initial conference and
persuasion with all interested parties and such representatives as the parties
may choose to assist them. Conciliation conferences shall be informal and
nothing said or done during such initial conferences shall be made public by
any member of the Board or its staff unless the parties agree thereto in
writing.
 
   (c)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to
writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties,
which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not constitute an
admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent agreements shall
be signed on behalf of the Board by its chairman.
 
   (d)   The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Commission, Ohio Civil Rights Commission, Tuscarawas County Board
of Realtors, or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and any
other person or group regarding any matter before the Board.
 
   (e)   If the Secretary determines that the complaint lacks reasonable
grounds upon which to base a violation of this article, he shall so inform the
Board and the Board may in its discretion dismiss such complaint or order such
further investigation as may be necessary; provided, that the Board shall not
dismiss such complaint without first affording either party an opportunity to
appear before the Board.
 
   (f)   If the Secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a violation
of this article, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a complaint is not
susceptible of conciliation he shall so notify the Board and the Board shall
thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a violation of this
chapter has been committed. The Board shall serve upon the respondent a written
statement of charges and a summons and shall serve upon all interested parties
a notice of the time and place of the hearing. The respondent or his authorized
counsel may file and amend such statements with the Board prior to the hearing
date as it deems necessary in support of its position. The hearing shall be
opened to the public. The hearing shall be held not less than fifteen calendar
days nor more than thirty calendar days after service of the statement of
charges and summons. The summons so issued must be signed by two members of the
Board and the issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of named
persons and the production of relevant documents and records. The failure to
comply with a summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The
interested parties may, at their option, appear before the Board in person or
by a duly authorized representative and may have the assistance of an attorney.
The parties may present testimony and evidence and the right to cross examine
witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony and evidence shall be given under
oath or by affirmation. The Secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing
which record shall be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon
request by any principal party to the proceeding. The Board shall furnish such
party a copy of the hearing record, at such cost as the Board deems
appropriate.
 
   (g)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board determines upon the
preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has violated
this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Law Director in
executive session, state its findings to and cause the Law Director to prepare
and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person complained
against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take such
affirmative action as will effectuate the purpose of this chapter, with notice
that if the Board upon investigation by the secretary determines that the
person complained against has not after fifteen calendar days following service
of the Board's order complied with the order the Board will recertify the
matter to the Law Director for enforcement.
   The Solicitor shall seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in
the name of the Fair Housing Board of the City before a court of competent
jurisdiction.
 
   (h)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board determines upon the
preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained against
has not violated this chapter, the Board shall so state and publish its
findings and issue its orders dismissing the complaint.

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section

section.

545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in

545.05 or
 545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active
duty service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those
offenses may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a
single offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose
of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

of stormwater quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote andmaintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City of Uhrichsville:
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the City of Uhrichsville to:
      (1)   Control storm water runoff from their property and ensure that all

maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff

      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the City of Uhrichsville's
future expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.

predevelopment runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to meet the following
criteria:
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources.
The SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the physical, biological, and chemical integrity
of the water resources receiving stormwater discharges from the site.
Acceptable practices shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project and complies with City of
Uhrichsville's riparian setback requirements if applicable.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the siteas practicable.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
         E.   Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of Rainwater and Land Development or another design manual
acceptable for use by the City of Uhrichsville and Ohio EPA SCMs that meet the
criteria in this regulation, and additional criteria required by the City of
Uhrichsville's municipal engineer, shall comply with this regulation.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use. SCMs shall be designed to achieve
the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be compatible with
the proposed post construction use of the site, to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots. Areas developed for a
subdivision shall provide stormwater management and water quality controls for
the development of all subdivided lots. This shall include provisions for lot
grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding during the 100- year,
twenty-four (24)-hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-
development runoff patterns, volumes, and peaks from each lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources.  SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as
required in Section
921.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with the City of
Uhrichsville's erosion and sediment control requirements and the City of
Uhrichsville's riparian setback requirements, all as determined by the City of
Uhrichsville's municipal engineer.
      (5)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels. All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, twenty-four (24)-hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and
conveyance channels, the applicant shall consider public safety as a design
factor and alternative designs must be implemented where site limitations would
preclude a safe design.
      (6)   Exemption. The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
921.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the City ofUhrichsville's
municipal engineer that the site is part of a larger common plan of development
where the stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by an
existing SCMs, or if the storm water management requirements for the site are
provided by practices defined in a regional or local stormwater management plan
approved by the City of Uhrichsville's municipal engineer.
      (7)   Minimum size of Disturbance. The minimum size of disturbance is 1.0
Ac. if the projects disturbance is less than 1.0 Ac. then the applicant shall
follow all state and local laws, but full submissions are not required.
      (8)   Maintenance. All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements approved by the City of
Uhrichsville's municipal engineer as detailed in Section
921.08.
      (9)   Ownership.  Unless otherwise required by the City of Uhrichsville,
SCMs serving multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot held and
maintained by an entity of common ownership or, if compensated by the property
owners, by the City of Uhrichsville. SCMs serving single lots shall be placed
on these lots, protected within an easement, and maintained by the property
owner.
      (10)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage. Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and
grubbing practices; and maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and
through these areas. Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide
perpetual management of runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving
stream's physical, chemical and biological characteristics are protected, and
ecological functions are maintained.
      (11)   Preservation of Wetland Hydrology. Concentrated stormwater runoff
from SCMs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters the wetlands in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and
wetland flora. The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope. Practices such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration
basins, conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent
streams, depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the
wetland hydrology.
If the applicant proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a hydrological
analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the proposed discharge matches
the predevelopment hydroperiods and hydrodynamics that support the wetland.
      (12)   Soil Preservation and Post-Construction Soil Restoration. To the
maximum extent practicable leave native soil undisturbed and protect from
compaction during construction. Except for areas that will be covered by
impervious surface or have been incorporated into an SCM, the soil moisture-
holding capacity of areas that have been cleared and graded must be restored to
that of the original, undisturbed soil to the maximum extent practicable. Areas
that have been compacted or had the topsoil or duff layer removed should be
amended using the following steps: 1. till subsoil to a depth of fifteen (15) -
eighteen (18) inches, 2. incorporate compost through top twelve (12) inches, 3.
Replace with stockpiled site or imported suitable topsoil to a minimum depth of
four (4) inches.
   
   (b)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria. All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Surface water protection. The City of Uhrichsville's municipal
engineer may allow modification to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other
surface waters only if the applicant shows proof of compliance with all
appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other
applicable federal, state, and local agencies as required in Section
921.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with the City of
Uhrichsville's erosion and sediment control requirements and the City of
Uhrichsville's riparian setback requirements, all as determined by the City of
Uhrichsville's engineer. At a minimum, stream relocation designs must show how
the project will minimize changes to the vertical stability, floodplain form,
channel form, and habitat of upstream and downstream channels on and off the
property.
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges. Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the storm water quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City of Uhrichsville's
municipal engineer that off-site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the
development site in a manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream
flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow.  The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed one and one-half (1.5) acres. Flow shall be directed into an open
channel, storm sewer, or other SCMs from areas too long and/or too large to
maintain sheet flow, all as determined by the City of Uhrichsville's municipal
engineer.
      (4)   Open channels. Unless otherwise allowed by the City of
Uhrichsville's municipal engineer, drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided
by an open channel with vegetated banks and designed to carry the ten (10)-
year, twenty-four (24)-hour stormwater runoff from upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open drainage systems. Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under City of Uhrichsville zoning or where the use of an open drainage
system affects public health or safety, all as determined by the City of
Uhrichsville's municipal engineer. The following criteria shall be used to
design storm sewer systems when necessary:
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the ten (10)-year, twenty-four (24)-hour storm, and that
the hydraulic grade line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of
the overlying roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the
roadway during a twenty-five (25)- year, twenty-four (24)-hour storm. The
system shall be designed to meet these requirements when conveying the flows
from the contributing drainage area within the proposed development and
existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream from the development.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is twelve (12) inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private
systems, subject to the approval of the City of Uhrichsville's engineer.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tail water elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the City of Uhrichsville:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum twenty-five (25)-year, twenty-four
(24)-hour storm.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
percent (25%) of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of one (1) foot of box
culverts and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or
conveyance must be sized to carry the twenty-five (25)-year storm under these
conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be twelve (12) inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a ten
(10)-fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions.
Erosion protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly
control entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of five (5) square miles or larger
shall incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict
head loss differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-
year storm event.
         I.   New Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile
through a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the
100-year, twenty-four (24)-hour storm, or the 100-year flood elevation as
determined by FEMA, whichever is more restrictive. If a bridge exists down
stream of a proposed drainage outlet the existing bridge shall be reviewed and
the storm water discharge reduced so as not to increase the backwater elevation
at the existing bridge.
      (7)   Overland flooding. Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey storm water runoff from the 100-year, twenty-four (24)-hour storm event
to an adequate receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is
contained within the drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not
cause flooding of buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water
surface elevation along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below
the finished grade elevation of all structures. When designing the flood
routing paths, the conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be
taken into consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation.  In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the City of Uhrichsville
must be compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume. First
consideration for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be
given to areas where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new
floodplain within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also
be given to enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for
floodplain fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing
watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by the City of Uhrichsville, reductions
in volume due to floodplain fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries
of the development. Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must
reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The
use of vertical retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
NOTE: The Section #8 above should be coordinated with the City of
Uhrichsville's riparian setback ordinance. The requirement for compensatory
floodplain storage is only in effect when the riparian setback does not include
the entire 100-year floodplain, when the City of Uhrichsville grants a variance
that allows filling in the floodplain due to site constraints, or when the City
of Uhrichsville's Engineer determines that stream or floodplain restoration is
needed to meet the objectives of this regulation.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control.
      (1)   Direct runoff to an SCM.  The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more of the following SCMs. These practices are listed in
Table 2 of this regulation and shall be designed to meet the following general
performance standards:
         A.   Extended detention facilities that detain stormwater; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled stormwater to a water
resource.
         B.   Infiltration facilities that retain stormwater; promote settling,
filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured storm
water into the ground. The City of Uhrichsville's municipal engineer may
require a soil engineering report to be prepared for the site to demonstrate
that any proposed infiltration facilities meet these performance standards.
For sites less than five (5) acres, but required to create a comprehensive
stormwater management plan, the City of Uhrichsville's municipal engineer may
approve other SCMs if the applicant demonstrates to the City of Uhrichsville's
municipal engineer's satisfactionthat these SCMs meet the objectives of this
regulation as stated in Section
921.09(c)(6).
         C.   For sites greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5)
acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will
disturb five (5) or more acres, the City of Uhrichsville's municipal engineer
may approve other SCMs if the applicant demonstrates to the City of
Uhrichsville's municipal engineer's satisfaction that these SCMs meet the
objectives of this regulation as stated in Section 921.09(c)(6), and has prior
written approval from the Ohio EPA.
         D.   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by the City of Uhrichsville's engineer may approve SCMs not included
in Table 2 of this regulation but must show compliance with the current version
of the Ohio Department of Transportation "Location and Design Manual, Volume
Two Drainage Design".
Note: Per Rainwater and Land Development, the water quality volume (WQv)
orifice shall be an anti-clogging or non-clogging design such as a reverse
slope pipe or a perforated tile pipe with gravel filter. Alternatively, the
City of Uhrichsville may encourage the use of other SCMs for smaller drainage
areas.
      (2)   Criteria applying to all SCMs.  SCMs chosen must be sized to treat
the water quality volume (WQv) and to ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality
Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1). Also, the designer must review the requirements
of the latest version of the OEPA Construction permit and use the most
restrictive requirements.
         A.   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods: 1
            1.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the City of
Uhrichsville's municipal engineer that uses continuous hydrologic simulation;
site-specific hydrologic parameters, including impervious area, soil
infiltration characteristics, slope, and surface routing characteristics;
proposed SCMs controlling the amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and
local long-term hourly records, or
            2.   Using the following equation:
            WQv = C*P* A/12
            where terms have the following meanings:
            WQv = water quality volume in acre-feet
            C = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than
            1 in.P = 0.75 inch precipitation depth
            A = area draining into the stormwater practice, in acres.
Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA) for use in determining the WQv can be determinedusing the list in Table 1
or using the following equation to calculate therunoff coefficient.
            C=0.858i3-0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:
            i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
   
Table 1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted
average. For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage area to the storm
water treatment
structure is Low Density Residential, 30% is High Density Residential, and 10%
is Open
Space, the runoff coefficient is calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+
(0.1 )(0.2) = (0.35)
         B.   An additional volume equal to twenty percent (20%) of the WQv
shall be incorporated into the stormwater practice for sediment storage. This
volume shall be incorporated into the sections of stormwater practices where
pollutants will accumulate.
         C.   Each individual SCM must be sized to treat the WQv associated
with its entire contributing drainage area. Exceptions to this may be granted
by the City of Uhrichsville's municipal engineer and/or the OEPA on a case-by-
case basis.
         D.   Stormwater quality management practices shall be designed such
that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment and protect against
downstream bankerosion, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events as defined in Table 2.
         E.   Sites within watersheds of cold-water habitat streams shall
include SCMs to infiltrate the water quality volume or reduce the temperature
of discharged runoff. SCMs that reduce the temperature of discharged runoff
include bioretention, permeable pavement, underground detention, and
incorporation of shading and infiltration in parking lot design.
         F.   Each practice shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection Plan and Maintenance Agreement for the site.

1 Practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv shall empty within 48 hours
to provide storage for subsequent storm events.
2 The use of a forebay and micropool is required on all dry extended detention
basins. Each is to be sized at a minimum ten percent (10%) of the WQv.
3  Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized with at least 0.75*WQv.
4 Extended detention shall be provided for the WQv above the permanent water
pool.
5 The surface ponding area shall completely empty within twenty-four (24)
hours so that there is no standing water. Shorter drawdown times are
acceptable as long as design criteria in Rainwater and Land Development have
been met.
6  This includes grassed linear bioretention, which was previously titled
enhanced water quality swale.
7 Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with twenty-five
percent (25%) of the WQv in a pool and seventy-five percent (75%) in marshes.
The EDv above the permanent pool must be equal to the WQv.
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
         A.   Infiltration facilities should be designed to meet all criteria
in Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove coarse sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         C.   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site. No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities.
         A.   The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
half of the water quality volume in less than one-third (1/3rd) of the drain
time. The outlet shall be designed to minimize clogging, vandalism,
maintenance, and promote the capture of floatable pollutants.
         B.   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            1.   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run to
rise ratio of 4:1 or flatter.
            2.   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than four (4)
feet shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least eight (8)
feet and no more than fifteen (15) feet outward from the normal water edge. The
eight (8) feet wide portion of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall
have an average depth of six (6) inches below the permanent pool to promote the
growth of aquatic vegetation. The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no
more than fifteen (15) inches below the permanent pool to minimize drowning
risk to individuals who accidentally or intentionally enter the basin, and to
limit growth of dense vegetation in a manner that allows waves and mosquito
predators to pass through the vegetation. The maximum slope of the aquatic
bench shall be 10 (H) to 1 (V). The aquatic bench shall be planted with native
plant species comparable to wetland vegetation that are able to withstand
prolonged inundation. The use of invasive plant species is prohibited.
            3.   A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at basin inlets. The forebay and rnicropool volume shall
be equal to at least ten percent (10%) of the water quality volume (WQv).
            4.   Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency drain,
where practicable, so that the basin may be emptied if the primary outlet
becomes clogged and/or to drain the permanent pool to facilitate maintenance.
The emergency drain should be designed to drain by gravity where possible.
Note: The Section below identifies the criteria that are currently being used
by the OEPA to assess equivalency of alternative practices that are not listed
in Table 2. This section can be modified to meet the City of Uhrichsville's
needs.
      (5)   Criteria for the Acceptance of Alternative post-construction SCMs.
The applicant may request approval from the City of Uhrichsville's municipal
engineer for the use of alternative structural post- construction SCMs if the
applicant shows to the satisfaction of the City of Uhrichsville's municipal
engineer that these SCMs are equivalent in pollutant removal and runoff flow/
volume reduction effectiveness to those listed in Table 2. If the site is
greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5) acres but part of a larger
common plan of development or a sale which will disturb five (5) or more acres,
prior approval from the Ohio EPA is necessary. To demonstrate the equivalency,
the applicant must show:
         A.   The alternative SCM has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of eighty percent (80%), using the Level II Technology
Acceptance Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         B.   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected SCM is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State. The discharge
rate from the SCM will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate
one of the following conditions:
            1.   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            2.   The development will create less than one (1) acre of
impervious surface.
            3.   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where one hundred
percent (100%) of the project area is already impervious surface and the
stormwater discharge is directed into an existing storm sewer system.
            4.   The stormwater drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than five percent (5%) of the water area upstream
of the development site, unless a (TMDL) has identified water quality problems
in the receiving surface water of the State.
   (d)   Stormwater Quantity Control. The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a one (1)-year, twenty-four (24)-
hour storm occurring on the same development drainage area under pre-
development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, twenty-four (24)-hour storm shall have peak
runoff discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent
size storms under pre-development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-
year storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this
requirement.
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method or other
hydrologic method approved by the City of Uhrichsville's municipal engineer,
the total volume (acre-feet) of runoff from a one (1)-year, twenty-four (24)-
hour storm occurring on the development drainage area before and after
development. These calculations shall meet the following standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            4.   Rainfall Depth - For the most accurate, up-to-date, location
specific rainfall data for stormwater design, use the Precipitation-Frequency
Atlas of the United States, NOAA Atlas 14, Vol 2(3). [available online: http://
hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.]
            5.   Temporal Distribution- Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events with a recurrence interval greater than one
(1) year. Include lot coverage assumptions used for full build out of the
proposed condition.
            6.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition shall reflect
the average type of land use over the past ten (10) years and not only the
current land use.
               i.    Pre-development Curve Numbers - For wooded or brushy
areas, use listed values from TR-55 NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, 1986 in good hydrologic condition. For meadows, use listed values.
For all other areas (including all types of agriculture), use pasture,
grassland, or range in good hydrologic condition.
               ii.   Post-development Curve Numbers - Open space areas shall
use post-construction HSGs from Rainwater and Land Development unless the soil
is amended after development according to the following protocol: till the
subsoil to fifteen (15)-eighteen (18) inches, then till using a chisel, spader,
or rotary tillage and incorporate compost through top twelve (12) inches,
replace topsoil to a minimum depth of four (4) inches. All undisturbed areas or
open space with amended soils shall be treated as "open space in good
condition."
            7.   Time of Concentration - Use velocity-based methods from (TR-55
NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel flow.
               i.   Maximum sheet flow length is 100 ft.
               ii.   Use the appropriate "unpaved" velocity equation for
shallow concentrated flow from Soil Conservation Service National Engineer
Handbook Section 4 - Hydrology (NEH-4).
            8.   The volume reduction provided by permeable pavement,
bioretention, or other LID SCMs may be subtracted from the post development
stormwater volume. Volume reductions for these practices may be demonstrated
using methods outlined in Rainwater and Land Development or a hydrologic model
acceptable to the City of Uhrichsville's municipal engineer.
         B.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface proposed in the site
description except in instances of engineered permeable pavement systems. From
the volumedetermined in Section
921.09(d)(3)A., determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the twenty-four (24)-hour Critical
Storm from Table 3.
   
            % increase= (lyr. Post Volume)/(lyr. Pre Volume)
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff
is:
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:          The Critical Storm will be:
--                        10                      1 year
10                        20                      2 year
20                        50                      5 year
50                        100                     10 year
100                       250                     25 year
250                       500                     50 year
500                       --                      100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a one (1)-year storm is thirty-five percent (35%); the
Critical Storm is a five (5)-year storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff
for all storms up to this frequency shall be control led so as not to exceed
the peak discharge rate from the one (1)-year frequency storm under pre-
development conditions in the development drainage area. The post-development
runoff from all less frequent storms need only be controlled to meet pre-
development peak discharge rates for each of those same storms.
   (e)   Stormwater Management on Redevelopment Projects.
      (1)   Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans for redevelopment
projects shall reduce existing site impervious areas by at least twenty percent
(20%). A one-for-one credit towards the twenty percent (20%) net reduction of
impervious area can be obtained through the use of green roofs. Where site
conditions prevent the reduction of impervious area, SCMs shall be implemented
to treat at least twenty percent (20%) of the WQv.
      (2)   When a combination of impervious area reduction and storm water
quality control facilities are used, ensure a twenty percent (20%) net
reduction of the site impervious area, provide for treatment of at least twenty
percent (20%) of the WQv, or a combination of the two.
      (3)   Where projects are a combination of new development and
redevelopment, the total water quality volume required to be treated shall be
calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the new development at
one hundred percent (100%) water quality volume and redevelopment at twenty
percent (20%).
      (4)   Where conditions prevent impervious area reduction or on-site
stormwater management for redevelopment projects, practical alternatives as
detailed in Section
921.10 may be approved by the City of Uhrichsville's municipal engineer. (Ord.
62-21. Passed 9-23-21.)
921.10 ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   (a)   When the City of Uhrichsville determines that site constraints
compromise the intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used
that result in an improvement of water quality and a reduction of stormwater
quantity. Such alternatives shall meet the following standards:
      (1)   Shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity and quality
control that would be achieved by the on-site controls required under this
regulation.
      (2)   Implemented in the same Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 12 watershed
unit as the proposed development project.
      (3)   The mitigation ratio of the water quality volume is 1.5 to 1 or the
water quality volume at the point of retrofit, whichever is greater.
      (4)   An inspection and maintenance agreement as described in Chapter
921.08(d)(10) is established to ensure operations and treatment in perpetuity.
      (5)   Obtain prior written approval from Ohio EPA.
   (b)   Alternative actions may include, but are not limited to the following.
All alternative actions shall be approved by the City of Uhrichsville's
municipal engineer:
      (1)   Fees, in an amount specified by the City of Uhrichsville to be
applied to City of Uhrichsville-wide SCMs .
      (2)   Implementation of off-site SCMs and/or the retrofit of an existing
practice to, increase quality and quantity control.
      (3)   Stream, floodplain, or wetland restoration.
      (4)   Acquisition or conservation easements on protected open space
significantly contributing to stormwater control such as wetland complexes.

   This Title One shall be known and may be cited as the "Subdivision
Regulations for Uhrichsville, Ohio" and shall hereinafter be referred to as
"these Regulations."
(Ord. 1389. Passed 1-10-80.)
1101.02 INTERPRETATION AND PURPOSE.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these Regulations
shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the protection of the
public health, safety and welfare. To protect the public among other purposes,
such provisions are intended to provide for a permanently wholesome community
environment, adequate public services and safer streets and highways. (Ord.
1389. Passed 1-10-80.)
1101.03 SCOPE.
   These Regulations shall not apply to any lot or lots forming a part of a
subdivision created and recorded prior to the effective date of these
Regulations. Nor is it intended by these Regulations to repeal, abrogate, annul
or in any way impair or interfere with existing provisions of other laws or
regulations, except those specifically repealed by these Regulations, or with
private restrictions placed upon property by deed, covenant, or other private
agreement, or with restrictive covenants running with the land to which the
County is a party. Where these Regulations impose a greater restriction upon
land than is imposed or required by such existing provisions of law,
resolution, contract or deed, the provisions of these Regulations shall
control. (Ord. 1389. Passed 1-10-80.)
1101.04 COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.
   Subdividers or developers of shopping centers, and other commercial as well
as industrial users must comply with the same requirements as residential
developers. Plans or written and signed statements regarding highway access
points and planted areas and buffer strips may be required where applicable.
(Ord. 1389. Passed 1-10-80.)
1101.05 ADMINISTRATION AND AUTHORITY GENERALLY.
   A major highway plan having been adopted by the Planning Commission
according to statutory requirements, and the Council by virtue of the
provisions of Ohio R.C. Chapter 711 is authorized, subject to the holding of
required public hearings, to adopt rules and regulations covering plats or
subdivisions of land, and to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove
plats or subdivisions of land falling within its jurisdiction. Administration
of the rules and regulations contained herein shall be the responsibility of
the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 1389. Passed 1-10-80.)
1101.06 JURISDICTION.
   (a)   The provisions of these Regulations shall apply to all plats,
subdivisions and conveyances of land in the Municipality as described in Ohio
R.C. Section 711.09. The Planning Commission shall have the power of final
approval of the plats.
   (b)   No person shall subdivide or lay out into lots any land within the
Municipality unless it is by a plat complying with the regulations herein
contained, and no plat shall be recorded and no lot or land shall be sold from
any such plat until such plat has been approved as herein required.
   (c)   The design and layout of all subdivisions shall conform with the
requirements hereof. The subdivider shall make improvements and shall submit
preliminary and final plans, all in accordance with these Regulations.
   (d)   The division of a tract into five parcels or less, fronting upon an
existing street, and where the transfer is to be accomplished by the recording
of a deed rather than a plat, requires the approval of the Planning Commission
before it can be recorded. Such approval may be accomplished in the manner
provided in these Regulations.
(Ord. 1389. Passed 1-10-80.)
1101.07 PUBLIC HEARINGS.
   The Commission on its own initiative or upon petition by a citizen
neighboring property owner may, prior to acting on a preliminary map of a
subdivision, hold a hearing thereon at such time and upon such notice as the
Commission may designate. (Ord. 1389. Passed 1-10-80.)
1101.08 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   These Regulations shall be effective following adoption by the Planning
Commission and Council, after public hearing and certification to the Recorder
as provided by law. Henceforth, any other regulations previously adopted by
Council or the Planning Commission shall be deemed to be repealed. These
Regulations shall in no way affect any subdivision having received preliminary
approval by the Commission prior to the effective date, provided, however, that
no changes to the preliminary plan, as approved, are introduced by the
subdivider.
(Ord. 1389. Passed 1-10-80.)
1101.09 AMENDMENTS.
   The Council and Planning Commission may, after public hearing, amend,
supplement, or change these Regulations. Notice shall be given of the time and
place of such public hearing by publication in at least one newspaper of
general circulation in the local area thirty days prior to the holding of such
hearing. The amendment shall be on file in the office of the Planning

1113.01 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   (a)   The arrangement, character, extent, width and location of major,
secondary and minor streets or highways shall conform with the Official Highway
Plan for the Municipality, which is on file with the Service Director and the
provisions of these Regulations. Streets not contained in the Official
Thoroughfare Plan should conform to the recommendation of the Planning
Commission and proposed uses of land.
   (b)   Planned unit type development is encouraged by the Commission. Where
large subdivisions designed on the basis of neighborhood units are being
reviewed, consideration will be given to the placement of commercial areas and
public areas in relation both to the neighborhood unit being developed and to
other units that might be developed. Where small subdivisions are being
reviewed, the Planning Commission shall coordinate such subdivisions, to the
extent practicable, into units so that the same relationship with respect to
commercial areas and public areas may be realized. These Design Standards shall
be required in all areas except where special provisions are made for planned
unit developments and for a hillside development as specified in Chapter
1121 and in Chapter
1125. (Ord. 1389. Passed 1-10-80.)
1113.02 STREETS.
   (a)   Design and Arrangement.
      (1)   The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision
for the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining areas, or
their proper projection where adjoining land is not subdivided, insofar as they
may be deemed necessary for public requirements. Every subdivision shall have
access to a public right of way.
      (2)   The street and alley arrangement shall be such as not to cause
hardship to owners of adjoining property when they plat their own land and seek
to provide for convenient access to it. Residential streets shall be designed
so as to discourage through traffic, but offset streets should be avoided.
      (3)   The angle of an intersection between minor streets and major
streets should not vary by more than ten degrees from a right angle. All other
streets should intersect each other as near to a right angle as possible.
      (4)   The minimum curb radius at intersections subject to the approval of
the Municipal Engineer shall be twenty feet. Curbs shall be required for all
areas as noted in Chapter
1117.
      (5)   Residential streets shall be designed to discourage through traffic
which may otherwise use secondary or major highways, and whose origin and
destination are not within the subdivision. Residential streets extending for
considerable distance, parallel to any secondary or major street, should be
avoided.
   (b)   Alignment.
      (1)   Vertical.
         A.   For main thoroughfares, profile grades shall be connected by
vertical curves of a minimum length in multiples of fifty feet approximately
equivalent to twenty times and the algebraic difference between the rates of
grade, expressed in feet per hundred; for secondary and minor streets and
alleys, fifteen times.
         B.   For slope areas where the average topographic slope is fifteen
percent (15%) or greater refer to Hillside Standards, Chapter
1121.
      (2)   Minimum horizontal.

streets shall be fifty feet unless stated differently on the Major Highway Plan
of the Municipality.
      (3)   Local streets. The minimum width of local streets shall be fifty
feet and the pavement widths shall be in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter
1117 , except where there are unusual topographical or other physical
conditions, the Commission may require greater or lesser widths for rights of
way and pavements for local streets.
      (4)   Location. When a proposed subdivision is adjacent to or contains a
State highway, the developer and Commissioners should seek information from the
State Department of Transportation as to the status of such highway in
reference to width and direction, and also to access of such highway.
      (5)   Half-streets. Dedication of new half-streets shall not be
permitted. Where a dedicated or platted half-street or alley exists adjacent to
the tract being subdivided, the other half shall be platted, if deemed
necessary by the Commission.

thirty-eight feet. The maximum length for a cul-de-sac shall be 600 feet. The
minimum frontage or lot width shall be measured at the building line on any
cul-de-sac.
      (7)   Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets, designated to be so
permanently, shall not be permitted. Any dead-end street of a temporary nature,
if longer than 200 feet or fronted by existing lots, shall have a surfaced
turning area equal in diameter to the width of such street at its termination.
      (8)   Marginal access streets. 
         A.   Where a subdivision adjoins a major street, and the greater
dimension of the block fronts along such major street or highway, a marginal
access street shall be designated to provide access to subdivided parcels.

         No street grade shall be less than one percent (1%).
      (10)   Street name. New names are required for new streets in
unincorporated areas; the names shall meet with the approval of the Planning
Commission. No name shall be similar in spelling or pronunciation to that of an
existing street in a postal zone. Streets which are essentially contiguous
shall have the same name.
      (11)   Acceptance of streets.
         A.   The approval of a plat by Council shall be deemed to be an
acceptance of the dedication of any public street, road or highway dedicated in
such plat.
         B.   The Municipal Engineer shall check the construction by stages and
if the Engineer finds that such street is constructed in accordance with the
specifications set forth on the approved plat and that such street is in good
repair, then such finding, endorsed on the approved plat, shall constitute an
acceptance of the street for public use by the Municipality.
            (Ord. 1389. Passed 1-10-80.)
1113.03 ALLEYS.
   Alleys should be avoided in single-family or two-family districts. They may,
however, be required in multiple dwelling developments where they should have a
minimum width of twenty feet. Alleys are required in the rear of all commercial
and industrial lots, if no other provisions are made for adequate service
access or for parking. The right of way of such alleys shall not be less than
forty-five feet and dead-end alleys shall not be permitted.
(Ord. 1389. Passed 1-10-80.)
1113.04 BUILDING LINES AND EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Building Lines.
      (1)   Where the subdivided area is not under zoning control and is to be
used for residential purposes, the building lines shall be established
according to the following table, but in no case shall the front building line
be less than thirty feet from the right of way of the street or thoroughfare
upon which the lots front.
 
                      Minimum Average Distance
Lot Area (Square Feet) from Building Line to
                       Road Right of Way (Feet)
20,000 and over        40
13,600 to 20,000       35
7,500 to 13,600     30
4,800 to 7,500         25

herein may be required for commercial and industrial uses, and for residential
uses along major highways as determined by the Commission.
      (3)   For slope areas where the average topographic slope is fifteen
percent (15%) or greater, refer to Hillside Standards, Chapter
1121.
   (b)   Easements. Easements of at least five feet in width shall be provided
on each side of all rear lot lines and along side lot lines, where necessary,
for poles, wires, conduits and gas mains. Additional easements may also be
required along or across lots where engineering design or special conditions
may necessitate the installation of water and sewer lines outside public rights
of way. For lots facing on curvilinear streets, the rear easement should
consist of straight lines with a minimum number of points of deflection.
(Ord. 1389. Passed 1-10-80.)
1113.05 BLOCKS.
   (a)   (1)   No block shall be longer than 1,320 feet nor less than 500 feet
except in unusual circumstances. Where a subdivision adjoins a major highway,
the greater dimension of the block shall front along such major highway to
minimize the number of points of ingress or egress.
      (2)   For slope areas where the average topographic slope is fifteen
percent (15%) or greater, refer to Hillside Standards, Chapter
1121.
   (b)   Where blocks are over 750 feet in length, a crosswalk easement not
less than ten feet in width on or near the halfway point may be required, if
necessary, to provide proper access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers
and other facilities.
(Ord. 1389. Passed 1-10-80.)
1113.06 LOTS.
   (a)   The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all sublots will
provide satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly related to
topography and the character of the surrounding development.
   (b)   All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to street lines and
radial to curved street lines except where a variation to this rule will
provide a better street and sublot layout. Lots with double frontage except
when paralleling major highways will be avoided.
   (c)   (1)   No lot shall have less area or width than is required by the
Zoning Ordinance applying to the area in which it is located. If no zoning is
in effect, the following minimum lot area and width at the building line shall
be met:
 
Type of Development Group Water and
                    Sewer Available
Single-family       60' width
                    7,500 sq. ft.
Two-family          80' width
                    11,000 sq. ft.
Multi-family        120' width
                    4,000 sq. ft. per dwelling unit
Commercial          100' width
                    20,000 sq. ft.
Industrial          200' width
                    40,000 sq. ft.
      (2)   For slope areas where the average topographic slope is fifteen
percent (15%) or greater, refer to Hillside Standards, Chapter
1121.
   (d)   No lot shall be subdivided after acceptance of the original plat
except as provided in the Zoning Ordinance.
   (e)   No corner lot shall have a width at the building line of less than
seventy-five feet. Either of the two sides of a corner lot fronting on a street
may be designated the front lot, provided the rear yard shall always be
opposite the frontage so designated.
   (f)   The corners of lots as street intersections shall have a curve with a
minimum radius of twenty feet to the intersection of the property line.
(Ord. 1389. Passed 1-10-80.)
1113.07 PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES.
   (a)   General Considerations. Consideration shall be given to the allocation
of areas suitably located and of adequate size for playgrounds, school sites,
parks, and other outdoor recreational facilities as indicated on the
Comprehensive Plan and to be made available by one of the following methods:
      (1)   Dedication to public uses.
      (2)   Reservation of land for the use of property owners by deed or
covenant.
      (3)   Reservation for acquisition by a public agency within a period of
three years. Such reservation shall be made in such a manner as to provide for
release of the land to the subdivider in the event no public agency proceeds
with the purchase.
   (b)   Historic; Natural Features. Due regard shall be shown for preserving
outstanding cultural, historic or natural features such as scenic spots,
watercourses or exceptionally fine groves of trees. Dedication to and
acceptance by a public agency is usually the best means of assuring their
preservation.
   (c)   Easement Along Streams. Whenever any stream or important surface
drainage course is located within the area being subdivided, the subdivider
shall provide a permanent easement of sufficient width dedicated to the proper
authority for the purpose of widening, deepening, relocating, improving or
protecting the stream for drainage or public use.
   (d)   Land Subject to Flooding or Containing Poor Drainage Facilities. As a
safety measure for the protection of the health and welfare of the people of
the Municipality, Council shall reserve the right to disapprove any subdivision
which is subject to periodic flooding, contains extremely poor drainage
facilties or has other physical impairment. However, if the subdivider agrees
to make such improvements as will make the area completely safe for residential
occupancy, provided that in lieu of the improvements, the subdivider shall
furnish a surety bond or a certified check covering the cost of the required
improvements, the subdivision may be approved, subject, however, to the
approval of the County or Municipal Board of Health, Conservancy District, and
the Municipal Engineer.
(Ord. 1389. Passed 1-10-80.)
1113.08 MOBILE HOME SUBDIVISIONS.
   (a)   A mobile home subdivision shall contain a minimum of five acres unless
zoning requirements are greater, and shall be developed in the same manner as
required for any subdivision in the same area in which mobile home subdivisions
are permitted.
   (b)   The development standards for a mobile home subdivision shall be the
same as the requirements for single-family dwelling subdivisions.
(Ord. 1389. Passed 1-10-80.)
1113.09 TREES.
   Street trees, when planted, shall be located outside of the street right of
way of any sewer or water easements that may be adjacent to the street right of
way and planted in such manner as not to impair visibility at any corner or
corners. Subdividers or developers should retain existing trees wherever
possible and should plant only those trees listed below or varieties of
comparable habit and character.

            * To conform to applicable standards of the Major Highway Plan, as
determined by the Municipal Planning Commission and Municipal Engineer.
         B.   In certain instances, especially where a commercial area is
involved and no off-street parking facilities are provided and no parking is
permitted on the street at any time, a parking lane at least eight feet wide on
each side of the street and paved to the satisfaction of and in accordance with
the specifications approved by the Municipal Engineer may be required in
addition to the necessary number of lanes for moving traffic. Where pavement
widths greater than those specified herein are necessary, provision of the same
shall be discussed with the public officials having jurisdiction over the
planning and construction of public ways to determine whether or not public
expenditures for such additional width can or should be made simultaneosly with
the subdivider's improvement program.
      (2)   Subgrade. The subgrade shall be free of sod, vegetation matter or
other similar material. Where poor subsurface drainage conditions exist,
adequate drainage shall be installed. The subgrade shall be rolled with a
roller of not less than seven tons in weight. Subbase grade tolerance shall be
not more than one inch in sixteen feet. Subbase construction shall be subject
to the approval of the Municipal Engineer.
      (3)   Base course. Base course shall consist of one layer of bankrun
gravel three inches thick and a final layer of D-6 aggregate two inches thick,
each thoroughly compacted and graded with a crown of approximately one quarter
of an inch per footbase. A greater thickness may be required depending upon the
type of subsoil and subsurface drainage conditions and other pertinent factors.
All materials and construction procedures shall be subject to approval by the
Municipal Engineer.
      (4)   Surface course. Upon the expiration of the established maintenance
period for the base course, the surface course shall be constructed in
accordance with the appropriate standards as determined by the Municipal
Engineer. The minimum surface course shall consist of the following:

square yard. That prime shall be allowed to cure for at least five days before
applications of a double seal coat of 0.30 gallons of MC-4, MC-5, RS-2 or
another approved bituminous seal. Each application shall be covered with thirty
pounds of #6 crushed limestone or its equal for each course per square yard.
         B.   The right is reserved for the Municipal Engineer to determine the
proper type and time for the application of the surface course, but in no event
will the subdivider be required to defer the construction of the surface course
for a period in excess of that specified by the Municipal Engineer for the
completion of the required improvements as provided in subsection (j) hereof.
            The subdivider shall give three days' notice to the Municipal
Engineer as to the time when the construction of the base and surface courses
is to be started so that work may be inspected by the Muncipal Engineer or his
duly authorized agents. After the final rolling, the street or road shall be
closed to traffic for twenty-four hours.
      (5)   Concrete pavement. If the subdivider elects to construct concrete
pavement or if such type of pavement is required by the Municipality in order
to meet traffic needs, such concrete pavement shall have a minimum thickness of
six inches and shall meet the current T-70 Portland Cement Concrete Pavement
Specifications of the State Department of Highways.
      (6)   Curbs and gutters.  
         A.   The requirements of curbs and gutters will vary in accordance
with the character of the area and the density of development involved. In
urban or suburban areas, curbs are necessary to control storm water runoff and
to clearly define driving and parking areas.
         B.   Curbs shall be required on all streets designed to serve areas
where the existing or anticipated net residential density of the area
surrounding the proposed subdivision equals or exceeds three families per net
acre.
         C.   Where residential lot frontages are less than eighty-five feet in
commercial developments or where other similar intensive urban uses exist or
are anticipated, curbs shall ordinarily be required. The installation of curbs
may be required on major or minor highways if such construction is deemed
necessary for public safety.
         D.   Where curbs exist on abutting properties, their extension will
ordinarily be required throughout the proposed subdivison.
         E.   When curbs are not required, adequate gutters shall be graded and
protected by seeding or appropriate surfacing.
         F.   Curbs may be of the wall type or may be combined with gutters
built of concrete. Curbs, combined curbs, gutters and graded gutters shall be
constructed in conformance with the current construction and material
specifications of the State Department of Highways as they pertain to this type
of improvement.
      (7)   Driveways. 
         A.   The maximum grade on driveways shall not exceed ten percent
(10%). Driveway pipe shall be concrete pipe except that, other than for the
gutter, it may be extra-vitrified pipe or equal, with a minimum diameter of
twelve inches and a minimum length of twenty feet.
         B.   The subdivider or developer shall place approved drainage
structures under intersecting roads, drives, lanes or property entrances and at
other locations where required.
   (e)   Utilities and Other Improvements. Electrical service, gas mains and
other utilities shall be provided within each subdivision. Whenever such
facilities are reasonably accessible and available, they may be required to be
installed within the area as required. Trees may be planted along the streets
outside the right of way.
   (f)   Sidewalks. Concrete sidewalks having a minimum width of four feet and
having a minimum thickness of four inches shall be installed on both sides of
all new streets, provided, however, that the Planning Commission may waive this
requirement and allow sidewalks along only one side of any new street where in
its sole and absolute discretion it determines that sidewalks on both sides of
such new street are not necessary.
   (g)   Street Name Signs. Street name signs, of a type similar to those in
use throughout the Municipality, shall be erected by the Municipality at all
intersections.
   (h)   Street Lighting. Plans for street lights, if any, shall be submitted
to the Municipal Engineer for approval.
   (i)   Trench Backfilling. All trenches for water lines, sewers and utilities
within the pavement or driveway areas shall be backfilled with granular
material to a point within a minimum of six inches of the subgrade and to a
point three feet outside the pavement edge or three feet back of the curb, if a
curb is used.
   (j)   Improvements Bond. The improvements and standards therefor described
in Section
1117.03 and this section have been adopted by Council, and no final subdivision
shall be approved unless the improvements listed in the sections of these
Regulations have been satisfactorily completed prior to such approval or the
subdivider shall file with the Service Director a surety bond, cashier's or
certified check for the estimated amount of the construction cost which shall
be approved by the Municipal Engineer and Utility Department, guaranteeing to
the Municipality that such improvements will be constructed and completed in a
satisfactory manner and within a period specified by the Municipal Engineer.
Such period shall not exceed one year beyond completion. The bond or checks
shall be approved by the Law Director and shall be made payable to and
enforceable by the Municipality. Upon satisfactory completion of the
improvements and approval of the same in writing by the Municipal Engineer, and
with the presentation of letters of certification of payment in full of all
contractors, subcontractors, suppliers of materials, engineers, surveyors and
all inspection fees or other fees incurred by the installation of the
improvements by the subdivider, the bonds may be released in writing by the
Clerk of the Municipality or the cashier's or certified check may be returned
to the developer.
   (k)   Provisions for Maintenance and Operation. Where the subdivision
contains sewers, sewage treatment plants, water supply systems, park areas,
street trees or other physical facilities necessary or desirable for the
welfare of the area and which are of common use or benefit and which are of
such character that the Municipality or other public agency does not desire to
maintain them, provisions shall be made by trust agreements, which are a part
of the deed restrictions and which are acceptable to the Planning Commission,
for the proper and continuous maintenance and supervision of such facilities by
the lot owners in the subdivision.

1125.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   The Municipal officials concerned with property development shall take
into account that it is increasingly difficult to forecast the various
conditions and factors that may be encountered in sizable developments, and
that certain latitude, flexibility, and freedom in the execution of the design
and layout of a project shall be suggested or otherwise permitted by the
Municipality so as to encourage the developer to adjust the streets to
irregular topography; to take advantage of topography in order to utilize the
natural surface drainage; to economize in the construction of sewers and storm
drainage facilities; to reduce the amount of grading and thus minimize
destruction of trees and topsoil; to adjust the layout to geographical and
cultural limitations such as property ownership lines; and, among other things,
to create architectural variation in the development as well as attractive and
usable buildings and building sites; and further, such developments shall be
designed so as to enhance the community or neighborhood in general by providing
amenities which are unique to the area.
   (b)   Planned unit developments may be residential, commercial or industrial
developments, or they may be combinations of uses, such as residential and
commercial, or commercial and industrial. The minimum site area for a
residential development shall be ten acres; for a mobile home park, five acres;
for a commercial development, five acres; and for an industrial development,
fifteen acres. If a combination of uses is proposed, a residential-commercial
development shall have a minimum of twenty acres and a commercial-industrial
development shall have a minimum of twenty acres. In combination developments,
the amount of land devoted to commercial usage shall not exceed twenty percent
(20%) of the total land area of the development.
   (c)   Plans for a planned unit development shall be submitted to the
Planning Commission for study and approval, in accordance with the procedures
prescribed in Chapter
1109 of these Subdivision Regulations.
(Ord. 1389. Passed 1-10-80.)
1125.02 REQUIRED PLANS AND ACTIONS BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)   In order for the Commission to better determine that the planned unit
development meets all requirements, the developer shall furnish a preliminary
plan of the entire tract showing topography, roads, lot lines, lot areas,
easements, encumbrances, and other relevant data. The plans shall include the
location of existing structures, areas of shrubs and trees of a ten-inch
diameter or more, existing contours and the proposed grading plan.
   (b)   Upon determination by the Commission that the proposed planned unit
development project as shown by the preliminary plan conforms to the
requirements of all applicable provisions of these Regulations, the proponent
shall prepare and submit a final development plan, and such plan shall
incorporate any changes or modifications required by the Commission.
   (c)   Upon approval by the Commission, the plans shall be submitted to
Council for consideration and action. The approval and recommendations of the
Commission shall be based on the following general conditions:
      (1)   The plan is consistent with the intent and purpose of these
Regulations to promote public health, safety, morals and general welfare.
      (2)   The use of the land shall be similar to the uses permitted in the
district in which the plan is located.
         (Ord. 1389. Passed 1-10-80.)
1125.03 ACCEPTANCE BY ACTION OF COUNCIL.
   (a)   Following its review of the plans for the planned unit development,
Council may suggest modifictions in the plan consistent with the intent and
meaning of these Regulations prior to approval.
   (b)   After the final development plan has been approved by Council and in
carrying out this plan, adjustment or rearragements of buildings, parking
areas, entrances, heights or yards may be requested by the proponents, and
provided such requests conform to the standards established by the final
development plan and these Regulations, such adjustment or arrangements may be
authorized by the Commission.
(Ord. 1389. Passed 1-10-80.)
1125.04 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   Planned unit developments shall be encouraged, but they shall conform to the
requirements of Chapters
1117,
1121 and
1125 of these Regulations.
   (a)   Residential Development. A planned unit development may be permitted
as follows:
      (1)   The lot area per family as specified in Chapter
1113 may be reduced, but such reduction shall not exceed twenty percent (20%).
      (2)   Sixty percent (60%) of the lot area reduction or not less than ten
percent (10%) of the total project area shall be devoted to open space and
recreational facilities for the residents of the area being developed. Such
open space land or recreatioal facilities shall be held in corporate ownership
by the owners of the project area building sites, and the developer shall
incorporate into the protective covenants and/or deed restrictions, a clause
giving an interest in such land to each owner who buys property within the
development. As an alternate to a property owners' association, the developer
may deed the land to a public agency, which shall maintain the open space in
lieu of a property owners' association.
      (3)   In no case shall the density of families per net residential acre
in the project be greater than twelve percent (12%) more than that which would
be permitted by the lot requirements of Chapter
1113.
      (4)   The lot widths may be reduced not to exceed a ten percent (10%)
reduction of the requirements of Chapter
1117.
      (5)   The lot widths may be varied due to the variety of structural
designs and it is recommended that setbacks may be varied. If lot widths for
single-family or two-family residential lots are varied by the developer, he
shall enter into an agreement with the County that the property owners within a
planned unit development of this nature shall be assessed equally for any
improvements which may be by assessment, rather than by a front footage basis.
      (6)   Every property shall be designed to abut upon the open space or
recreation facilities required in subsection (b)(2) of this section.
      (7)   Commercial uses normally included in a neighborhood business
district may be included in a planned unit development provided they form a
small commercial center to primarily serve the planned unit development and
vicinity.
   (b)   Commercial Development.
      (1)   A planned unit development for commercial establishments may be
permitted in accordance with the following provisions, if the Commission is
satisfied:
         A.   That the proponents of the development are financially able to
carry out the proposed project;
         B.   That they intend to start construction within one year of the
approval of the project;
         C.   That they intend to complete it within a reasonable time as
determined by the Commission; and
         D.   That the need for the proposed development has been demonstrated
by means of market studies and such other evidence as the Commission may
require.
      (2)   Commercial buildings and establishments shall be planned as groups
having common parking areas and common ingress and egress points in order to
reduce the number of potential accident locations at intersections with
thoroughfares. In planning these groups of buildings or establishments, no yard
space will be required between uses within the groups; however, appropriate
yard must be provided at the edge of the complete development. Planting screens
or fences shall be provided on the sides of the development abutting areas
occupied or likely to be occupied by residences.
      (3)   Off-street parking and loading space shall be provided. Group
parking facilities shall provide spaces equal to the number of spaces required
for each use to be developed.
      (4)   The plan of the project shall provide for the integrated and
harmonious design of buildings, and for adequate and properly arranged
facilities for internal traffic circulation, landscaping, and such other
features and facilties as may be necessary to make the project attractive and
efficient from the standpoint of the developer as well as from the standpoint
of the adjoining and surrounding existing or potential developments.
      (5)   The ground area occupied by all the buildings shall not exceed in
the aggregate twenty-four percent (24%) of the total area of the lot or tract.
   (c)   Industrial Development. A planned unit development for industrial uses
may be permitted in accordance with the following provisions:
      (1)   Industrial uses and parcels shall be developed in parklike
surroundings utilizing landscaping and existing woodlands as buffers to screen
lighting, parking areas, loading areas or docks and/or outdoor storage of raw
materials or products. A planned industrial area shall provide for the harmony
of buildings and a compact grouping or groupings in order to economize in the
provision of such utility services as are required. Thoroughfares shall be kept
to a minimum throughout a planned industrial area in order that those
thoroughfares which are constructed may be built to the highest possible
standards.
      (2)   Certain types of commercial uses, such as a restaurant, central
secretarial or stenographic pool, or other business service type uses, repair
services, or clinics as may form a small commercial center to serve the needs
of the industries or their personnel, may be permitted in a planned industrial
area.
      (3)   Off-street parking and loading areas shall be provided with
sufficient spaces to meet all anticipated needs. Loading and open storage areas
shall be screened by walls, fences, or plantings wherever visible from
residential areas or public streets and highways.
      (4)   No buildings shall be less than seventy-five feet from any boundary
of the tract on which the office, research, or industrial development is
located. All intervening spaces between the street pavement and the right-of-
way line, and intervening spaces between buildings, drives, parking areas and
improved areas shall be landscaped with trees and plantings and be properly
maintained at all times.

1141.145 FENCE REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Purpose. Fence regulations are established in order to protect the
public health, safety and general welfare by establishing regulations
controlling the use of fences, in order to ensure property owners of privacy,
security, and personal preference in landscape design within their properties,
with consideration of the surrounding environment, the appearance of the
community as a whole, and the safety of the public and the individual.
   (b)   Definitions. As used in these regulations:
      (1)   "Fence" means any structure composed of wood, metal, stone, brick
or other material directed in such a manner and location so as to enclose,
partially enclose or divide any premises or part of premises for the purpose of
confinement, screening, partition, or decoration.
      (2)   "Privacy fence" means a fence made to inhibit public view and
provide seclusion.
      (3)   "Ornamental fence" means a fence usually made of wood construed for
its beauty or decorative effect.
      (4)   "Chain link fence" means a fence usually made of metal consisting
of loops or wire interconnected by a series of joined links.
      (5)   "Barb wire fence" means a fence made with metal wire having sharp
points or barbs along its length.
   (c)   Application. The provisions of these fence regulations apply to any
zoning district, except where expressly provided herein.
   (d)   Fence Standards for All Districts.
      (1)   Permit and Inspection Required.  No fence shall be constructed
prior to the issuance of a permit by the City Service Director. Applications
for permit shall include plans or drawings having the actual and accurate shape
and dimensions of the property on which the fence is to be built; the exact
height, location, length, type of material, color, and type of construction of
proposed fence; the location of all buildings on the lot; or any other
information deemed necessary by the City Service Director. The City Service
Director shall review each application to determine its compliance with the
provisions of these regulations. Each property owner shall determine property
lines and verify that the proposed fence does not encroach upon another lot or
parcel of land. The issuance of a permit by the City Service Director shall not
be construed to mean the City of Uhrichsville has determined the fence is not
encroaching upon another lot, nor shall it relieve the property owner of the
duty imposed herein.
      (2)   Materials, Maintenance and Repair. Approved fencing and wall
material include wood, metal, vinyl material, synthetic look-a-like products or
other materials. Chain link fences shall be permitted for use on single family
lots if they are located in the side or rear yard and approved by the City
Service Director. The smooth finished side of the fence shall be the side of
the fence that faces outward from the yard being fenced. All the framing or
support members shall face the property owner (inward). Fences and walls shall
be maintained in good repair, be structurally sound, and be attractively
finished at all times by the owner of the lot on which such fences are located.
      (3)   Height and Location. The permitted height of a fence shall be
determined by its location on the property as follows:
         A.   Front yards. Ornamental fences only may be erected in front
yards. Examples of permitted ornamental fences are picket fences, split rail
fences, wrought iron fences, and other fences approved by the City Service
Director. The fence must be parallel to the building line, to a height not
exceeding four (4) feet six (6) inches. The fence must be located at least two
(2) feet off of the sidewalk. Chain link and privacy fences are not permitted
in front yards. Such front yard fences may not be any closer than two (2) feet
off of the front and side property lines.
         B.   Side and rear years.
            i)    Ornamental fences may be erected in side and rear yards
parallel with a common property line or street right-of-way area, to a height
not to exceed six (6) feet.
            ii)    Chain link fences subject to the standards set for herein
shall be permitted in side and rear yards parallel to a common property line or
street right-of-way area, to a height not to exceed six (6) feet.
            iii)   Privacy fences shall be permitted in rear and side yards
only. The permitted height of privacy fences in side yards is as follows: (1)
No more than six (6) feet in height for the section of privacy fence running
from the front corner of the residential structure to the rear of the parcel;
and (2) No more than four (4) feet six (6) inches for the section of the
privacy fence running from the front corner of the residential structure to the
front of the parcel.
            iv)    Side and rear yard fences must be a minimum of two (2) feet
off of the property line of street right-of-way area.
         C.   Comer lot. Where a rear or side yard abuts a street, privacy
fences otherwise permitted in a side or rear yard shall not extend into side or
rear yards on the street side, absent prior approval of the City Service
Director. However, this provision shall not prohibit permitted rail or split
rail fence to be erected in such side or rear yards parallel to and not nearer
than two (2) feet from the side or rear property line, height not to exceed
four (4) feet, six (6) inches.
      (4)   Uniform Design. All fences on a single parcel shall have a unified
style for all fence segments visible from off the premises for any single
direction, unless otherwise specifically approved by the City Service Director.
      (5)   Location in regard to Sidewalks. Fences are prohibited to extend
further than the existing sidewalk. If no sidewalk exists, the property owner
may be required to set back the fence far enough to allow the installation of a
sidewalk in the future, if deemed necessary in the discretion of the City
Service Director.
      (6)   Similar Character Fences. The City Service Director may permit
other fences which are similar in character and design to one or more of the
fences permitted herein.
      (7)   Prohibited Fences. Unless provided for elsewhere herein, the
following fences are prohibited:
         A.   Above-ground electrified fences, barbed wire, razor wire, or
sharp-edged fences;
         B.   Snow fencing or construction fencing, except during appropriate
weather and construction conditions; and
         C.   Welded wire fencing.
   (e)   Appeal. Should the City Service Director fail or refuse to issue a
permit after proper application has been made thereof, a property owner may
appeal the failure or refusal to the City Board of Zoning Appeals. The City
Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to approve applications upon
appeal and the power to permit variances after hearing, in accordance with the
established rules of the City Board of Zoning Appeals. The power to grant
variances to these fence regulations shall include, but are not limited to, the
authority to grant variances with respect to prohibited fences. A property
owner seeking a variance with the City Board of Zoning Appeals shall follow all
the rules and procedures currently in force for the granting of variances
regarding the City Zoning Code.
   (f)   Fee. A property owner desiring to build or install a fence in the City
shall pay an application fee as prescribed by City Council.
   (g)   Non-conforming Fences. Fences existing as of the date of enactment of
these fence regulations shall be allowed to remain. However, the replacement of
non-conforming fences is strictly prohibited. (Ord. 11-20. Passed 7-23-20.)
1141.15 REMOVAL OF SOIL, SAND OR OTHER MATERIAL.
   The use of land for the removal of top soil, sand or other material from the
land other than materials from basement excavations is not permitted in any
zone except under a temporary permit from the Board of Zoning Appeals; this
permit may be denied or issued in appropriate cases after the filing of an
application accompanied by a suitable agreement or bond that such removal will
not cause stagnant water to collect or leave the surface of the land, at the
expiration of such permit, in an unstable condition, or unfit for the growing
of turf or for other land uses permitted in the district in which such removal
occurs.
(Ord. 13-12. Passed 8-9-12.)
1141.16 RESIDENTIAL SERVICES.
   Essential services shall be allowed in any district insofar as permitted,
authorized, or regulated by law or other essential service may be permitted in
any district when approved by the Planning Commission. In granting such
permission, the Planning Commission shall take into consideration the location,
size, use and effect such building will have on the adjacent land and
buildings.
(Ord. 13-12. Passed 8-9-12.)
1141.17 EXTERNAL EFFECTS.

any manner so as to create any dangerous, injurious, noxious or otherwise
objectionable fire, explosive, or other hazard; noise, brilliant light,
vibration; smoke, dust, fumes, odor or other form of air pollution; heat, cold,
dampness, electrical or electronic disturbances, nuclear radiation, or any
other condition, substance or element as per applicable federal standards to
any person or property outside of the premises on which such building,
structure or use is located; such uses when lawfully permitted under the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance shall be operated in a manner so as to
insure that the property rights of all other parcels of land will not be
adversely affected to the extent of reducing the enjoyment of property rights
thereon.
(Ord. 13-12. Passed 8-9-12.)
1141.18 OUTDOOR STORAGE AND WASTE DISPOSAL.
   Every use shall be operated in accord with the following provisions:
   (a)   No highly flammable or explosive liquids, solids or gases shall be
stored in bulk above ground except in an industrial district. Tanks or drums of
fuel directly connected with heating devices or appliances located on the same
lot as the tanks or drums of fuel are excluded from this provision;
   (b)   All outdoor storage facilities for fuel, raw materials and products
shall be enclosed by a fence, wall or planting to conceal such facilities from
adjacent residential property;
   (c)   No materials or wastes shall be deposited upon a lot in such form or
manner that they may be transferred off the lot by wind, flood or natural
causes or forces;
   (d)   All materials or wastes which might cause fumes, dust or which
constitute a fire hazard or which may be edible or attractive to rodents or
insects shall be stored outdoors only in closed containers constructed of
impervious material.

project into a required front yard; however, may extend from the dwelling into
the required front yard.
   (c)   No structure may project into a required side yard except that, where
a single lot under one ownership existed in a residential district at the time
of passage of this Zoning Ordinance, and such lot is of insufficient width to
meet the side yard requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may grant a minimum variance to permit the construction of a one-family
residence.
(Ord. 13-12. Passed 8-9-12.)

exceeding ninety (90) feet when the required side and rear yards are each
increased by one (1) foot for each foot of additional building height above the
height regulations for the district in which the building is located, provided,
however, that prior to the issuance of a zoning permit for any structure which
is planned to exceed thirty-five (35) feet in height, the Planning Commission
shall make a finding that any such excessive height will not be detrimental to
the public safety; to the light, air or privacy of any other structure or use
currently existing or approved for construction.

   Within the districts established by this Zoning Ordinance or amendments that
may later be adopted, there exists lots, structures, and uses of land and
structures which were lawful before this Zoning Ordinance was passed or
amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms
of this Zoning Ordinance or future amendment. It is the intent of this Zoning
Ordinance to permit these non-conformities to continue until they are removed
but not to encourage their continuance. Such uses are declared by this Zoning
Ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved.
   It is further the intent of this Zoning Ordinance that non-conformities
shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for
adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district
except by appeal to the Board of Zoning appeals for approval of specific plans.
Expansions of existing non-conforming uses, where allowed by the Board of
Zoning Appeals, may be made only on property owned by the applicant as of the
effective date of this Zoning Ordinance.
   A non-conforming use of a structure, a non-conforming use of land, or a non-
conforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged after
passage of this Zoning Ordinance by attachment on a building or premises of
additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition
of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district
involved.
   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance and upon which actual building
construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position
and fastened in a permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of
an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding
such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided
that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building
involved.
   (a)   Non-conforming Lots of Record: In any district in which single-family
dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding other limitations imposed by other
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, a single-family dwelling and customary
accessory building may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective

continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, and if all or part of the lots do not meet
the requirements for lot width and area as established by this Zoning
Ordinance, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for
the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance, and no portion of said parcel shall be
used or sold which does not meet lot width and area requirements established by
this Zoning Ordinance, nor shall any division of the parcel be made which
leaves remaining any lot with width or area below the requirements stated in
this ordinance.
   (b)   Non-conforming Uses of Land: Where at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, lawful use of land exists that is made
no longer permissible under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance as enacted or
amended, such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   No such non-conforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, except as provided.
      (2)   No such non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to
any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance.
      (3)   If any such non-conforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than twelve (12) months, any subsequent use of such land shall
conform to the regulations specified by this Zoning Ordinance for the district
in which such land is located.
      (4)   Where a non-conforming use of the land by the nature of the use
requires expansion or enlargement of the land area so used in order to continue
in operation such as removal of sand, earth, stone, minerals, etc., continuance
of such operations following the adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance
shall be deemed a violation.
   (c)   Non-conforming Structures: Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance that could not
be built under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance by reasons of restrictions on
area, lot coverage, height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or
its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful.
   (d)   Non-conforming Uses of Structures: If a lawful use of a structure or
of structure and premises in combination exists at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, the lawful use may be continued
so long as it remains otherwise awful, subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   If no structural alterations are made, any non-conforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another non-conforming
use provided that the Board of Zoning appeals, either by general rule or by
making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is
equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing non-
conforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of Zoning Appeals in
collaboration with the Planning Commission may require appropriate conditions
and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a non-conforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located and the
non-conforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
      (3)   When a non-conforming use of a structure, or structure and premises
in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for twelve (12) consecutive
months, the structure or structure and premises in combination shall not
thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district
in which it is located.
      (4)   When non-conforming use status applies to a structure and premises
in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall result in uses
only permitted in the district in which it is located.
   (e)   Repairs and Maintenance: On any building devoted in whole or in part
to any non-conforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs or on repairs
or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing.   
   (f)   Restoring Buildings: When a building or structure, the use of which
does not conform to the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, has been damaged
by explosion, fire, act of god, or the public enemy, to the extent of twice its
assessed value for tax purposes, it shall not be restored or reconstructed or
in any way used except in conformity with the district regulations of the
district in which the building is situated. When a non-conforming use qualifies
for such reconstruction, a building permit shall be secured for that purpose
within one (1) year from the date of occurrence for that damage and such
reconstruction shall be diligently prosecuted and completed without delay.
Failure to comply as set forth above shall cause such non-conforming uses to
lapse and the premises shall conform thereafter to the established district
regulations therein.
   (g)   Violations Not Rendered Non-conforming: A use, structure or lot which
was in violation of the provisions of the Ordinance which this Zoning Ordinance
amends shall not be validated or become non-conforming upon the adoption of
this Zoning Ordinance.
Nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening

   The Board shall follow the guidelines outlined hereinbelow in reviewing
plans for changes or alterations to historic structures and for sites in the
project area. The Board shall be lenient in it judgment of plans for structures
of little value or for plans involving new construction, unless such plans
would seriously impair the historic or architectural value of surrounding
structures of the surrounding area.
   (a)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for
a property which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or site
and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended purpose.
   (b)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features shall
be avoided when possible.
   (c)   All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of
their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
   (d)   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence
of the history and development of a building, structure or site and its
environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right,
and this significance shall be recognized and respected.
   (e)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterized a building, structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
   (f)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever and whenever possible. In the event replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in
composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or
replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate
duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial
evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different
architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
   (g)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that damage
the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
   (h)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archeological resources affected by, or adjacent to any project.
   (i)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
property, neighborhood or environment.
   (j)   Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be
done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations to structures were
to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure
would be unimpaired.
      (Ord. 13-22. Passed 10-13-22.)
1167.08  CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   The Board shall issue a written recommendation in the form of a
"Certificate of Appropriateness" for all projects it reviews. Issuance of such
a recommendation shall be by affirmative vote of three (3) members of the Board
present and voting. The Certificate of Appropriateness will be issued and filed
with the City Service Director by the Board.
   (b)   In making its recommendation and issuing a Certificate of
Appropriateness, the Board shall consider whether the proposed change will
affect adversely or destroy any significant historic or architectural feature
of the structure, whether it is inappropriate or inconsistent with the spirit
and purpose of this Policy and whether it will affect adversely or destroy the
general historic and architectural significance of the area in question. With
respect to proposed demolition, the Board shall determine whether preservation
or rehabilitation is economically feasible, or shall make its recommendation in
consideration of practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship that would
deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or building involved.
The Board's recommendation may advise the applicant of any changes necessary,
in the Board's opinion, to comply with this Policy.

   Before any zoning permit is issued affecting land within three hundred (300)
feet of the centerline of a proposed new highway or a highway for which changes
are proposed or any land within a radius of five hundred (500) feet from the
point of intersection of said centerline with any public road or highway, the
Zoning Inspector shall give notice to the applicant that a zoning permit will
not be issued until after a recommendation is made in a period of thirty (30)
days from the date notice is received by the Uhrichsville Planning Commission.
After having checked the Comprehensive Plan, the Uhrichsville Planning
Commission may coordinate with the Tuscarawas County Regional Planning
Commission, Ohio Department of Transportation, Tuscarawas County Engineer's
Office or any other such entity or agency that is or may be involved in
transportation planning so as to ascertain whether or not highway construction
or changes are planned. If the Uhrichsville Planning Commission is notified by
any of the above agencies of pending plans for said highway, they shall
recommend against the issuance of a zoning permit and shall attempt to resolve
any conflict within thirty (30) days. If no plans exist for said highway, or on
the expiration of the thirty (30) days, the Zoning Inspector shall, issue the
zoning permit/zoning compliance certificate if the application is in

require approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be issued by the Zoning
Inspector and the appropriate fee(s) paid by the applicant within thirty (30)
days of the date of board approval. Failure to do so will result in the
doubling of any permit fees for each thirty (30) day period beyond the initial
thirty (30) days following Board approval up to one hundred and eighty (180)
days after which the permit may be revoked and a new approval required by the
appropriate board. Re-application for variances shall be in conformance with
Section
1173.17. All zoning permits shall, however, be conditional upon the
commencement of work within one (1) year from date of issuance. The copy of the
plans may be placed in the official file. The Zoning Inspector may issue a

provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.

the Zoning Inspector to the persons affected, together with notice that further
work as described in the cancelled permit shall not proceed unless and until a

reason of facts stated in the application, a stay would, in his opinion, cause
imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be
stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board of
Zoning Appeals or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Zoning
Inspector from whom the appeal is taken on due cause shown.

1173.13 PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR VARIANCES.
   To vary the strict application of any of the requirements of this Zoning
Ordinance in the case of exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow or deep lots,
or other exceptional physical conditions, whereby such strict application would
result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship - not economic in nature
- that would deprive the owner of reasonable use of the land or building
involved but in no other case. The fact that another use would be more
profitable is not a valid basis for legally granting a variance. No
nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same
district, and no permitted use of lands, structures or buildings in other
districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance. The
variance requested shall not alter the essential character of the locality, nor
be in conflict with the Comprehensive Master Plan. In making this
determination, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be advised by the
recommendation of the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 13-12. Passed 8-9-12.)
1173.13.1 PROCEDURE FOR CONSIDERATION OF PETITIONS FOR VARIANCE.
   The procedure for the consideration of petitions for variances shall be:
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall make a finding that the reasons set
forth in the application are valid and justify the granting of the variance.
The Board shall also determine if the variance is the minimum variance that
will make possible the reasonable use of land, building or structure.
   (b)   Under no circumstances shall the Board of Zoning Appeals grant a
variance which will permit a use which is not permitted in the district
involved.
   (c)   Conditions: The Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning Ordinance and the
recommendation of the Planning Commission. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall
require a bond or irrevocable letter of credit to assure conformance to such
conditions and safeguards as the Board may require.
   (d)   Violation of such conditions and safeguards when such are made a part
of the terms under which a variance is granted, shall cause the bond mentioned
in
1173.13.1(c) above to be forfeited and shall be deemed in violation of this
Zoning Ordinance and punishable under Section
1169.99 of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (e)   Public Hearings: Prior to taking action on a request for a variance
the Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public hearing and give notice to
property owners as required in Section
1173.09 of this Zoning Ordinance.
      (Ord. 13-12. Passed 8-9-12.)
1173.13.2 APPLICATION AND STANDARDS FOR VARIANCES.
   A variance from the terms of this Zoning Ordinance shall not be granted by
the Board of Zoning Appeals unless and until a written application for a
variance is submitted to the Zoning Inspector and the Board of Zoning Appeals
containing at a minimum:
   (a)   Name, address and phone number of applicants;
   (b)   Legal description of property; and a site plan based on an accurate
survey showing existing and/or future building locations and the locations of
buildings on adjacent properties. This site plan should be prepared by a
registered surveyor attesting to the accuracy of same;
   (c)   Description of nature of variance requested;
   (d)   Variances from the terms of the Zoning Ordinance shall be granted only
where the property owner shows that the application of a zoning requirement to
the property is inequitable causing the property owner practical difficulties
in the use of the property. Factors to consider include, but are not limited
to:
      (1)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
      (2)   Whether the variance is substantial;
      (3)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
      (4)   Whether the variance would adversely effect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sanitary sewer or garbage removal;
      (5)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restriction;
      (6)   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance; and
      (7)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance. The Board
shall determine, after weighing the factors described above and any other
factors the Board deems relevant, whether the property owner has shown
practical difficulties so inequitable as to justify granting a variance to the
property owner.
(Ord. 13-12. Passed 8-9-12.)
1173.13.3 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   In granting any appeal or variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning
Ordinance. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the
terms under which the appeal or variance is granted, shall be deemed a
violation of this Zoning Ordinance and punishable under Section
1169.99 of this Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 13-12. Passed 8-9-12.)
1173.14 PROCEDURE AND REQUIREMENTS FOR APPROVAL OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   It is recognized that an increasing number of new kinds of uses are
appearing daily, and that many of these and some other more conventional uses
possess characteristics of such unique and special nature relative to location,
design, size, method of operation, circulation, and public facilities that each
specific use must be considered individually. These specific uses that are
conditionally permitted under the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance shall
follow the procedures and requirements set forth in this Section.
(Ord. 13-12. Passed 8-9-12.)
1173.14.1 GENERAL.
   The following requirements shall be complied with prior to any approval or
denial of a conditional use permit by the Board of Zoning Appeals:
   (a)   A written application for a conditional use is submitted indicating
the section of this Zoning Ordinance under which the conditional use is sought
and stating the grounds on which it is requested per Section
1173.14.2.
   (b)   A public hearing shall be held as specified in Section
1173.09 of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall determine:
      (1)   That it has the authority to grant the request.
      (2)   That the granting of the conditional use will not adversely effect
the neighborhood in which the conditional use is to be located.
      (3)   That the conditional use is not one which is contrary to the

1197.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general
welfare of the citizens of the City, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually
oriented businesses within the City. The provisions of this chapter have
neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
content of any communicative material, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny
access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.
   (b)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made
available to the Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of
Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc, 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini
Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215
(1990); Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), City of Erie v.
Papis AmM., 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000), and on studies in other communities
including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; St.
Paul, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden
Grove, Califomia; Los Angeles, California, Whittier, California; Austin, Texas;
Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; Beaumont, Texas;
Dallas, Texas; Newport News, Virginia; Bellevue, Washington; New Your, New
York; and St. Croix county, Wisconsin; and also on findings from the report of
the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented
Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners
of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
      (2)   Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this
ordinance as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain
types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
      (4)   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which
creates unhealthy conditions.
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
      (6)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AID's),
genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and
shigella infections.
      (7)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United Stated. 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983,
4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in 1985, and 253,448 through December 31, 1992.
      (8)   As of 1999, there have been 44 deaths and 16,252 reported cases of
AIDS/HIV in the State of Ohio.
      (9)   Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing
cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in
Ohio.
      (10)   The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982
and 45,200 through November of 1990.
      (11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being
reported in 1990.
      (12)   The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986 has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      (13)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
      (14)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
      (15)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult"
oriented films.
      (16)   The findings noted in paragraphs (1) through (15) raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (17)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (18)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health,
safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the
City. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is
the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and
control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (19)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
      (20)   Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments.
      (21)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually
oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
      (22)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who
are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
      (23)   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been
convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the
applicant may engage in the conduct in contravention of this chapter.
      (24)   The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses
for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads
to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
      (25)   The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens for
the City will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

1325.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Uhrichsville, State of
Ohio, does ordain as follows.
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Uhrichsville has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Uhrichsville as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by the City of Uhrichsville.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
(Ord. 11-06. Passed 7-13-06.)

registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Uhrichsville as required by Section
1325.04(c), Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City Hall, 305 East 2nd Street, Uhrichsville, Ohio
44683.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Uhrichsville, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 11-06. Passed 7-13-06.)
1325.02 DEFINITIONS.

filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor. See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management). Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
    (k)   Flood or Flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
Zone A:    Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base
flood elevations are not determined.
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.

   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   Floodway A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and
the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.
LOMC's are broken down into the following categories:
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area
      Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
      Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).
A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies
with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management
criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps,
Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27- 01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Uhrichsville
Flood Insurance Rate Map, January 2, 1987, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect. A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer. A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor. A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of Construction. The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood related damage
sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten year period for
which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average,
equals or exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) of the market value to the
structure before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. When the combined total of all
previous improvements or repairs made during the life of the structure equals
or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of a structure's market value, that structure is
considered a substantial improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered “new
construction”;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 11-06. Passed 7-13-06.)

   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of Uhrichsville flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section
1325.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1325.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1) hereof, prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation, and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A
hereof.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor and may be
submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Uhrichsville have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Uhrichsville’s Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Uhrichsville's boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of
the City of Uhrichsville suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the City of Uhrichsville has assumed
or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1325.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1325.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in

actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible,
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. to 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, “Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique”
or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Uhrichsville specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1325.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
   (j)   Storage of Materials. Storage of materials or equipment not otherwise
prohibited in subsection (a)(2) shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation.
      (Ord. 11-06. Passed 7-13-06.)

action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within thirty days of the date of such notice and order, or other
official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the
mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's
decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be
filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the
Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent
information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the
Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map, description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty days after the receipt of an application
for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing; a
notice of such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general
circulation in the community at least ten days before the date of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing.
         A.   At such hearing, the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, and standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others.
            2.    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.    The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.    The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.    A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.    A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.    A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A.1. to 11.
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals Board may appeal such
decision to the Tuscarawas County Court of Common Pleas, as provided in Chapter
2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 11-06. Passed 7-13-06.)
