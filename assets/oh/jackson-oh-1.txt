   WHEREAS, the Council of the City of Jackson has had the matter of
codification and general revision of its ordinances before it for some time,
and
 
   WHEREAS, Council has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H.
Drane Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
 
    WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council,
 
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF JACKSON, COUNTY
OF JACKSON, STATE OF OHIO:
 
   Section 1. That the ordinances of the City of Jackson, Ohio, of a general
and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated into

hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of the City of Jackson,
Ohio.
 
   Section 2.  That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 4 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to March 29, 1976, which are inconsistent with any provision of
the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.
   (b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)    The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

containing a subsection with the words "Adopting Ordinance", at the end thereof
indicates that the section contains new matter ordained by this Adopting
Ordinance.

necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety
and welfare of the City of Jackson and its inhabitants, and~for the further
reason that there exists an imperative necessity for the earliest publication

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

         B.   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be

101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:

liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

(ORC 1.58)
101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

107.01 INTRODUCTION.
   It is the policy of the City that openness leads to a better informed
citizenry, which leads to better government and better public policy. It is the
policy of the City to strictly adhere to the State’s Public Records Act. All
exemptions to openness are to be construed in their narrowest sense and any
denial of public records in response to a valid request must be accompanied by
an explanation, including legal authority, as outlined in the Ohio Revised
Code. If the request is in writing, the explanation must also be in writing.
(Ord. 143-07. Passed 12-10-07.)
107.02 DEFINITIONS; ORGANIZATION.
   (a)   Definitions.  This office, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code,
defines records as including the following: any document - paper, electronic
(including, but not limited to, e-mail), or other format - that is created or
received by, or comes under the jurisdiction of a public office that documents
the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or
other activities of the office. All records of the City are public unless they
are specifically exempt from disclosure under the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)   Organization.
      (1)   It is the policy of the City that, as required by Ohio law, records
will be organized and maintained so that they are readily available for
inspection and copying (See Section
107.05 for the e-mail record policy). Record retention schedules are to be
updated regularly and posted prominently.
      (2)   All City departments are to immediately implement procedures to see
that records are organized and maintained in order that records may be readily
available for inspection and copying. Each department shall as quickly as
possible submit to the Mayor an outline of procedures setting forth how records
are being maintained within the department, and how records may be made readily
available for inspection and copying.
         (Ord. 143-07. Passed 12-10-07.)
107.03 RECORD REQUESTS.
   Each request for public records should be evaluated for a response using the
following guidelines:
   (a)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian must contact
the requester for clarification, and should assist the requester in revising
the request by informing the requester of the manner in which the office keeps
its records.
   (b)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing, and
does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record. It is the City’s general policy that this information
is not to be requested.
   (c)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours, with the exception of published holidays. Public records must
be made available for inspection promptly. Copies of public records must be
made available within a reasonable period of time. “Prompt” and “reasonable”
take into account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the
location where the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review
of the records requested.
   (d)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. If fewer than twenty pages of
copies are requested or if the records are readily available in an electronic
format that can be e-mailed or downloaded easily, these should be made as
quickly as the equipment allows.
   (e)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority. If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released. If there
are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation,
including legal authority. (Ord. 143-07. Passed 12-10-07.)
107.04 COSTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual cost of
making copies.
      (1)   The charge for paper copies is five cents (5¢) per page.
      (2)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is one
dollar ($1.00) per disc.
      (3)   There is no charge for documents e-mailed.
   (b)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. They will be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies.
(Ord. 143-07. Passed 12-10-07.)
107.05 E-MAIL.
   (a)   Generally. Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined
by the Ohio Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the
office. E-mail is to be treated in the same fashion as records in other formats
and should follow the same retention schedules.
   (b)   Public E-mail Accounts.
      (1)   Records in public e-mail accounts used to conduct public business
are subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of this office
are instructed to retain their e-mails that relate to public business.
      (2)   The records custodian is to treat the e-mails from public accounts
as records of the public office, filing them in the appropriate way, retaining
them per established schedules and making them available for inspection and
copying in accordance with the Public Records Act.
         (Ord. 143-07. Passed 12-10-07.)
107.06 FAILURE TO RESPOND TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST.
         The City recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of failure to
properly respond to a public records request. In addition to the distrust in
government that failure to comply may cause, the failure to comply with a
request may result in a court ordering compliance with the law and to pay the
requester attorney’s fees and damages.

147.11 DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE POLICY.
   The City believes that every individual is entitled to a safe workplace. It
is well documented that the use or abuse of alcohol and other drugs is
potentially dangerous to the user, co-workers and the public, which we are
employed to serve.
   Therefore, the City has declared your work site to be a Drug-Free Workplace.
Please be advised that no person shall manufacture, distribute, dispense,
consume or possess alcohol or a controlled substance in your workplace. A
"controlled substance" means alcohol or any other drug whose general
availability is restricted; any one of a number of drugs or other substances
which are strictly regulated or outlawed because of the potential for abuse or
addiction. Any violation of this policy may be grounds for disciplinary action
in accordance with approved personnel policies. Copies of personnel policies
have been distributed to, and signed for by all City employees.
   While it is our sincere hope that no employee is suffering from a substance
problem, we are mandated by Public Law 100-690, Title V, Subtitle D, to inform
you that this policy will be enforced. We and your immediate supervisor are
concerned with your health and well-being.
   As an employee of the City, you are a key resource and a very important
person to us. In our efforts to serve City residents, we want to be able to
assist you in your personal and professional growth. That is why we are pleased
to be able to offer you a new program; the City of Jackson Employee Assistance
Program.
   We realize that personal problems such as stress, family crises, the abuse
of alcohol and other drugs and financial, legal and emotional difficulties can
affect the quality of life of our employees. We recognize that they may also
adversely affect your job performance. Since these personal problems can be
successfully resolved, we want you to know that services are available through
the City of Jackson Employees Assistance Program.
   We shall stress that this program is a voluntary program. It is not intended
to replace previously approved disciplinary policies. If you are in violation
of any personnel policies, you are subject to disciplinary procedures, but if
you voluntarily seek services related to the City of Jackson's Employee
Assistance Program, you can expect to be referred to an appropriate agency or
individual. All requests for information on services related to the City of
Jackson's Employee Assistance Program shall be kept confidential.
   You shall be invited to learn more about our Employee Assistance Program as
updates are made. We would also welcome suggestions from you on how this
Employee Assistance Program can best be of service.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF DRUG FREE WORKPLACE REQUIREMENTS.
I,                                          have been given and have read the
City of Jackson's
name of employee
policy on a Drug-Free Workplace.
   I have had the opportunity to ask questions relating to its content and
implementation.
I,                                             agree to abide by the terms of
the Drug-Free Workplace
name of employee
policy as a condition to my employment.
I,                                             agree to notify my employer of
any criminal statute

conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than five days
after such conviction.

(Ord. 12-78. Passed 3-13-78.)
160.04 PROCEDURES AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)    Any person subjected to an unlawful housing practice may file within
360 days of the alleged violation with the Human Rights Board a complaint in
writing, sworn to or affirmed, which shall state: the name and address of the
person aggrieved; the name and address of the person against whom the complaint
is filed; a description and the address of the dwelling, which involves the
alleged discriminatory housing practice or employment practice; a concise
statement of the facts, including pertinent dates, constituting the alleged
discriminatory housing or employment practice, and such other information as
may be required by the Board. The complaint may be reasonably and fairly
amended. The Board may also corroborate or initiate complaints on the basis of
studies carried out by its staff or volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (b)    Upon the filing of the complaint, the Secretary of the Board shall
make such investigations as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and issues.
Such investigation shall be conducted within fourteen business days after the
filing of the complaint. The investigation may be extended when deemed
necessary by the Chairman of the Board. If the Secretary shall determine that
there are reasonable grounds to believe a violation has occurred, he shall
attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of initial conference and
persuasion with all interested parties and such representatives as the parties
may choose to assist them. Conciliation conferences shall be informal and
nothing said or done during such initial conferences shall be made public by
any member of the Board or its staff unless the parties agree thereto in
writing.
   (c)    The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced
to writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the
parties, which agreement is for conciliation purposes and does not constitute
an admission by any parties that the law has been violated. Consent agreement
shall be signed on behalf of the Board by its Chairman.
   (d)    The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Commission, Ohio Civil Rights Commission, or the U. S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development and any other person or group regarding any
matters before the Board.
   (e)    If the Secretary determines that the complaint lacks reasonable
grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he shall so inform the
Board and the Board may in its discretion dismiss such complaint or order such
further investigation as may be necessary; provided, that the Board shall not
dismiss such complaint without first affording either party an opportunity to
appear before the Board.
   (f)    If the Secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a violation
of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or an informal consent agreement or determines that a complaint is
not susceptible of conciliation, he shall so notify the Board and the Board
shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a violation of
this chapter has been committed. The Board shall serve upon the respondent a
written statement of charges and a summons and shall serve upon all interested
parties a notice of the time and place of the hearing. The respondent or his
authorized counsel may file and amend such statements with the Board prior to
the hearing date as it deems necessary in support of its position. The hearing
shall be open to the public. The hearing shall be held not less than fifteen
calendar days nor more than thirty calendar days after service of the statement
of charges and summons. The summons so issued must be signed by two members of
the Board and the issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of
named persons and the production of relevant documents and records. The failure
to comply with a summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The
interested parties may, at their option, appear before the Board in person or
by a duly authorized representative and may have the assistance of an attorney.
The parties may present testimony in evidence and the right to cross- examine
witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony in evidence shall be given under
oath or by affirmation. The Secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing,
which records shall be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon
request by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such
party a copy of the hearing record, at such cost as the Board deems
appropriate.
   (g)   If, at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has
violated this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Law
Director, in executive session, state its findings to and call the Law Director
to prepare and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person
complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take
such affirmative action as will effectuate the purpose of this chapter, with
notice that if the Board upon investigation by the Secretary determines that
the person complained against has not after fifteen calendar days following
service of the Board's order complied with the order, the Board will recertify
the matter to the Law Director for enforcement. The Law Director shall seek
compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the Human Rights
Board of the City of Jackson before a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (h)    If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained
against has not violated this chapter, the Board shall so state and publish its
findings and issue its order dismissing the complaint. (Ord. 12- 78. Passed 3-

191.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter the following words and phrases shall have the
following meanings ascribed to them respectively.
   (a)    "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered for a consideration to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for
the accommodation of guests, whether the rooms are in one or several
structures.
   (b)    "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession of any room or rooms, or space or portion thereof, in any hotel for
dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or right to use
or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office space, banquet
or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display space shall not be
considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition, unless the person
exercising occupancy uses or possesses, or has the right to use or possess, all
or any portion of the room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes.
   (c)    "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether
in the capacity of owner, lessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any
other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing
agent of any type or character, other than an employee, the managing agent
shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall
have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the
provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall,
however, be considered to be compliance by both.
   (d)    "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,
association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any
other group or combination acting as a unit.
   (e)    "Rent" means the consideration received for occupancy valued in
money, whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash,
credits and property or services of any kind or nature, and also any amount for
which the occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever.
   (f)    "Transient guest" means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.
   (g)    "Treasurer" means the City Treasurer of the City of Jackson.
      (Ord. 23-88. Passed 3-14-88.)
191.02 RATE OF TAX.
   (a)    For the purpose of providing revenue with which to meet the needs of
the City for general operating expenses, there is levied a tax of six percent
(6%) on all rents received by a hotel for lodging furnished to transient
guests.
   (b)    This tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient guest to the City,
which is extinguished only by payment to the operator as trustee for the City,
or to the City. The transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the
hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid
tax shall be due upon the transient guest ceasing to occupy space in the hotel.
If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the
Treasurer may require that the tax be paid directly to the Treasurer.
(Ord. 4-94. Passed 3-1-94.)
191.03 EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)    No tax shall be imposed under this chapter:
      (1)   Upon rents not within the taxing power of the City under the
Constitution or laws of Ohio or the United States;
      (2)    Upon rents paid by the State, or any of its political
subdivisions;
      (3)    Upon rents of five dollars ($5.00) a day or less.
   (b)    No exemption claimed under subsections (a)(l) or (2) hereof shall be
granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected, and,
under penalty of perjury, upon a form prescribed by the Treasurer. All claims
of exemption under subsection (a)(3) hereof shall be made in the manner
prescribed by the Treasurer.
(Ord. 23-88. Passed 3-14-88.)
191.04 TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (a)    The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from
the rent, and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy, or any bill or statement or charge made for an occupancy issued or
delivered by the operator, and the tax shall be paid by the occupant to the
operator as trustee for and on account of the City, and the operator shall be
liable for the collection thereof and for the tax.
   (b)    No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner,
whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part, thereof will be
assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent,
or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter
provided.
(Ord. 23-88. Passed 3-14-88.)
191.05 REGISTRATION.
   Within thirty days after the effective date of this chapter, or within
thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any

certificate", to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.
The certificate shall, among other things, state the following:
   (a)    The name of the operator;
   (b)   The address of the hotel;
   (c)    The date upon which the certificate was issued;

person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Transient
Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Treasurer for the purpose of
collecting from transient guests the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting the
tax to the Treasurer. This certificate does not constitute a permit."
      (Ord. 23-88. Passed 3-14-88.)
191.06 REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the
close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period
which may be established by the Treasurer, make a return to the Treasurer, on
forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received, and the amount
of tax collected for transient occupancies. All claims for exemption from the
tax filed by occupants with the operator during the reporting period shall be
filed with the report. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the
tax collected shall be remitted to the Treasurer. The Treasurer may establish
shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary
in order to insure collection of the tax, and he may require further
information in the return if the information is pertinent to the collection of
the tax. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business
for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall
be held in trust for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to
the Treasurer. All returns and payments submitted by each operator shall be
treated as confidential by the Treasurer, and shall not be released by him
except upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or to an officer or
agent of the United States, the State, the County, or the City, for official
use only.
(Ord. 23-88. Passed 3-14-88.)
191.07 PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
   (a)    Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this
chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to ten percent (10%)
of the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (b)    Fraud. If the Treasurer determines that the nonpayment of any
remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to twenty-
five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition
to the penalties stated in subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)    Interest. In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any operator
who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the
rate of one percent (1%) per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the
tax exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became
delinquent until paid.
   (d)    Penalties During Pendency of Hearing or Appeal. No penalty provided
under the terms of this chapter shall be imposed during the pendency of any
hearing provided for in Section
191.08 , nor during the pendency of any appeal to the Board of Review provided
for in Section 
191.09 .
   (e)    Abatement of Interest and Penalty. In cases where a return has been
filed in good faith, and an assessment has been paid within the time prescribed
by the Treasurer, the Treasurer may abate any charge of penalty or interest, or
both.
(Ord. 23-88. Passed 3-14-88.)
191.08 FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION OF TAX BY CITY
TREASURER.
   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect the tax and to make, within
the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax, or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Treasurer shall proceed in such
manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his
estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Treasurer shall procure such facts and
information upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this
chapter, and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the
same and to make a report and remittance he shall proceed to determine and
assess against the operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by
this chapter. In case such determination is made, the Treasurer shall give
notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally, or by depositing it
in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so
assessed at his last known place of address. The operator may within ten days
after the serving or mailing of the notice make application in writing to the
Treasurer for a hearing on the amount assessed. If an application by the
operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax,
interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Treasurer, shall become final
and conclusive, and immediately due and payable. If an application is made, the
Treasurer shall give not less than five days written notice in the manner
prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in
the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for the tax,
interest and penalties.
   At the hearing the operator may appear and offer evidence why the specified
tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After the hearing, the
Treasurer shall determine the proper tax to be remitted, and shall give written
notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of the determination and
the amount of the tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due
shall be payable after fifteen days, unless an appeal is taken as provided in
Section
191.09. (Ord. 23-88. Passed 3-14-88.)
191.09 APPEAL.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Treasurer with respect to the
amount of the tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the Board of
Review by filing a notice of appeal with the Treasurer within fifteen days of
the serving or mailing of the determination of the tax due. The Board of Review
shall fix a time and place for hearing the appeal, and shall give notice in
writing to the operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the
Board of Review shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed
above for service of a notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be
immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.
(Ord. 23-88. Passed 3-14-88.)
191.10 BOARD OF REVIEW.
   (a)    A Board of Review, consisting of a chairman and two other individuals
each to be appointed by the Mayor of the City and approved by Council, is
hereby created. The Board shall adopt its own procedural rules and shall keep a
record of its transactions. Any hearings by the Board may be conducted
privately and the provisions of Section
191.06 hereof with reference to the confidential character of information
required to be disclosed by this chapter shall apply to such matters as may be
heard before the Board on appeal.
   (b)    The Board shall hear and pass on appeals from any ruling or decision
of the Treasurer, and at the request of the operator, person or Treasurer, is
empowered to substitute alternate methods of allocation. The Board shall, in
hearing, have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse or modify any such ruling or
decision, or any part thereof.
(Ord. 23-88. Passed 3-14-88.)
191.11 RECORDS.
   Every operator liable for the collection and payment to the City of any tax
imposed by this chapter shall keep and preserve, for a period of three years,
all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of tax as he may have
been liable for the collection of and payment to the City, which records the
Treasurer shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.
(Ord. 23-88. Passed 3-14-88.)
191.12 REFUNDS.
   (a)   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
subsections (b) and (c) hereof, provided a claim in writing therefor, stating,
under penalty of perjury, the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded,
is filed with the Treasurer within three years of the date of payment. The
claim shall be on forms furnished by the Treasurer.
   (b)   An operator may claim a refund or take as a credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Treasurer that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a transient guest; provided, however, that neither a refund
nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has
either been refunded to the transient guest or credited to rent subsequently
payable by the transient to the operator.
   (c)   A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid, or paid more
than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City, by
filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) hereof, but only when
the tax was paid by the transient guest directly to the Treasurer, or when the
transient guest, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the
satisfaction of the Treasurer that the transient guest has been unable to
obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.
   (d)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing

(Ord. 23-88. Passed 3-14-88.)

Ordinance that is not otherwise defined in this Ordinance is used in a
comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal

         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the City of Jackson in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399,
or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of the City of Jackson in any month of the
preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200.
Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made so that the
payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the
last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
         (c)    Intentionally left blank.
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City of Jackson. The payment
of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an
employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required
under this section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the City of Jackson as the
return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the
tax under this Ordinance is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the City of Jackson income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Ordinance or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the City of Jackson the tax withheld relieves the employee
from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure io remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
City of Jackson income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent
the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City of Jackson until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City of Jackson during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City of
Jackson income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees
and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Ordinance, to be tax required to be withheld and
remitted for the purposes of this section
Occasional Entrant - Withholding.

fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's

If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
      For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee
spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)

section, an employer is not required to withhold the City of Jackson income tax
on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal
services in the City of Jackson if the employee performed such services in the
City of Jackson on 20 or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the
following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the

worksite locations in the City of Jackson. For the purposes of this division,

services that can reasonably be, or would have been, expected by the employer
to last more than 20 days in a calendar year. Services can "reasonably be
expected by the employer to last more than 20 days" if either of the following
applies at the time the services commence:
               (a)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.

requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
 195.04.
            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
City of Jackson only if the employee spent more time performing services for or
on behalf of the employer in the City of Jackson than in any other municipal
corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an
employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more
of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the
employee's principal place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;

employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City of Jackson exceeds the 20-day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to the City of Jackson for any subsequent
days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in the City of Jackson.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City of
Jackson under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
the City of Jackson for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the employee for personal services performed in the City of Jackson.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the City of Jackson and the
employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
195.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
City of Jackson, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked
outside the corporate boundaries of the City of Jackson.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section

municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and,
with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to

income tax return. The extended due date of the City of Jackson's income tax
return shall be the 15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the
taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file under
this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax

the filing of the City of Jackson's income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month

extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's the City of Jackson income tax
return. If the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the
date the City of Jackson income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall
grant the taxpayer's requested extension.

the payment of the tax imposed by the City of Jackson, the Tax Administrator
may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as
provided in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file

does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the City of Jackson income tax
ordinance for a taxable year if both the following apply:

            (ii)    The person no longer provides services in the City and does
not expect to be subject to the City income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)    The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that

services or made any sales within the City of Jackson. The affidavit shall also
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the City of Jackson, make any sales in the City, or otherwise
become subject to the tax levied by the City during the taxable year. If the
affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the City for the taxable year,
the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a
taxpayer with the City income tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The
person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b) the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return
for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that

change.

an employer, or other payer as described in Section

imposed on the taxpayer by the City of Jackson, unless the amounts withheld
were not remitted to the City of Jackson and the recipient colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the City of Jackson to be filed in accordance
with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City of Jackson,
provided that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the City of Jackson or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer
or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the
provisions of this Ordinance and of the City of Jackson's ordinance,
resolution, or rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports,
or documents.

   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City of
Jackson's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The
election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-year period unless
the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under division (S)(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission
from the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request
for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a

(2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election is made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code
is terminated, valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code is
binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated the City of Jackson income tax rerum for that taxable year
if the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the City of Jackson. A taxpayer that is required
to file a consolidated the City of Jackson income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated the City of Jackson income tax return for all
subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer
has experienced a change in circumstances.

parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
195.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income”, appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's” for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's” appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated the City of Jackson income
tax return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
195.02 (C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated the City of Jackson income
tax return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through
entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
195.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Jackson. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
195.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Jackson. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
195.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Jackson;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City of Jackson
income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Ordinance on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated the City of Jackson income tax
return shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
195.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated the City of Jackson income tax
return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the City of Jackson in accordance with
this Ordinance on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation
is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of
such an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City of Jackson before July 1, 2018, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the City of Jackson may continue to
file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after July 1, 2018. (Ord. 61-17.

   (A)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the City of Jackson who is
required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this ordinance may
claim a nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the
other municipality. Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall

that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,

were actually withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the
dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the

including the application tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or
before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:

      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid

195.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
195.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date

division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the City of Jackson under Section
195.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City of Jackson
but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year
that includes the first day of the taxable year.

request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied.
   The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the
reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the

refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
195.21.

   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
195.18 (A)(4).

other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City of Jackson's tax rate. However, if the City of Jackson's tax rate is
greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of

   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period

figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
195.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund

dollars.

   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 61-17. Passed 12-18-17.)
195.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure
electronic mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a
new last known address, including the use of a change of address service
offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section
5703.056 of the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last
known address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered
served. If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after
the assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other the City of Jackson
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by the Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(l)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other the City of
Jackson official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this
division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by personal service.
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 61-17. Passed 12-18-17.)
195.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City of Jackson that arises pursuant to the City of Jackson's income tax
imposed in accordance with this Ordinance.
   (B)    Nothing in this Ordinance prohibits the Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the City of
Jackson:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 61-17. Passed 12-18-17.)
195.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Ordinance is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City of
Jackson as authorized by this Ordinance. The Tax Administrator or a designee
thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this
Ordinance and other related tax information to the internal revenue service,
the tax commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the City of Jackson from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 61-17. Passed 12-18-17.)
195.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the City of Jackson's ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the City of Jackson or the Tax
Administrator.

      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or

before July 1, 2018, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to the

to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or

States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the ORC, unless
a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this Ordinance that
is not otherwise defined in this Ordinance is used in a comparable context in
both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax and in Title
LVII of the ORC and the use is not consistent, then the use of the term in the
laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall control over the
use of the term in Title LVII of the ORC.
   (B)    The singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall
include the feminine
and the gender-neutral.
   (C)    As used in this Ordinance:

qualifying wages earned and/or received by each employee in the City of
Jackson. Except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required
under Section
197.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Ordinance No 34-20, of 1.5%. An employer, agent of an

or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of the City of Jackson in any month of the
preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200.
            Payment under division (B)(l)(a) of this section shall be made so

Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City of Jackson. The payment
of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an
employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required
under this section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the City of Jackson as the
return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the
tax under this Ordinance is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.

to withhold the City of Jackson income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Ordinance or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the City of Jackson the tax withheld relieves the employee
from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
City of Jackson income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent
the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City of Jackson until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator

withheld for the City of Jackson during the preceding calendar year;

calendar year;

      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City of
Jackson income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees
and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Ordinance, to be tax required to be withheld and
remitted for the purposes of this section.

made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section. For the purposes of this division, the

entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,

employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
City of Jackson only if the employee spent more time performing services for or
on behalf of the employer in the City of Jackson than in any other municipal
corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an
employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more

      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City of Jackson exceeds the 20-day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to the City of Jackson for any subsequent
days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in the City of Jackson.

Jackson under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
the City of Jackson for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the employee for personal services performed in the City of Jackson.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the City of Jackson and the
employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section

         To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator

   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the City of Jackson before the 181st day after the applicant's
active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any

period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City of
Jackson's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)
(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election

municipal income tax.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated the City of Jackson income tax return for that taxable year
if the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the City of Jackson. A taxpayer that is required
to file a consolidated the City of Jackson income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated the City of Jackson income tax return for all
subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer

   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
197.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated the City of Jackson income
tax return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section 197.02
(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to
the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated the City of Jackson income
tax return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through
entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
197.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Jackson. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
197.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Jackson. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
197.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Jackson;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City of Jackson
income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Ordinance on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated the City of Jackson income tax
return shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
197.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated the City of Jackson income tax
return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the City of Jackson in accordance with
this Ordinance on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation
is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of
such an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City of Jackson before January 1, 2021, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the City of Jackson may continue to
file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2021.

another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter/
ordinance may claim a nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the
tax paid to the other municipality. Subject to division (C) of this section,

other municipality OR the rate of 1%.
   (B)    The City of Jackson shall grant a credit against its tax on income to

employed in another municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,

tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.

         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the

that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City of Jackson,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent ( 45%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after

   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
197.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent ( 45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the City of Jackson under Section

request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (C)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall
issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied.
         The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was denied,
the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If the Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
197.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing

of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
197.18 (A)(4).

income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipality
with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)    If the City of Jackson's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the
other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City of Jackson's tax rate. However, if the City of Jackson's tax rate is
greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of
the nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the City of Jackson, along with any
penalty and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.

      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal

prosecutions under Section
197.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.

figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
197.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to

determination of federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any
additional the City of Jackson income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for
refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten
dollars.

file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
197.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City of Jackson does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
197.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
197.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover the City of Jackson income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 57-20. Passed 12-14-20.)
197.13 AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 57-20. Passed 12-14-20.)
197.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a
new last known address, including the use of a change of address service
offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section
5703.056 of the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last
known address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered
served. If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after
the assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other the City of Jackson
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(l)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by the Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
         "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date."
         Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
         If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)
(1)(a) of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other the City of
Jackson official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this
division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall
be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 57-20. Passed 12-14-20.)
197.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City of Jackson that arises pursuant to the City of Jackson's income tax
imposed in accordance
with this Ordinance.
   (B)    Nothing in this Ordinance prohibits the Tax Administrator from doing
either of the
following if such action is in the best interests of the City of Jackson:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 57-20. Passed 12-14-20.)
197.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Ordinance is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City of
Jackson as authorized by this Ordinance. The Tax Administrator or a designee
thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this
Ordinance and other related tax information to the internal revenue service,
the tax commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the City of Jackson from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 57-20. Passed 12-14-20.)
197.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the City of Jackson's ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the City of Jackson or the Tax
Administrator.

other appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-

which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income

that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
Ordinance for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if

required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and

longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the City of Jackson or for the withholding of such
tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall

vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

prescribed and shall contain such information as is reasonably necessary to a
fair determination of whether a permit should be issued. Applications shall be
filed not less than five days before the time intended for such parade,
procession, assemblage or public street use.
   The permit may be refused or cancelled if:
      (1)   The time, place, size or conduct of the parade including the
assembly areas and route of march would unreasonably interfere with the public
convenience and safe use of the streets and highways.
      (2)   The parade would require the diversion of so great a number of
police officers to properly police the line of movement, assembly area and
areas contiguous thereto so as to deny normal police protection to the
Municipality.
      (3)   The parade route of march or assembly areas would unreasonably
interfere with the movement of police vehicles, fire-fighting equipment or
ambulance service to other areas of the Municipality.
      (4)   The parade would unreasonably interfere with another parade for
which a permit has been issued.
      (5)   The information contained in the application is found to be false,
misleading or incomplete in any material detail.
      (6)   An emergency such as a fire or storm would prevent the proper
conduct of the parade.
   The permit or any order accompanying it may limit or prescribe reasonable
conditions, including the hours, the place of assembly and of dispersal, the
route of march or travel and the streets, highways or portions thereof which
may be used or occupied.

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the

   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,

   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima-facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug

combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in
a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to attend a drivers’
intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is to serve the jail
term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the court shall
sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six consecutive
days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court
may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day mandatory jail term. The
cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years. The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27,
the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

registrar shall destroy any such license, temporary instruction permit, or

      (3)   No person shall possess more than one valid license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card at any time.
         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two
or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4507.02 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

of this section has occurred, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the
offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the operator of the
motor vehicle owned by the offender or under the offender’s control is in a
category described in subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5) of this section
if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Regarding an operator allegedly in the category described in

(2) or (3) of this section, the offender previously has pleaded guilty to or
been convicted of two or more violations of division (A)(1), (2) or (3) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offender
is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree.
         B.   Whoever violates subsection (a)(4) or (5) of this section is

license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to
the state of the vehicle involved in the offense. If issued, the order shall be
issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
            If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for
criminal forfeiture under this subsection is assigned or transferred and
division (B)(2) or (3) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or
independent of any other penalty established by law, the court may fine the
offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the national
automobile dealer’s association. The proceeds from any fine imposed under this
subsection shall be distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C.
4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the
registration of the vehicle.

vehicle leasing dealers, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4549.65.
 
   (g)   Evidence of a conviction of, plea of guilty to, or adjudication as a
delinquent child for a violation of this section or a substantially similar
municipal ordinance shall not be admissible as evidence in any civil action
that involves the offender or delinquent child who is the subject of the
conviction, plea, or adjudication and that arises from the wrongful entrustment
of a motor vehicle.
   (h)   For purposes of this section, a vehicle is owned by a person if, at

license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver’s
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima-facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.
2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be sentenced to a jail
term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community residential sanction

notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be
ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community
service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an offender to complete a
term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect
criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

State.
   (e)   Any order for immobilization and impoundment under this section shall
be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.233 and 4507.02, as applicable. The

section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (f)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order
from the court, neither the Ohio Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy
registrar shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of
registration of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the
declaration of forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five
years after the date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.

obtain from any person, firm, partnership, corporation or association,
including the owner, lessee or operator of such commercial car, trailer or

   If, upon examining the statement of gross vehicle weight, the law
enforcement officer has reason to believe that the information contained
therein is correct in every respect, he shall endorse it with his name and the

officer of this City. No person shall willfully issue a written statement of
gross vehicle weight and knowingly give any false information in such
statement.

which is toxic, corrosive, an irritant, strong sensitizer, flammable or which
generates pressure through decomposition, heat or other means, if such
substance or mixture of substances may cause substantial personal injury or
illness during any customary or reasonably anticipated handling or use.
      (8)    "Toxic" applies to any substance which has the inherent capacity
to produce bodily injury to man through ingestion, inhalation or absorption
through any bond surface.
      (9)    "Highly toxic" means any substance which falls within any of the
following categories:
         A.    Produces death within fourteen days in half or more than half of
a group of ten or more laboratory white rats each weighing between 200 and 300
grams, at a single dose of fifty milligrams or less per kilogram of body
weight, when orally administered;
         B.    Produces death within fourteen days in half or more than half of
a group of ten or more laboratory white rats each weighing between 200 and 300
grams, when inhaled continuously for a period of one hour or less at an
atmospheric concentration of 200 parts per million by volume or less of gas,
vapor, mist or dust provided such concentration is likely to be encountered by
man when the substance is used in any reasonably foreseeable manner;
         C.    Produces death within fourteen days in half or more of a group
of ten or more rabbits tested in a dosage of 200 milligrams or less per
kilogram of body weight, when administered by continuous contact with the bare
skin for twenty-four hours or less.
If the available data on human experience with any substance indicates results
different from those obtained on animals in the above named dosages or
concentrations, the human data shall take precedence.
      (10)    "Corrosive" means any substance which in contact with living
tissue will cause destruction of tissue by chemical action; but shall not refer
to action on inanimate surfaces.
      (11)    "Irritant" means any substance not corrosive with the meaning of
subsection (a)(10) hereof which on immediate, prolonged or repeated contact
with normal living tissue will induce a local inflammatory reaction.
      (12)    "Strong sensitizer" means any substance which will cause on
normal living tissue, through an allergic or photodynamic process, a
hypersensitivity which becomes evident on reapplication of the same substance.
      (13)    "Extremely flammable" means any substance which has a flash point
at or below 20 degrees Fahrenheit as determined by the tagliabue open cup
tester.
      (14)    "Flammable" applies to any substance which has a flash point
above twenty degrees to and including eighty degrees Fahrenheit, as determined
by the tagliabue open cup tester; except that the flammability of the contents

Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.

State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is

conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of

network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a mentally retarded,
developmentally disabled, or physically impaired child under twenty-one years
of age shall not begin to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
501.13 JAIL EXPENSES; REIMBURSEMENT.
   (a)   Use of County Jail. Each person who is convicted of an offense for
violating a provision of the Codified Ordinances other than minor misdemeanor,
and who is required to be confined in jail, shall be confined at the Jackson

established by contract between the City and the Board of County Commissioners
of Jackson County. The amounts paid by the City for jail expenses shall be
based upon the actual costs of confinement.

the provision of food, clothing, medical care and shelter. The amount of
reimbursement shall be determined by a court at a hearing held pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.15.
   (c)   Collection of Reimbursement. The attorney for the City is authorized
to institute appropriate civil actions in the name of the municipal
corporation, in the Court of Common Pleas of Jackson County, to recover from
convicts the reimbursement for the expenses of confinement in the County Jail,
as determined by a court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.15. More than one defendant
may be joined in one suit for collection.
(Ord. 57-85. Passed 5-13-85.)
501.14 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug

R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the

      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified

   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 
Type of                      Maximum
Misdemeanor                  Fine
First degree                 $ 5000.00

classified
Minor misdemeanor not        1000.00
specifically classified
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11 , either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

      (3)   Disclosure of the information would amount to revealing a news
source, privileged under Ohio R.C. 2739.04 or 2739.12.

in danger of drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a
hospital, clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider
whose alcohol and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to Ohio R.C.

subsection, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal

vaginal or anal intercourse.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
 
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:

725.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)    "House trailer" means any self-propelled and nonself-propelled
vehicle so designed, constructed, reconstructed or added to by means of
accessories in such a manner as will permit the use and occupancy thereof for
human habitation, when connected to indicated utilities, whether resting on
wheels, jacks or other temporary foundation, or resting on a permanent
foundation replacing such wheels, jacks or other temporary foundation. A
structure which was at one time a house trailer does not become something other
than a house trailer when and if the structure is affixed permanently upon real
estate.
   (b)    "House trailer park" means any site, lot, field or tract of land upon
which six or more house trailers used for human habitation are parked free of
charge or for revenue purposes.
      (Ord. 63-80. Passed 10-13-80.)
725.02 PERMITTED PARKING.
   (a)    No person shall park or establish, or permit to be parked or
established any house trailer used for human habitation within the corporate
limits of the City except as provided in subsections (b), (c) and (d) hereof.
   (b)    House trailers already parked and established within the City on
December 10, 1952, and those parked and established in bona-fide and licensed
trailer parks are not included within the prohibition of subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)    Temporary parking of house trailers shall be permitted on the site of
permanent home construction by and for occupants of the trailers, but in no
event shall such temporary parking exceed eight months.
   (d)    A house trailer allowed under subsection (b) hereof may be replaced
at the same site by one new house trailer, provided that the old house trailer
is removed from the site and disposed of properly and that the new house
trailer is fitted onto a proper foundation, and that the owner or occupant of
the new house trailer obtains a building permit for the installation of the new
house trailer.
(Ord. 46-81. Passed 4-27-81.)
725.03 STREET PARKING.

the streets of the City subject to the traffic laws and ordinances.
(Ord. 526. Passed 11-10-52.)
725.04 TRAILER PARK LICENSE; SEWAGE FACILITIES.
   No person shall operate within the City a house trailer park without first
obtaining an annual license therefor from the Service-Safety Director. The
application for such license shall describe the proposed location of the
trailer park, the proposed number of trailer parking spaces, which must be six
or more and any additional information that the Director may require. Before
issuing a license, the Director shall investigate and determine the available
means of connecting the trailer park sewage system to the Municipally owned
sewage system. No license shall be granted by the Director unless, in his
opinion, adequate sewer mains and disposal plant facilities are available to
properly handle the proposed increased volume of sewage without endangering the
health and safety of the citizens of the City or rendering the City potentially
liable for damages due to an overloading of the sewage disposal plant. No
license shall be granted unless City sewage system facilities are available and
adequate. No septic tank type of sewage treatment or other private means of
sewage disposal shall be permitted. An absolute maximum of 200 trailer spaces
may be licensed under this section by the Director.
(Ord. 526. Passed 11-10-52.)
725.05 USE OF CITY WATER SERVICE.
   If the proposed trailer park proposes to use City water, a further
endorsement by the Superintendent of the Water Service Commission shall be
required on the license issued by the Service-Safety Director. The failure to
secure this endorsement on the license and the subsequent use of City water
shall render the license void and of no effect. The endorsement shall state
that an adequate supply of City water is available in the City to serve the
proposed increased use. The Superintendent, before endorsing the license, may
require any information that he deems necessary from the applicant and shall
not endorse any license unless and until he is satisfied that sufficient water
is available to satisfy normal consumption and that such condition is likely to
continue.
(Ord. 526. Passed 11-10-52.)
725.06 LICENSE FEE.
   The fee to be paid for licenses issued under Section
725.04 shall be no dollars per year.

permitted thereunder, the expiration date, which shall be one year from the
date of issuance, and the endorsement required by Section
725.05, if applicable. (Ord. 526. Passed 11-10-52.)
725.08 LICENSE CANCELLATION.
   The license issued under Section
725.04 or endorsement secured under Section
725.05 may be canceled by the Service-Safety Director or the Superintendent of
the Water Service Commission if such license or endorsement is obtained by
fraud or misrepresentation or for any other justifiable cause, upon the giving
of thirty day's notice to the operator or his agent in charge. (Ord. 526.
Passed 11-10-52.)

919.07 RENTS AND RIGHT-OF-WAY PLAN FOR CITY OWNED UTILITIES.
   (a)   The City adopts this plan and policy for the reimbursement of rents
and rights-of-way used by the City’s utilities. The City finds that streets,

to customers are across properties required to be maintained by the City’s
General Fund.

rents and rights- of-way, including a gross revenue plan and a footage plan
based upon number of feet and property valuations.

the City of Jackson, Ohio, and such plan shall be adopted as the basis for the
recovery of reimbursements of rents and rights-of-way used by the City’s
utilities.

to be a fair and reasonable reimbursement amount for public utilities which use
a municipal right-of-way.

(5%) of the gross revenues of the City’s utilities which access and use the
City’s streets, alleys and other public areas for the delivery of services to

shall be made with the City of Jackson’s electric, water and sewer utilities
unless and until any other entity desiring to provide such service obtains a
franchise or like permit from the City setting forth the terms and conditions
under which it may operate or serve consumers within the City. Service from
facilities existing as of the effective date of this section by a provider of
utility service to a new occupant of a premise lawfully served on the effective
date of this section pursuant to previous franchises granted by the City shall
not be precluded by this section. Likewise, service from facilities existing in
any annexed areas as of the effective date of the annexation shall be similarly
treated.
 
   (d)   This section shall not affect utility service connections and
arrangements between individual consumers within the City of Jackson and

existing and in place at the date of such annexation. Such arrangements and
connections are hereby permitted to continue, at the option of such consumer
having such arrangements and connections, unless the City of Jackson obtains
such authorization or approval as may be required under the laws of the State
of Ohio to cause such existing lawful arrangements and connections to be
terminated and utility service provided by the City to be substituted for
service provided under such other arrangements and connections.
   (e)   Nothing in this section is to be construed to:
      (1)   Limit the rights or the authority of the City of Jackson under the
laws and Constitution of Ohio, including the right to sell utility products and
services outside its corporate limits, or
      (2)   Approve the provision of utility service by any entity other than
the City, or waive any of the City’s rights to object to and supplant any such
service with its service to any consumer within the City or hereafter not
lawfully served pursuant to franchises granted by the City.
 
   (f)   The City Attorney is hereby authorized and directed to initiate, in
consultation with the Service Director such applications and other proceedings
before the courts and administrative agencies of the State of Ohio as may be
necessary and appropriate to obtain any and all orders or other relief required
to effectuate the purposes of this section.

Council for its approval, reasonable franchise or like agreements with any
entity desiring to operate facilities for the provision of or to provide
electric, water or sewer utility service to consumers within the City. (Ord.

Section V
Power Cost Adjustment
Applicable:
The rates and charges set forth in City’s Electric Service Rates are based upon
an assumed average cost of City’s power supply. In the event that said monthly
overall average power costs per kWh is increased or decreased due to changes in
load characteristics, wholesale rates, fuel costs, taxes, other adjustments, or
modifications to the City’s power supply arrangements, City’s Electric Service
Rates to which this Power Costs Adjustment applies (except outdoor lighting)
will be adjusted as specified below.
Base Power Cost:
The overall Base Power Cost to be used to determine the adjustment applicable
to the city’s Electric Rate Schedules shall be that included in the City’s
retail rates of $0.09004 per kWh.
Monthly Determination of Power Cost Adjustment:
   A.   Each month, the City’s running six (6) month average Power Supply Cost
per kWh shall be determined by dividing (1) the sum of (i) the previous five
(5) and current months’ total power supply costs from all suppliers, plus (ii)
the previous five (5) and current months’ net costs associated with ownership
and operation of generating facilities owned in whole or in part, by the City,
plus (iii) the previous five (5) and current months’ transmission related
charges and credits and AMP Service Fees, by (2) the total energy delivered to
the City in the previous five (5) months and current month.
   B.   If said running six (6) month average Power Cost for the current month
is a ABOVE or BELOW the Base Power Cost of $0.09004 per kWh, the rates per kWh
set forth in City’s Electric Service rates shall be INCREASED or DECREASED in
the manner specified in (C) and (D) below.
   C.   Any INCREASE or DECREASE per kWh ABOVE or BELOW the Base Power Cost of
$0.09004 per kWh shall be determined to five (5) dermal places ($0.00000) and
any resultant differential shall be divided by 0.85 to compensate for City’s
distribution system energy losses.
   D.   The rates per kWh set forth in City’s Electrical Service Rates shall be
INCREASED or DECREASED accordingly.
Application of Power Costs Adjustment to all Consumer Bills:
   A.   Any applicable adjustment shall be applied to the kWh billed consumers
for the meter reading period that the City determines as most nearly
corresponding to the meter reading period(s) set forth in City’s billing from
its power supplier(s).
   B.   All adjustments shall be applied to the total kWh billed to consumer
and shall be in addition to the minimum charge applicable for the schedule
involved.

02).
      (1)   Install and maintain a grease interceptor that complies with
(Chapter 4101:2-56-69 OAC).
      (2)   Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials
such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, towels and
rags, etc., which could settle into the soils blanket and thereby reduce the
effective volume of the grease interceptor.
      (3)   Operate and maintain the grease interceptor to achieve and maintain
an applicable action level. Applicable shall mean the compliance with any
regulatory narrative or numeric value established by the Authority.
      (4)   Contracted service providers maintaining grease interceptors within
the City of Jackson, Ohio shall be registered with the Jackson County
Department of Health, and obtain a permit from the Authority.
      (5)   When servicing grease interceptors within the City of Jackson,
Ohio, all service providers must have, in their possession, the proper permit
as issued by the Authority.
      (6)   The use of biological or other additives as grease degradation or
conditioning agents is permissible only upon prior written permission granted

   National categorical pretreatment standards as promulgated by the U.S. EPA
pursuant to the Act shall be met by all dischargers of the regulated industrial
categories.
   POTW may determine Equivalent Mass and Concentration Limits using
categorical pretreatment standards and the average daily production and flow.
Industrial users must promptly notify the POTW of expected production changes.
Equivalent Mass and Concentration Limits are made legally enforceable where
they are established; they are deemed pretreatment standards which industrial
users will be required to comply with in lieu of the promulgated standards.
   Categorical Pretreatment Standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence
of pollutants in the industrial user's intake water. Applications for intake
pollutant credit must be made to the POTW instead of the U.S. EPA. The POTW may
also waive the "same body of water" requirement if it finds that no
environmental degradation will result.
926.05 STATE AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   State and federal requirements and limitations on discharges to the POTW
shall be met by all dischargers which are subject to such standards in any
instance in which they are more stringent than the limitations of this or any
other applicable local ordinance.
926.06 SUPPLEMENTARY LIMITATIONS.
   (a)    No discharger shall discharge or cause or allow to be discharged into
the sewerage system any pollutant in concentrations above those specifically
permitted in administrative orders issued by the Director. Administrative
orders shall impose maximum discharge concentration limits or mass based limits
where appropriate. In the absence of such administrative orders, no person
shall discharge any of the following pollutants, except as such pollutants may
occur, and only in the concentrations such pollutants may occur, in normal
domestic sewage: Cadmium, Chromium - Total, Chromium Hexavalent, Copper, Lead,
Nickel, Zinc, Mercury, Arsenic, Selenium, Molybdenum, Silver, Gold, Platinum,
Palladium.

million by weight; or
      (2)    Containing more than 350 parts per million by weight of suspended
solids; or
      (3)    Containing any quantity of substances having the characteristic
described in Section
926.03; or
      (4)    Having an average daily flow greater than two percent (2%) of the
average daily sewage flow of the City.
   (c)    The City may impose mass limitations on individual dischargers, when
in the opinion of the Director it is necessary to attain the objectives set
forth in Section
926.01.
 
   (d)    The City reserves the right to establish discharge limitations more
stringent than those contained in this chapter, when in the opinion of the
Director it is necessary to attain the objectives set forth in Section
926.01.
926.07 TRUCKED AND HAULED WASTES.
   Pursuant to Section
927.07; No person shall access the sewer system or POTW for any activity
including discharge of hauled septic or industrial wastes except at locations
and at times as designated by the Director. Any removal of manhole lids, or
other access to the sewer system for the purpose of discharging wastes at times
and/or locations other than those designated by the Superintendent or without
the expressed permission of the Superintendent shall be considered a violation
and shall be subject to enforcement action including fines and penalties
allowed under Section
926.99 (Penalty).
   Such waste shall not violate Section
926.03 of this Chapter or any other requirements established by the City. The
Superintendent may require septic tank waste haulers and haulers of industrial
waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits.
   The Superintendent may require generators of hauled industrial waste to
obtain wastewater discharge permits. The Superintendent also may prohibit the
disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste
is subject to all other requirements of this chapter.
   No load may be discharged without prior consent of the Superintendent. The
Superintendent may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste
analysis of any load prior to discharge.
   Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load.
This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial
waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of
sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall
identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents, and
whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.
926.08 PRETREATMENT REQUIRED.
   (a)    Users shall provide necessary pretreatment of wastewater to comply
with applicable discharge limitations contained in Sections
926.03 to
926.06. Any facilities to pretreat wastewater shall be provided, operated and
maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the existing
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the City
for review and shall be acceptable to the City. The review of such plans and
operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to City
under the provision of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the method of
operation or upgrading of pretreatment facilities which were in use at the
effective date of this section shall be reported to and be acceptable to the
City prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
   (b)    Where necessary in the opinion of the Director, the industrial user
shall provide, at his expense, such pretreatment as may be necessary to reduce
objectionable characteristics or constituents to within the maximum limits
provided for in Section
926.03 or to control the quantities and rates of discharge of such waters or
wastes.
   (c)    Whenever deemed necessary, the Superintendent may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams,
and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine
the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (d)    The Superintendent may require any person discharging into the POTW
to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
   (e)    Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Director, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid
wastes containing grease in excessive amounts or any flammable wastes, sand and
other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required
for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a
type and capacity approved by the Director and shall be located so as to be
readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors
shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at
their expense and remain in continuous efficient operation at all times.
   (f)    Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious
material capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature.
They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped with easily
removable covers which, when bolted in place, shall be gastight and watertight.
   (g)    Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
926.09 PERMIT TO INSTALL.
   A Permit to Install (PTI) shall be required of industrial users when new
facilities will be required to meet the objectives of this chapter, showing
detailed plans, specifications and any other pertinent information relating to
proposed pretreatment facilities, including operating procedures and shall be
submitted for approval of the Ohio EPA with a copy being submitted to the City;
no construction of such facilities shall commence until the PTI is approved in
writing in accordance with Ohio R.C. 6111.31, 6111.44 and 6111.45.
   All such facilities shall be operated according to Section
926.08. Such approval does not, in any way, guarantee that the facilities will
function satisfactorily or that it will not be necessary to enlarge or to
otherwise modify the facilities to make them capable of providing satisfactory
pretreatment. It remains the responsibility of the user to assure compliance
with all discharge limitations.
926.10 DILUTION.
   No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt
to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly
authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The
Superintendent may impose mass limitation on users who are using dilution to
meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when
the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
   Prohibition of dilution applies to both local limits compliance and
categorical pretreatment standards.
926.11 PROTECTION FROM ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE.
   (a)    Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge to the
sewerage system of wastes prohibited or restricted by this chapter. Such
required protection may include walls or dikes, separate storage, removal of
drain lines from locations where significant quantities of prohibited materials
are maintained or other appropriate procedures to assure the prevention of
discharge to the City sewerage system.
   (b)    Plans for installation of such control facilities or operating
procedures shall be submitted to the Director for approval prior to
construction or at the time such control facilities are found to be necessary
by either the user or the Director. The review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures shall not relieve the user of responsibility for
preventing the discharge of unacceptable materials to the City sewerage system.
   (c)    Industrial users both categorical and non-categorical must notify the
POTW immediately in the event of any discharge, including slug loads, with the
potential to cause problems at the POTW. Users shall notify the department
through an emergency spill number (614-286-1137) or by other means to be
established by the Department, immediately upon accidental loss of prohibited
materials or those unacceptable for discharge to enable counter
measures to be taken to minimize damage to the wastewater treatment system and/
or the receiving waters.
   Where such information is given orally, a written follow-up report thereof
shall be filed by the discharger with the Director within five days, which
specifies:
      (1)    A description of the accidental discharge, the cause of it and
impact on the discharger's compliance status.
      (2)    Duration of noncompliance including exact dates and times, and the
time compliance is expected to occur.
      (3)    Steps taken or which will be taken to reduce, eliminate and
prevent reoccurrence of the accidental discharge.
   Such notification will not relieve users of liability for any consequential
expense, loss or damage to the wastewater treatment system or for any fines
and/or penalties imposed on the department which results from the violative
discharge.
   (d)    Any direct or indirect connection or entry point for prohibited or
deleterious wastes to the sewerage system shall be eliminated. Where such
action is impractical, the Director may give permission to place appropriate
notices at entry points to warn against discharge of such wastes in violation
of this chapter.
   (e)    The Superintendent may require any user to develop, submit for
approval, and implement a Slug Control Plan. An Accidental Discharge/Slug
Control Plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
      (1)    Description of discharge practices; including nonroutine batch
discharges;
       (2)    Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)    Procedures for immediately notifying the Superintendent of any
accidental or slug discharge.
       (4)    Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other
prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge as
described in this Section. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may
cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification
procedure.
926.12 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (a)    Industrial users who shall provide pretreatment of wastewaters as a
result of any Federal, State or Local regulation, industrial users who are
being surcharged for extra-strength wastewaters or any industrial user
designated by the City shall be required to provide and operate, at the user's
own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow
measurement of the building sewer(s) which connect to the POTW. The requirement
of flow-measurement devices shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the
City. Monitoring facilities shall be situated on the discharger's premises,
unless so specified by the City, and shall be constructed and maintained in
accordance with local construction standards and specifications.
   (b)    When required by the City, the owner of any property served by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install suitable facilities
together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building
sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, control and measurement of the
wastes. Such manholes, when required, shall be easily accessible to the
Authority and safely located. The manholes, necessary meters and appurtenances
shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him
so as to be safe and accessible and in proper operating condition at all times.
Regardless of whether or not monitoring facilities are required by the City,
the owner shall provide convenient access to all sampling points deemed
necessary by the City such that independent sampling can be carried out by the
City.
926.13 ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS.
   The Superintendent shall issue, at any time deemed necessary, an
administrative order to any user to control the user's discharge to the
sewerage system and ensure compliance with any regulation established by this
chapter including, but not limited to, the following:

exceed five (5) years from the effective date of the order. Each administrative
order will indicate a specified date upon which it will expire.
   An administrative order shall include such conditions as are deemed
reasonably necessary by the Superintendent to prevent pass through or
interference, protect the quality of the water body receiving the treatment
plant's effluent, protect worker health and safety, facilitate sludge
management and disposal, and protect against damage to the POTW.
   Any person, including the user, may petition the Superintendent to
reconsider the terms of an administrative order within thirty (30) days of
notice of its issuance.
   The Superintendent may modify an administrative order for good cause.
   The Superintendent may revoke an administrative order for good cause,
including, but not limited to, the following reasons:
      (1)    Failure to notify the Superintendent of significant changes to the
wastewater prior to the changed discharge;
      (2)    Failure to provide prior notification to the Superintendent of
changed conditions pursuant to Section
926.16 of this chapter;
      (3)    Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts
in the wastewater discharge disclosure form;

complete wastewater discharge disclosure form, the Director will determine
whether or not to issue an Administrative Order.
   (d)    All users not required to obtain a wastewater administrative order
shall provide appropriate reports to the City as the City may require.
926.15 BYPASS.
   For the purpose of this section, "bypass" means the intentional diversion of
wastestream from any portion of a user's treatment facility; and "severe
property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the
treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and
permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur
in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss
caused by delays in production.
   Industrial user's may bypass pretreatment systems for essential maintenance
if standards or requirements are not violated and prior notice is given to the
POTW, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. All
other bypasses are prohibited and the POTW may take enforcement action.
Prohibited bypasses may be excusable when bypass was unavoidable to prevent
loss of life, personal injury, severe property damage, or where there were no
feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment
facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods
of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up
equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering
judgement to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment
downtime or preventive maintenance.
   A user shall submit oral notice to the City of an unanticipated bypass that
exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from
the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be
provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass.
   The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its
cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the
bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue;
and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of
the bypass. The City may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if
the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.
926.16 ANTICIPATED CHANGES IN DISCHARGE.
   (a)   All industrial users tributary to the POTW who anticipate significant
changes in the quantity or characteristics of their discharge to the POTW shall
promptly notify the Superintendent in advance of these substantial changes in
the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed
or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted
initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p). All industrial users must contact
the POTW thirty days prior to any changes in their discharge.
   (b)   Significant Industrial Users are required to notify the Superintendent
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a Slug
Discharge.
(Ord. 07-14. Passed 1-13-14.)
926.17 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40
CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance
with "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater."
926.18 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (a)   Reporting required must be based upon data obtained through
appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the
report, which data are representative of conditions occurring during the
reporting period. Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil
and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants,
24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the City. Where time-proportional composite sampling
or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must be representative
of the Discharge and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be
documented in the Industrial User file for that facility or facilities. Using
protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour
period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: For cyanide, total
phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the
field; for volatile organics and oil & grease the samples may be composited in
the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
composting procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the City, as appropriate.
   (b)   All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures
established by the USEPA pursuant to Section 304(h) of the Act and contained in
40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures
approved by the USEPA. (See §§ 136.4 and 136.5). Sampling shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques approved by the USEPA. Where 40 CFR Part 136
does not include sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in
question, or where the USEPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and
analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling
and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW
or other parties, approved by the USEPA.
   (c)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in 40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of four (4)
grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease,
sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical
sampling does not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are
available, the Superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports
required by 40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h), the Industrial User is required to
collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by
and with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
   (d)   In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the City may
authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4) grab
samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative
sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
   (e)   Samples collected by the City for the purpose of determining
compliance by industrial users shall be split and a portion given to the
industrial user upon request. The City will bill the user appropriately for the
cost of sampling and analyses performed to determine compliance.
   (f)   The City may require the user to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own
expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated as needed to ensure their accuracy.
(Ord. 07-14. Passed 1-13-14.)
926.19 TIMING.
   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
926.20 DISCHARGE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Compliance Date Report. Within ninety days following the date for
final compliance by the discharger with applicable categorical pretreatment
standards set forth in this chapter or ninety days following commencement on
the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new discharger, any
discharger subject to this chapter shall submit to the City a report including
new production, the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated
substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow
in gallons, and information as described in Section
926.14  of this chapter. Also required is the production data from industrial
users subject to production based standards, and long term production rate data
for industrial users with equivalent limits. The report shall state whether the
applicable categorical pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on
a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance and/
or pretreatment is necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the
applicable categorical pretreatment standards or requirements. If needed a
compliance schedule shall be prepared according to requirements in Section
926.25 . All reports shall be signed by an authorized representative of the
discharger or his designee, in accordance with Part (d) of this Section.
   (b)    Periodic Compliance Reports. All industrial users shall submit
periodic compliance reports indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in their discharge. All Significant Industrial Users must, at a
frequency determined by the Superintendent submit no less than twice per year
(June and December) reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants
in the discharge which are limited by Pretreatment Standards and the measured
or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases
where the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a Best Management
Practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the User must submit
documentation required by the Superintendent or the Pretreatment Standard
necessary to determine the compliance status of the User. The frequency of
monitoring and reporting shall be as prescribed in the Industrial User's
Wastewater Administrative Orders. This report shall include a record of all
measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows, including the nature and
concentration, or production and mass information where required by the City;
the report shall also contain all results of sampling and analysis of the
discharge. In addition, this report shall include a description of the type and
amount of residuals generated by the user during the reporting period and a
description of how and where these residuals were disposed of.
      (1)   If sampling performed by any Industrial User indicates a violation,
the User shall notify the City within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of
the violation. The user shall repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation.
Resampling by the Industrial User is not required if the City performs sampling
at the User’s facility at least once a month, or if the City performs sampling
at the User between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the
time when the User or the City receives the results of this sampling, or if the
City has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the Industrial User.
Results of sampling above the minimum required shall be reported if analysis
were conducted according to methodology in Section
926.17 of this chapter.
      (2)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working orders at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      (3)   These reports shall include the certification statement and shall
be signed by an authorized representative of the discharger as defined in Part
(d) of this Section.
   (c)    Baseline Monitoring Report Deadline for New Sources. New sources and
existing sources that become industrial users subsequent to promulgation of
categorical standards are required to submit baseline monitoring reports at
least 90 days prior to the commencement of discharge. Elements to be contained
in the baseline monitoring report are listed in Section
926.14  of this Chapter. New Sources are required to install and start-up
technology prior to discharge and to achieve compliance within the shortest
time feasible, not to exceed 90 days after commencement of discharge. If needed
a compliance schedule shall be prepared according to requirements in Section
926.25 . All reports shall be signed by an authorized representative of the
discharger or his designee, in accordance with Part (d) of this Section
   (d)    Reporting Signatories and Certification. All wastewater discharge
applications and user reports must be signed by an authorized representative of
the user and contain the following certification statement:
   "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violation."
(Ord. 07-14. Passed 1-13-14.)
926.21 RIGHT OF ENTRY FOR INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (a)    The City may inspect the pretreatment and/or the monitoring
facilities of any discharger to determine compliance with the requirements of
this chapter. The discharger shall allow the City or its representatives, upon
presentation of credentials of identification, to enter upon the premises of
the discharger at all reasonable hours for the purposes of inspection, sampling
or records examination, including the authority to copy records of the
industrial user. The City shall have the right to set up on the discharger's
property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
   (b)    The City shall be permitted to enter all private properties through
which the City holds a duly negotiated easement for the purpose of, but not
limited to, inspection, observation, measurement, repair, sampling and
maintenance of any portion of the wastewater works lying within such easement.
All entry and subsequent work, if any, on such easement, shall be done in full
accordance with the terms of the duly negotiated easement pertaining to the
private property involved.
   (c)    While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to
hereof, the City shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises
established by the company and the company shall be held harmless for injury or
death to the City employees, and the City shall indemnify the company against
liability claims and demands for personal injury or property damage asserted
against the company and growing out of the gauging and sampling operation,
except as such may be caused by negligence or failure of the company to
maintain safe conditions.
   (d)    All sampling or analytical techniques should adhere to those set
forth in Section
926.17 and
926.18 of this chapter.
   (e)    Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the City and shall not be replaced. The
costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
   (f)    Unreasonable delays in allowing the City access to the user's
premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
926.22 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the City has been refused access to a building, structure, or property,
or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that
there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect
and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the City
designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, then the City may seek issuance of a search warrant from the proper
court of this County.
926.23 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information furnished by an industrial user to the City shall be available
to the public or other governmental agency without restriction, unless the user
demonstrates that the release of such information would endanger its
competitive position. Upon the request of the discharger that is furnishing the
report, portions of the report which may disclose trade secrets or secret
processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be
made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related
to this chapter, the NPDES permit and/or the pretreatment programs. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics shall not be recognized as confidential
information. Information accepted by the City as confidential shall not be
transmitted to any governmental agency by the City until and unless a ten-day
notification is given to the discharger.
926.24 RECORDS RETENTION.
   (a)   All industrial users who discharge or propose to discharge wastewaters
to the wastewater treatment plant shall maintain such records of production and
related factors, effluent flows and pollutant amounts and concentrations of
such pollutants that are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the
requirements of this chapter and any applicable State or Federal pretreatment
standards or requirements. Such records shall be made available upon request by
the City.
   (b)   Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. Any additional records of
information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by Management
Practices shall also be maintained. All records shall be retained by the
industry for at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended
for the duration of any litigation concerning the User of the City, or where
the User has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the
Superintendent.
(Ord. 07-14. Passed 1-13-14.)
926.25 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)    When a user is in violation of any limitation or requirement of this
chapter or any other applicable Federal or State law, the Director shall serve
a written notice to such user, stating the nature of the violation. Within
twenty days of the receipt of the violation notice, an explanation of the
violation and a plan for satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to
include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the City.
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation.
Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the City to take any
action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without
first issuing a Notice of Violation. If the violation is not corrected by
timely compliance, the user shall appear before Council to show reason why
enforcement action should not be taken and or a compliance schedule prepared. A
written notice specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed
enforcement action, the reason for such action, and a request that the user
show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice
of meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting. Such
notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause
hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user. 
(b)    The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule:
      (1)    When the City finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an administrative order or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the City may
issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the
user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come
into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be disconnected
unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances
are installed and properly operated. Compliance schedules may also contain
other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-
monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance schedule may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance schedule relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
      (2)    The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
milestone dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to
the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required or the user
to meet the applicable pretreatment standards, for example, hiring an engineer,
completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contracts for
major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc. and/or
all steps to be taken to achieve compliance.
      (3)    No increment referred to in subsection (b)(1) hereof shall exceed
nine (9) months.
      (4)    No later than fourteen days following each milestone date in the
schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress
report to the Director, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress to be met on such milestone date and, if not, the date on
which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for
delay and the steps being taken by the user to return the construction to the
schedule established.
      (5)    In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports to the Superintendent.
   The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance
date established for the applicable pretreatment.
   (c)    Any discharger or interested party shall have the right to request,
in writing, an interpretation or ruling by the City on any matter covered by
this chapter and shall be entitled to a prompt written reply. In the event that
such an inquiry is made by a discharger and deals with matters of compliance
with this chapter for which enforcement activity relating to an alleged
violation is the subject, receipt of a discharger's request shall stay all
enforcement proceedings pending receipt of the aforesaid written reply.
926.26 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   When the City finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an administrative order, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to
recur, the City may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist
all such violations and directing the user to:
   (a)    Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   (b)    Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   Issuance of cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
926.27 ANNUAL PUBLICATION OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.
   A list of all dischargers who were the subject of enforcement proceedings
pursuant to this chapter during the twelve previous months shall be published
annually by the City in the largest daily newspaper, published in the City.
This publication shall summarize the enforcement actions taken against the
dischargers during the same twelve months, who were in significant
noncompliance of applicable pretreatment requirements.
926.28 OPERATIONAL UPSETS.
   Any discharger who experiences an upset in operations which causes an
unintentional and temporary state of noncompliance with this chapter because of
factors beyond the reasonable control of the user shall inform the Director
within twenty-four hours of first awareness of the upset. For the purposes of
this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is
unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment
standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An
upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error,
improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack
of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
   Where such information is given orally, a written follow-up report thereof
shall be filed by the discharger with the Director within five days which
specifies:
    (a)    A description of the upset, the cause of it and the impact on the
discharger's compliance status.
   (b)    Duration of noncompliance including exact dates and times, and the
time compliance is expected to occur.
   (c)    Steps taken or which will be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent
reoccurrence of the upset.
   A documented and verified bona fide operating upset shall be an affirmative
defense to any enforcement action brought by the City against a discharger for
any noncompliance with this chapter which arises out of violations alleged to
have occurred during the period of the upset.
   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to
maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction,
loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the
treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
926.29 CHARGES FOR DAMAGES TO SYSTEM.
   When a discharge of wastes by any user causes an obstruction of, damage or
impairment to any part of the sewer system or treatment facilities, a charge
shall be levied by the City against such user for the cost of the work required
to clean, clear, repair and/or replace the part of the system or facilities
affected by such discharge. The City shall add this charge to the user's usual
service charges, surcharges or fees.
926.30 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   The City may take action necessary to deny new or increased wastewater
discharges and/or immediately halt a wastewater discharge by any user if:
   (a)    Imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of people, to the
environment or to the POTW is presented.
   (b)    A discharge would cause the City to violate its NPDES permit.
    (c)    A user fails to factually report wastewater constituents or
characteristics.
   (d)    A user fails to report significant changes in wastewaters
constituents or characteristics.
   (e)    A user refuses reasonable access to its premises for the purpose of
monitoring and inspection.
   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or
eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately
comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City may take such steps as
deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment
to any individuals. The City may allow the user to recommence its discharge
when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City that the period
of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in Section
926.32 of this order are initiated against the user.
   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the City prior to the date of any show cause
or termination hearing under Section
926.25 and
926.32 of this chapter.
   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any emergency suspension under this section.
926.31 WATER SUPPLY SEVERANCE.
   Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
chapter, administrative orders, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only
recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its
ability to comply.
926.32 TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.
   In addition to the provisions in Section
926.13 of this chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
   (a)    Violation of wastewater administrative orders conditions;
   (b)    Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
   (c)    Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
   (d)    Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
   (e)    Violation of the pretreatment standards in Section
926.03 of this chapter.
   Such user will be notified thirty (30) days prior to the proposed
termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under
Section
926.25 of this Chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of
this option by the City shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user.
926.33 PERFORMANCE BONDS.
   The City may decline to issue or reissue an administrative order to any user
who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, a previous
administrative order, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless
such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the City of Jackson, in a
sum not to exceed a value determined by the Director to be necessary to achieve
consistent compliance.
926.34 LIABILITY INSURANCE.
   The City may decline to issue or reissue an administrative order to any user
who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, a previous
administrative order, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless
the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances
sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
926.35 PUBLIC NUISANCES.
   A violation of any provision of this chapter, administrative order, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance
and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the City. Any person(s)
creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the City of
Jackson Codified Ordinances governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the
City for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance.
926.36 FALSIFYING INFORMATION.
   No person shall make any false statement, representation or certification in
any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be
maintained in accordance with this chapter, or falsify, tamper with or render
inaccurate any monitoring device or method required. Additionally, the Director
may terminate treatment services and/or revoke administrative orders in cases
involving falsification or tampering as well as being subjected to punishment
under the criminal laws of the City and/or any civil penalties.
926.37 RIGHT TO AMEND.
   The City reserves the right to amend this chapter and the terms and
conditions hereof, in order to assure compliance by the City with all
applicable Local, State and Federal laws and regulations. All national
categorical pretreatment standards adopted after the promulgation of this
chapter shall be adopted by the City as part of this chapter. The discharger
shall be informed of any proposed changes in this chapter at least thirty days
prior to the effective date of the change. Any changes or new conditions in the
chapter shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
926.38 SPECIAL AGREEMENTS.
   No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the City and any industrial concern
whereby industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by
the City for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern,
providing the objectives set forth in Section
926.01 and categorical pretreatment standards are attained. Such payment shall
be regulated as set forth in Section
927.05.
926.39 SEVERABILITY.
   The provisions of this chapter are severable, and if any provision of this
order, or application of any provision of this chapter to any circumstance, is
held invalid, the application of such provisions to other circumstances, and
the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.
926.40 REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE.
   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The City may
take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user.
Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the
City's enforcement response plan. However, the City may take other action
against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the City is empowered
to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
926.41 PRETREATMENT CHARGES AND FEES.
   The City may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up
and operating the City of Jackson's Pretreatment Program which may include:
    (a)    Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures
including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and
reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users;
   (b)    Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures
and construction;
   (c)    Fees for filing appeals;
   (d)    Fees for issuing administrative orders including the cost of
processing the order.
   (e)    Other fees as the City may deem necessary to carry out the
requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered
by this chapter and are separate from all other fees, fines, and penalties
chargeable by the City.
926.42 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000. Such fines
shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or
other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day
during the period of violation.
   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar days,
be assessed an additional penalty of ten (10) percent of the unpaid balance,
and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of ten (10) percent per month. A
lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and
penalties.
   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the
Superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment within thirty
(30) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the
Superintendent may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's
appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto,
shall be returned to the user. The Superintendent may add the costs of
preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to
the fine.
926.43 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   When the Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director may
petition the appropriate Court through the City's Attorney for the issuance of
a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels
the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other
requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The Director may
also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable
relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental
remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
926.99 PENALTY.
   If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes into the
City's wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this chapter,

meanings ascribed to them as shown:
         A.   "Normal sewage" means sewage which, when analyzed shows, by
weight, a daily average of not more than 350 parts per million of suspended
solids, and not more than 300 parts per million of biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD).
         B.   "Suspended solids" means solids that either float on the surface
of, or are in suspension in water, sewage or other liquids, and which are
removable by laboratory filtering.
         C.   "BOD" (denoting biochemical oxygen demand) means the quantity of
oxygen utilized in the biochemical oxidation of organic matter, under standard
laboratory procedure, in five days at twenty degrees Centigrade, expressed in
parts per million by weight.
      (2)   Sewage or industrial wastes above normal sewage strength, but
acceptable for discharge into the sanitary sewage system, shall be subject to a
surcharge. The surcharge shall be determined on the basis of either or both of
two constituents of water or wastes:
         A.   Total suspended solids, and/or
         B.   Five-day BOD at twenty degrees Centigrade and as herein provided.
      (3)   When either or both the total suspended solids (referred to as
“TSS”) and the BOD of a water or waste accepted for admission to the system
exceeds the values of their constituents for normal sewage, the excess
concentration in either or both, as the case may be, shall be subject to a
daily surcharge as follows:
 
POUNDS OF TSS $0.392
POUNDS OF BOD $0.325
      (4)   In addition to the surcharge the user will pay the user charges as
defined in subsection (b) hereof. The pounds of BOD per day and/or pounds of
suspended solids per day, above the concentrations previously described for
normal strength sewage that are discharged to the sewage system, shall be
determined by the City or its authorized representative.
            In addition to a surcharge on BOD and suspended solids, the City
shall have the right to surcharge any user for the discharge of any other
pollutant into the sewage system or for any other reason that it deems
necessary and appropriate, such as excessively high rates of discharge.

water meter acceptable to the Service-Safety Director the quantity of water
used, as measured by the meter, shall determine the sewer charge thereon, as
provided in this chapter.
   (b)    On premises either using water exclusively supplied by the City or
exclusively supplied from other sources, where the quantity of water used is
not measured by a water meter or is measured by a water meter not acceptable to

sources, which in either case is not measured by a water meter or is measured
by a water meter not acceptable to the Service-Safety Director, the owner or
other interested party shall, at his expense, install and maintain water meters
satisfactory to the Director to measure all such supplies of water, and the
quantity of water used to determine the sewer charge thereon shall be the sum
of the quantities of water measured by such several meters, as provided in this
chapter
   (d)    In the event it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Service-
Safety Director with respect to any premises, that a portion of the water from
any source used thereon does not and cannot enter the system, then in each such
case, the owner or other interested party may at his expense install and
maintain separate water meters where necessary so as to show to the
satisfaction of the Director that portion of the water used which is discharged
into the system, and the quantity of water used, as measured by such meter or
meters showing discharge into the system shall determine the sewer charge
thereon, as provided in this chapter.

   All buildings or structures which are structurally unsafe or not provided
with adequate egress, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise
dangerous to human life or which in relation to existing use constitute a
hazard to health by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, or
obsolescence, are for the purpose of this chapter "unsafe buildings." All such
unsafe buildings are declared to be public nuisances which shall be abated by
repair or rehabilitation or by demolition in accordance with the procedure of
this chapter.
(Ord. 29-94. Passed 5-9-94.)
1323.02 INSPECTION AND CITATION TO OWNER.
   The Service Director shall examine or cause to be examined every building or
structure or portion thereof reported as or believed to be an unsafe building
as defined in Section
1323.01. The Service Director shall issue a citation to the owner or owners of
record, including any purchaser under a recorded land contract. The citation
shall specifically state the defects which cause the building to be unsafe. It
shall also state that work must commence within 30 days (except in an
emergency), either to complete specified repairs or improvements or to demolish
and remove the building or structure, or portion thereof, leaving the premises
in a clean, safe and sanitary condition. In cases of emergency making
immediately repairs necessary, the Service Director may order the changes or
demolition to be commenced within a shorter period than 30 days. The citation
shall advise the owner that failure to remedy the conditions specified may
result in condemnation proceedings. The final clean, safe and sanitary
condition shall be subject to the approval of the Service Director.
(Ord. 29-94. Passed 5-9-94.)
1323.03 SERVICE OF CITATION.
   Proper service of this citation shall be by personal service, residence
service or by certified mail (return receipt requested), provided, however,
that such citation shall be deemed properly served if a citation thereof is
sent by certified mail to the County Auditor's tax-mailing address of the owner
or owners of record, including any purchaser under a land contract. If none of
the parties can be located, or if none of the parties' addresses can be
ascertained, then this citation shall be deemed to be properly served if a copy
thereof is placed in a conspicuous place on or about the building or structure
affected by this citation. If such citation by certified mail, the 30 day
period within which the owners are required to comply with the order of the
Service Director shall begin as of the date when the return receipt is signed
by any of the above-specified parties or by a member of the addressee's family.
(Ord. 29-94. Passed 5-9-94.)
1323.04 NOTICE OF VIOLATION FOR RENTAL PROPERTY.

   (1)    Has been provided with notice and an opportunity for a judicial
hearing before being barred or
   (2)    If, in an emergency, the severity of the conditions and danger to the
health and safety does not permit prior notice and hearing, then a notice and

1331.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of Jackson, State of Ohio, does ordain as
follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Jackson has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barrier, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Jackson as identified in Section
1331.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
City of Jackson.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   "Flood Insurance Rate Map, Jackson County, Ohio, and Incorporated
Areas" effective December 18, 2009 and "Flood Insurance Study" effective
December 18, 2009.
      (2)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Jackson as required by Section
1331.04(c) Subdivisions and Other New Developments.
         Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the City office located at the Memorial Building,
145 Broadway Street, Jackson, Ohio 45640.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations are not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and
another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Jackson, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof,
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 10-24. Passed 3-25-24.)

chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)
      The water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified
datum, usually the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North
American Vertical Datum of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level
(MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base flood elevation is the lowest adjacent
natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to 3 feet).
   (e)   Basement
      Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level)
on all sides.
   (f)   Development

assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified
special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
      The agency with the overall responsibility for administering the National
Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill
      A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding
      A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of
normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)
      Usually the initial map, produced by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, for a community
depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
      An official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has delineated the areas of
special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones
      Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the
flood hazard in specific areas of a community. Following are the zone
definitions:
      Zone A:
      Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given
year; base flood elevations are not determined.
      Zones Al-30 and Zone AE:
      Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given
year; base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone AO:
      Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given
year; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain);
average depths are determined.
      Zone AH:
      Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given
year; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      Zone A99:
      Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be
protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
      Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
      Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
      Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
      The official report in which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has provided flood
profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps), and the water surface elevations of the base flood.
   (p)   Floodproofing
      Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or
adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate
or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their
contents.
   (q)   Flood Protection Elevation
      The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the base flood elevation plus
0 feet of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (r)   Floodway
      A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized
by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (s)   Freeboard
      A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the
purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many
unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height
calculated for a selected size flood and flood way conditions, such as wave
action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic
effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (t)   Historic structure
      Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (u)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis
      An analysis performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State
of Ohio, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA,
used to determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (v)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC)
      A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
         A revision based on technical data showing that a property was
incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends
the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific
property is not located in a special flood hazard area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
         A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade
changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and
floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a
LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been
elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded
from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
         A comment by FEMA regarding a proposed project that would, upon
construction, affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding
source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway,
the effective base flood elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR
does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (w)   Lowest floor
      The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a
structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the lowest floor" which
is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area,
provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design
requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures below the lowest
floor.
   (x)   Manufactured home
      A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes of these
regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile homes
as defined in Chapter 4781 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (y)   Manufactured home park
      As specified in the Ohio Adm. Code 4781-12-0l(K), a manufactured home
park means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used
for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and
includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority. Manufactured home park does not include any tract of land used
solely for the storage or display for sale of manufactured homes.
   (z)   Mean sea level
      For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood
elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
   (aa)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
      The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating
communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. This
insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster
assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and
their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an
agreement between local communities and the Federal government that states if a
community will adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce
future flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the
Federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as
a financial protection against flood loss.
   (bb)   New construction
      Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after
the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by the City of Jackson
and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
      For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the
"start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial
FIRM June 1, 1984 or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (cc)   Person
      Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C. §111.15
(A)(2) as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (dd)   Recreational vehicle
      A vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis, (2) 400 square feet or
less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, (3) designed to be
self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and (4) designed
primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters
for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Architect
      A person registered to engage in the practice of architecture pursuant to
Ohio R.C. §4703.01 and 4703.19.
   (ff)   Registered Professional Engineer
      A person registered as a professional engineer pursuant to Ohio R.C.
Chapter 4733.
   (gg)   Registered Professional Surveyor
      A person registered as a professional surveyor pursuant to Ohio R.C.
Chapter 4733.
   (hh)   Special Flood Hazard Area
      Also known as "Areas of Special Flood Hazard", it is the land in the
floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given
year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood
Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH,
AO, Al-30, or A99. Special flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are
flood prone and designated from other federal state or local sources of data
including but not limited to historical flood information reflecting high water
marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils assdciated with a
watercourse.
   (ii)   Start of construction
      The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of a building.
   (jj)   Structure
      A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid storage
tank that is principally above ground.
   (kk)   Substantial Damage
      Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of
restoring the structure to the 'before damaged' condition would equal or exceed
fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   (ll)   Substantial Improvement
      Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (mm)   Variance
      A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations.
   (nn)   Violation
      The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant
with these regulations. (Ord. 10-24. Passed 3-25-24.)

Administrator shall review the application to ensure that the standards of
these regulations have been met. No floodplain development permit application
shall be reviewed until all information required in Section
1331.03(d) has been received by the Floodplain Administrator.
         B.   The Floodplain Administrator shall review all floodplain
development permit applications to assure that all necessary permits have been
received from those federal, state or local governmental agencies from which
prior approval is required. The applicant shall be responsible for obtaining
such permits as required including permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers under Section 1.0 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and Section 404 of
the Clean Water Act, and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency under Section
401 of the Clean Water Act.
      (2)   Approval. Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of a complete
application, the Floodplain Administrator shall either approve or disapprove
the application. If the Floodplain Administrator is satisfied that the
development proposed in the floodplain development application conforms to the
requirements of this ordinance, the Floodplain Administrator shall issue the
permit. All floodplain development permits shall be conditional upon the
commencement of work within 180 days. A floodplain development permit shall
expire 180 days after issuance unless the permitted activity has been
substantially begun and is thereafter pursued to completion.
   (f)   Inspections. The Floodplain Administrator shall make periodic
inspections at appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order

      (3)   Development activities undertaken by a federal agency and which are
subject to Federal Executive Order 11988-Floodplain Management.
         A.   Each federal agency has a responsibility to evaluate the
potential effects of any actions it may take in a floodplain; to ensure that
its planning programs and budget request reflect consideration of flood hazards
and floodplain management; and to prescribe procedures to implement the
policies and requirements of EO 11988.
   (k)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that City of Jaekson flood maps, studies and other data identified in
Section
1331.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood elevations or
alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or other new development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1331.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1331.03(k)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development-which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in riverine areas where FEMA has provided base flood
elevations but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1331.03(k)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or flood way delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Jackson, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)    Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Jackson have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Jackson's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Jackson
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Jackson suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the City of Jackson has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (l)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1331.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (4)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this ordinance
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
   (m)   Use of Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map and/or Flood Insurance
Study Data.
      (1)   ZoneA:
         A.   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from
the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be reasonably utilized as best available
data.
         B.   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final flood
elevation determination has been provided in a Letter of Final Determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
      (2)   Zones AE, Al-30, AH, and AO:
         A.   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
            1.   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
            2.   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not
be used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or
until all appeals have been resolved.
         B.    If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section
1331.04(i)(2) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the
best data available.
      (3)   Zones B, C, and X:
         A.   Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIRM or FIS are
not required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the effective FIRM
which are being revised to Zone AE, Al-30, AH, or AO. Communities are

      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one (1.0) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1331.04(i)(1)B. items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Jackson specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1331.03(k)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

the applicant, and be filed with 1he Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of
the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information in which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing.use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the heating.
      (3)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In ccnsidering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause,
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the vaxiance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1331.05(d)(3)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Jackson County Court of Common Pleas,
pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
(Ord. 10-24. Passed 3-25-24.)

   The subdivider and/or developer shall construct all necessary facilities
including underground pipe, inlets, catch basins, or open drainage ditches, and
retaining basins as determined by the Director of Public Service/Safety to
provide for the adequate disposal of surface water and maintenance of natural
drainage courses. The velocity of flow on an open ditch shall not exceed four
feet per second in soil ditches or six feet per second in turf gutters. Paved
gutters will be required if velocities of flow are greater than those
specified, or if it is likely otherwise that destructive erosion will result.
Drainage ditches shall not be permitted to discharge into any sanitary sewer
facility. Retaining basins shall be designed in accordance with Standard Design
Practice. A complete copy of all drainage calculations, performed and sealed by
a professional engineer registered in the State of Ohio, shall be furnished to

with such storm sewer line. If such a storm sewer system is not accessible,
natural drainage channels with easements of adequate width shall be provided,
as determined by the City Engineer. Paved gutters or storm sewers shall be
required if velocities of flow are greater than specified in Section
1337.01 or cause destructive erosion, or if curbs and gutters are required.
Storm drainage, including drain tile around basements, shall not be permitted
to discharge into any sanitary sewer facility, but shall connect to an adequate
drainage outlet. The developer shall furnish a drainage analysis to show that
the post development conditions do not exceed the drainage discharge flow or
velocity experienced prior to the proposed development for a twenty-five year,
twenty-four hour storm event. Engineering calculations shall be provided by a
professional engineer registered in the State of Ohio and shall be furnished to
the City Engineer.
(Ord. 18-01. Passed 5-14-01.)

bridges and/or culverts constructed. Where culverts are required, minimum
requirements shall be observed as follows:
   (a)   The length of a culvert, the cover over the culvert, and its capacity
shall be determined by the City Engineer. The minimum diameter of the culvert
pipe shall be twelve inches. Depending on the existing drainage conditions,
head walls may be required.
   (b)   Where driveway culverts are wholly or partially in the street right of
way, they shall have a minimum length of twenty feet and a minimum diameter of
twelve inches. The driveway culverts shall be laid so as to maintain the flow
