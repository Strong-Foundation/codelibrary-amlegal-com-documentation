   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
Council;
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF MAYFIELD VILLAGE, OHIO,
THAT:
   Section 1. The Ordinances of Mayfield Village, Ohio, of a general and
permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated into

any provision of the Codified Ordinances as adopted herein, are hereby repealed
as of the effective date of this Ordinance, except as follows:
    (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective data of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.
   (b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)    The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

      (2)    The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property.
      (3)    The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee

the Codified Ordinances along with a copy of this Ordinance in the Village
Hall. Each section of the Codified Ordinances without a previous ordinance or
resolution history, or containing a subsection with the words "adopting
ordinance", at the end thereof indicates that the section contains new matter
ordained by this Adopting Ordinance.
   Section 4. That the Council finds and determines that all formal actions of
this Council relating to the adoption of this Ordinance have been taken at open
meetings of this Council; and that deliberations of this Council and of its
committees, resulting in such formal action, took place in meetings open to the
public, in compliance with all statutory requirements including the
requirements of Section 121.22 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   Section 5. This Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the immediate preservation of the health, safety and welfare of
the residents of Mayfield Village for the reason that there exists an
imperative necessity for the earliest publication and distribution of the
Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of Mayfield Village so as to

entanglements. It shall therefore take effect immediately upon passage by the
affirmative vote of not less than four (4) members elected to Council and

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

of Ohio, all other regular full-time employees of the Municipality, other than
those serving a probationary period of employment, shall be in the classified
service.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this Charter, all regular full-
time employees of the Municipality, other than those serving a probationary
period of employment, who have been continuously employed in the service of the
Municipality in the same or similar position, for at least eight months prior
to the date such position is placed in the classified service, shall be
retained in the same or similar position in the classified service without
examination until discharged, reduced, disciplined, promoted or transferred in
accordance with this Charter or the rules and regulations of the Commission.
(Amended 11-8-05.)
      (6)    All temporary or part-time employees of the Municipality, as such
positions shall be defined by the rules and regulations established by the
Commission, shall be in the unclassified service.
(Amended 11-8-05.)
(C)   Duties of Civil Service Commission.
 
   The Commission shall provide by rule for the ascertainment of merit and
fitness as the basis for appointment and promotion in the classified service,
in the manner provided by the Constitution of the State of Ohio, and for
appeals from the action of the Mayor or from the action of any department head
in any case of transfer, reduction in rank or discharge from employment in the
classified service, except as otherwise provided in this Charter, and the
action of the Commission on any such appeal shall be final, except as provided
by law. The Commission shall keep a record of its proceedings and examinations,
which shall be open to public inspection under reasonable regulations of the
Commission, and, in all matters not in conflict with this Charter, shall
conduct its affairs in accordance with the provisions of the general law.
 
(D)   Probationary Employees.
 
   All original and promotional appointments of all employees of the
Municipality shall be for a probationary period of one year, and no appointment
or promotion of an employee is final until such employee has satisfactorily
served the employee's probationary period. If the service of a probationary
employee is unsatisfactory, the employee may be removed or reduced at any time
during such probationary period by the appointing authority. (Amended 11-3-15.)
 
(E)   Promotions.
 
   The position of Chief of Police, Chief of Fire, and Assistant Chief of Fire,
when a vacancy occurs, shall be filled by promotion from among persons holding
positions in the supervisory ranks below, providing that there are two or more
persons in such next lower rank who are willing to take the examination and are
qualified pursuant to standards as determined by the Civil Service Commission.
In the event there are not two persons willing to compete for such examination
from the supervisory ranks below, then the Commission has the authority to
permit competition for such appointment from the next lower rank (patrol
officer in the Police Department and firefighters in the Fire Department), as
well as to include competition from qualified individuals outside the
Department as determined by the Civil Service Commission. The intent being to
provide promotions from supervisory ranks, and to provide flexibility to go
outside the department once supervisory ranks are no longer capable of
providing 2 qualified and willing candidates.
   No positions, except the position of Chief of Police, Chief of Fire, and
Assistant Chief of Fire, above the rank of patrol officer in the Police
Department or Firefighter in the Fire Department shall be filled by original
appointment. Vacancies in positions above the rank of patrol officer or
firefighter shall be filled by promotion from among persons holding positions
in a rank lower than the position to be filled in the respective department.
Promotion shall be by successive ranks so far as practicable. No person in
either the Police Department or the Fire Department shall be eligible to take
an examination for promotion to a position in a higher rank unless the person
has served at least twenty-four (24) months in the next lower rank, provided in
those cases where there are less than two persons in such next lower rank who
have served twenty-four (24) months, therein and are willing to take the
examination, the twenty-four (24) month service requirement shall not apply. If
the nonapplication of the twenty-four (24) month service requirement to persons
in the next lower rank does not produce two (2) persons eligible and willing to
compete, then the same method shall be followed by going to successively lower
ranks until two (2) or more persons are eligible and willing to compete in an
examination for the vacancy. In the event two (2) persons are unwilling to
compete for such examination, then the one (1) person who is willing to compete
shall be appointed to fill the vacancy after passing a qualifying examination.
   Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (E) of
Article V, Section 6, of this Charter, all promotions of employees within the
classified service shall be made in accordance with the general laws. (Amended
11-3-15; 11-3-20.)

SECTION 12.1. COUNCIL ZONING POWERS.
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charter
Article V Section 12.1 was repealed by the voters November 7, 1995.)

   Nominations for elective offices of the Municipality shall be made only by
petition, signed by registered electors of the Municipality, not less in number
than two percent (2%) of the number voting in the Municipality at the last
preceding general election, and shall be accompanied by the written acceptance
of the nominee. The nomination of each candidate shall be made by a separate
petition, but such petition may be circulated in separate parts, which shall be
filed, however, as one instrument. No primary election shall be held for the
selection of any candidate for any elective office of the Municipality; and no
nomination for any such office shall be of any effect unless made as required
by this Article. The ballot used in the election of officers of the
Municipality shall be without party mark or designation. The names of all
candidates for any municipal office shall be placed upon the same ballot and
shall be rotated in the manner provided by the Laws of Ohio. Except as
otherwise provided in this Charter, the Laws of Ohio shall govern the
nomination and election of the elective officers of the Municipality. Any
matter which, by the terms of this Charter, may be submitted to the electors at
a special election, may be submitted at the time of a primary or general
election.
   ARTICLE VII
   INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM AND RECALL
SECTION 1. INITIATIVE.
   The electors shall have the power to propose any ordinance or resolution,
except an ordinance appropriating money or authorizing the levy of taxes, and
to adopt or reject the same at the polls, such power being known as the
initiative. An initiated ordinance or resolution shall be submitted to Council
by a petition signed in ink by qualified electors equal in number to at least
ten percent (10%) of the total vote cast at the last regular municipal
election, which petition shall be filed with the Clerk of Council. Within
twenty (20) days after any such petition has been filed, the Clerk of Council
shall determine the sufficiency of the petition, and if found sufficient, shall
certify the same to the Council. Thereafter, the Council shall take final
action, either enacting, amending, or rejecting the proposed ordinance or
resolution, within forty (40) days after it has been certified sufficient by
the Clerk of Council. If, within such forty (40) days, Council fails to pass
such proposed ordinance or resolution or passes it in some form different from
that set forth in the petition therefore, the petitioners, through the
Committee named on such petition may, at the next regular meeting of Council,
request in writing that it be submitted to a vote of the electors. Thereupon,
Council shall provide for submitting the petitioned ordinance or resolution to
the electors at the next general or regular scheduled primary or special
municipal election occurring more than seventy-five (75) days after the
certification of such petition by the Clerk; but if such petition is signed in
ink by qualified electors equal in number to at least twenty percent (20%) of
the total votes cast at the last regular municipal election, the date of the
election may be fixed therein, which may be a special election to be held at
any time more than seventy-five (75) days after the certification of such
petition by the Clerk and within eight (8) months after such certification. If
the Clerk of Council shall find any such petition insufficient, the Clerk of
Council shall, within twenty (20) days after the filing thereof, certify the
particulars in which the petition is defective, deliver a copy of the Clerk's
certificate to the Committee named on such petition, return the entire petition
to such Committee, and make a record of such delivery. Such Committee may
thereafter take steps to make such petition sufficient, and may refile the
same, as an originally filed petition, with the Clerk of Council at any time
within one year after the date of the first filing thereof. (Amended 11-3-94.)
SECTION 2. REFERENDUM.
   Within thirty (30) days after the enactment by Council, of any ordinance or
resolution which is subject to a referendum under the laws of the State of
Ohio, unless modified by this Charter, a petition signed in ink by qualified
electors equal in number to no less than ten percent (10%) of the total votes
cast at the last regular municipal election, may be filed with the Council, by
filing the same with the Clerk of Council, requesting the ordinance or
resolution be repealed, or submitted to a vote of the electors. Within ten (10)
days after said petition is filed, the Clerk of Council shall determine the
sufficiency of the petition, and if found sufficient, shall certify the same to
the Council. Thereafter, the Council shall, within thirty (30) days after the
certification of such petition by the Clerk of Council, reconsider such
ordinance or resolution. If Council fails to repeal said ordinance or
resolution within such thirty (30) days the Council shall provide for
submitting it to a vote of the electors at the next general or regularly
scheduled primary or special municipal election occurring more than seventy-
five (75) days after the certification of such petition by the Clerk; but if
such petition is signed by qualified electors equal in number to at least
twenty percent (20%) of the total votes cast at the last regular municipal
election, the date of the election may be fixed therein, which may be a special
election to be held at any time more than seventy-five (75) days after the
certification of such petition by the Clerk and within seven (7) months after
such certification. If the Clerk of Council shall find any such petition
insufficient, the Clerk of Council shall, within ten (10) days after the filing
thereof, certify the particulars in which the petition is defective, deliver a
copy of the Clerk's certificate to the Committee named on such petition, return
the entire petition to such Committee, and make a record of such delivery. Such
Committee shall be allowed a period of ten (10) days after the date on which
such delivery is made to take steps to make such petition sufficient, and may
refile the same, as an originally filed petition with the Clerk of Council,
within such ten (10) day period. (Amended 11-3-94.)
SECTION 3. PETITION PROCEDURE.
   A nominating, initiative, referendum or recall petition may be circulated in
separate parts, but the separate parts shall be bound together and filed as one
instrument. Each part shall contain in the case of the initiative or
referendum, a full and correct copy of the title and text of the proposed or
objectionable ordinance or resolution, and in the case of the recall, the name
and office of the person whose removal is sought and a statement in not more
than two hundred (200) words of the grounds for the removal.
 
   Each separate part of said petition shall be either printed or typewritten
and shall bear the names of at least five (5) registered electors who shall be
officially regarded as filing the petition and shall constitute the
Petitioners' Committee for the purpose named therein.
 
   Each separate part of such petition shall bear an affidavit sworn to by the
circulator thereof stating the number of signers to such part of the petition,
and that each signature thereon is the genuine signature of the person whose
name it purports to be and was submitted in the presence of the affiant.
   Each signer of a petition referred to shall sign the person's name in ink or
indelible pencil and shall place on the petition paper after the signer's name,
the signer's place of residence by street and number.
SECTION 4. SUSPENSION.
   No ordinance or resolution upon which a referendum is requested shall go
into effect, unless it be an emergency ordinance or resolution, until the
referendum action thereon fails or is abandoned or until approved by a majority
of those voting thereon.
SECTION 5. MEASURES SUBJECT TO REFERENDUM.
   When the Council, by law or under provisions of general ordinances, is
required to pass more than one ordinance or resolution necessary to make and
pay for any public improvements, the referendum provision shall apply only to
the first ordinance or resolution required to be passed and not to any
subsequent ordinances or resolutions relating thereto.
 
   Ordinances and resolutions providing for the annual tax levy or for
improvements petitioned for by the owners of a majority of the feet front or a
majority of the owners in interest of the property benefited and to be
specially assessed therefore, and appropriation ordinances limited to the
subject of appropriations, shall not be subject to referendum; but all other
ordinances and resolutions, including emergency ordinances shall be subject to
referendum.
 
   Ordinances or resolutions submitted to the Council by initiative petition
and passed by the Council either with or without change, but not required to be
submitted to a vote of the electors, shall be subject to referendum in the same
manner as other ordinances or resolutions.
SECTION 6. EFFECT OF REFERENDUM ON EMERGENCY MEASURES.
   Emergency ordinances and resolutions shall go into effect at the time
indicated therein, notwithstanding that a referendum may be filed against them.
 
   If, when submitted to a vote of the electors, an emergency measure be not
approved by a majority of those voting thereon, it shall be considered repealed
as of the date of the certification of the vote thereon, but such measure shall
be deemed sufficient authority for payment, in accordance with the measure, of
any expense incurred previous to the referendum vote thereon.
SECTION 7. RECALL.
   The electors shall have the power to remove from office by a recall election
any elected officer of the Municipality. If an elected officer shall have
served for six months of the officer's term, a petition demanding the officer's
removal may be filed with the Clerk of Council who shall note thereon the name
and address of the persons constituting the Petitioners' Committee filing the
petition and the date of such filing. Such petition shall be signed by at least
that number of qualified electors which equals twenty percent (20%) of the
total electors voting at the last preceding regular municipal election. Within
ten (10) days after the day on which such petition shall have been filed, the
Clerk shall determine whether or not it meets the requirements hereof. If the
Clerk shall find the petition insufficient, the Clerk shall within ten (10)
days after the date of filing thereof, certify the particulars in which the
petition is defective, deliver a copy of the Clerk's certificate to the
Committee who filed the petition with the Clerk, and make a record of such
delivery. Such Committee shall be allowed a period of ten (10) days after the
date on which such delivery was made to take steps to make such petition
sufficient, and may refile the same, as an originally filed petition with the
Clerk of Council within such ten (10) day period. If the Clerk shall find the
petition sufficient, the Clerk shall within ten (10) days after the date of
filing thereof, so certify to the Council, shall deliver a copy of such
certificate to the officer whose removal is sought, and shall make a record of
such delivery. If such officer shall not resign within five (5) days after the
day on which such delivery shall have been made, the Council shall thereupon
fix a day for holding a special recall election, not less than thirty (30) nor
more than forty-five (45) days after the date of such delivery. At such recall
election this question shall be placed on the ballot: "Shall (naming the
officer) be removed from office as (naming the office) of Mayfield Village?"
with provision on the ballot for voting affirmatively or negatively on such
question. If a majority of the votes cast at such election shall be voted
negatively, such officer shall remain in office. If a majority of the votes
cast shall be voted affirmatively, such officer shall be considered as removed,
the office shall be deemed vacant, and such vacancy shall be filled as provided
in this Charter. The officer removed by such election shall not be eligible for
appointment to the vacancy created thereby.
   ARTICLE VIII
   FRANCHISES
   The Council may by ordinance grant a franchise to any person, firm or
corporation to construct or operate a public utility on, across, under, over or
above any public street or real estate within the Municipality, for a period
not in excess of twenty-five (25) years; and it may prescribe in the ordinance
the kind or quality of service or product to be furnished, the rate to be
charged therefore, and such other terms as Council shall deem conducive to the
public interest. Such franchise may be amended or renewed in the manner and
subject to the provisions established by this Charter for original grants. No
consent of the owner of property abutting on any public street or real estate
shall be necessary to the effectiveness of any such grant, amendment or
renewal. All such grants, amendments and renewals shall be made subject to the
continuing right of the Council to provide reasonable regulations for the
operation of such utilities with reference to such streets and public real
estate, including the right to require such reconstruction, relocation,
alteration or removal of structures and equipment used in such streets or
public realty as shall, in the opinion of Council, be necessary in the public
interest.
   ARTICLE IX
   FINANCES AND TAXATION
SECTION 1. GENERAL.
   The laws of the State of Ohio relating generally to budgets, appropriations,
deposits, expenditures, debts, bonds, and other fiscal matters of the
Municipality shall be applicable to the Municipality, except as modified by or
necessarily inconsistent with the provisions of this Charter or the provisions
of the Constitution of the State of Ohio.
SECTION 2. LIMITATIONS ON RATE OF TAXATION.
   The power of Council to levy taxes shall be subject to the limitations now
or hereafter provided by the Constitution and the general laws of the State of
Ohio and nothing contained in this Charter shall be construed as authorizing
the levy of any taxes in excess of such limitation without a vote of the
people.
   ARTICLE X
AMENDMENTS TO CHARTER
   The Council may, by vote of at least two-thirds of its members, submit to
the electors of the Municipality of Mayfield Village amendments to this
Charter, or upon a petition, in the form as provided in
 Section 3 of Article VII, signed by ten percent (10%) of the registered
electors of this Municipality setting forth any proposed amendment, such
proposed amendment shall be so submitted to the electors by the Council.
 
   The submission of any proposed amendment to the electors shall be governed
by the requirements of the Constitution of the State of Ohio, and, to such
extent as said Constitution shall fail to provide therefore, the Council shall
determine the manner for such submission. Any proposed amendment to this
Charter shall be submitted to the electors at the next general election or any
regularly scheduled primary election in the Municipality.
 
   If any such amendment is approved by a majority of the electors voting
thereon, it shall become a part of this Charter; except that if two or more
inconsistent amendments on the same subject are submitted at the same election,
only the one of such amendments receiving the largest affirmative vote, not
less than a majority shall become a part of this Charter. (Amended 5-8-84.)

Such commission shall review the Charter, and within five calendar months after
such appointment, shall have a review session with the Mayor and Council and

delivery will not cause invalidation of any amendment by the voters.

of a professional consultant are required for their review of the Charter, they
may retain such services and the reasonable costs thereof shall be paid by the
Village. (Amended 11-7-00.)

originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:

reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
   101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
   101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

   103.05 EXEMPTIONS FOR EXECUTIVE SESSIONS.
   This chapter shall not apply to a meeting, or such portion thereof, which
may be called to discuss public business for which notice is specifically
exempted by Ohio R.C. 121.22(G), as follows:
   (a)    The members of a public body may hold an executive session only at a
regular or special meeting for the sole purpose of the consideration of any of
the following matters:
      (1)    Unless the public employee, official, licensee or regulated
individual requests a public hearing to consider the appointment, employment,
dismissal, discipline, promotion, demotion or compensation of a public employee
or official, or the investigation of charges or complaints against a public
employee, official, licensee or regulated individual, except as otherwise
provided by law, no public body shall hold an executive session for the
discipline of an elected official for conduct related to the performance of his
official duties or for his removal from office.
      (2)    To consider the purchase of property for public purposes, or for
the sale of property at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of
information would give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a
person whose personal, private interest is adverse to the general public
interest. No member shall use this division as a subterfuge for providing
covert information to prospective buyers or sellers. A purchase or sale of
public property is void if the seller or buyer of the public property has
received covert information from a member that has not been disclosed to the
general public in sufficient time for other prospective buyers and sellers to
prepare and submit offers. If the minutes of the public body show that all
meetings and deliberations of the public body have been conducted in compliance
with this section, any instrument executed by the public body purporting to
convey, lease, or otherwise dispose of any right, title or interest in any
public property shall be conclusively presumed to have been executed in
compliance with this section insofar as title or other interest of any bona
fide purchasers, lessees or transferees of the property is concerned.

disputes involving the public body that are the subject of pending or imminent
court action.
      (4)    Preparing for, conducting or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment.
      (5)    Matters required to be kept confidential by Federal law or rules
or State statutes.
      (6)    Specialized details of security arrangements where disclosure of
the matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the
purpose of committing or avoiding prosecution for a violation of the law.
         (Ord. 76-6. Passed 2-16-76.)

122.05    Time allowed and procedure for rehearing.
122.06    Findings of fact and conclusions of law.
   122.01 BOARD'S STANDARD.
   (a)   The Board shall not grant a variance or exception to the zoning
regulations or building code, unless the applicant has shown that the literal
application of the zoning or building code would result in practical
difficulties as a result of some peculiar or unique condition or circumstance
pertaining to the zoning lot in question.
   (b)   The seven (7) non-exclusive factors to consider whether practical
difficulties exist are as follows:
      (1)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return, or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance
being requested;
      (2)   Whether the variance is substantial;
      (3)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial determinant as a result of the variance;
      (4)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental service;
      (5)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restriction;
      (6)   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some other method other than a variance; and
      (7)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.   
         (Ord. 2022-23. Passed 12-19-22.)
   122.02 RIGHT TO APPEAL.
   After the Board has rendered its decision on a particular case, any

Section
 1105.02(d), and Article 4, Section 12(A) of the Village's Charter, Council may
review the transcript and minutes of the Board hearing, or have a rehearing in
front of Council, and may affirm the decision of the Board, or with a two-
thirds (2/3rd) majority vote of all members elected or appointed, modify or
reverse the decision.
(Ord. 2022-23. Passed 12-19-22.)
   122.04 ABUSE OF DISCRETION STANDARD OF REVIEW.
   Council, whether reviewing the transcript or having a rehearing, shall
consider an appeal of a decision of the Board based upon an abuse of discretion
standard i.e., by deciding whether the Board's decision when it applied the
standard in Section
122.01 was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. When applying an abuse
of discretion standard, Council may not substitute its judgment for that of the
Board. The decision of the Board shall be affirmed by Council if Council finds
there is any reasonable basis for the Board's decision.
(Ord. 2022-23. Passed 12-19-22.)
   122.05 TIME ALLOWED AND PROCEDURE FOR REHEARING.
   Unless otherwise determined, if a rehearing is held, the rehearing shall be
held as part of a regular meeting(s) of Council and all testimony before
Council shall be given under oath or affirmation, which shall be administered
by a person qualified to administer oaths. The rehearing shall proceed as
follows:
   (a)   Appellant (persons in support of the appeal) and any aggrieved party
(persons appearing in opposition to the appeal) shall be permitted a total of
fifteen (15) minutes each, which includes ten (10) minutes for the presentation
of evidence, statements and arguments and five (5) minutes for rebuttal and a
brief closing statement, at the public hearing before Council. In addition,
Council may permit:
      (1)    A reasonable amount of additional time for cross-examination and
redirect examination of Appellant's witnesses.
      (2)    A reasonable amount of additional time for cross-examination and
redirect examination of any aggrieved party's witnesses.
      (3)    The administration, including the Building Commissioner and his or
her staff, may be given a reasonable amount of time by the President of Council
for the presentation of any information that may be necessary to the appeal.
   (b)    The President of Council shall have the authority to deter
repetitious and irrelevant testimony and shall, unless otherwise directed by a
simple majority of Council, have authority to extend the time periods specified
above, when it is appropriate and in the interest of affording a fair hearing
to all interested parties.
   (c)    By majority vote, Council may waive the requirements of this section
in order to conduct a hearing in a manner appropriate for Council to fairly
consider the appeal.
      (Ord. 2022-23. Passed 12-19-22.)
   122.06 FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW.
   If, by a two-thirds (2/3rd) vote of all members elected or appointed,
Council votes to modify or overturn the decision of the Board, Council shall
issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law. Or, Council shall
prepare written findings of fact and conclusions of law if, prior to closing
the rehearing, the Appellant, or an aggrieved party requests Council make
written findings of fact and conclusions of law. In such event, Council shall
direct the Village's Law Director to draft a resolution setting forth the
factual and legal basis on which Council has found an abuse of discretion,
which findings shall be considered and adopted by resolution at a subsequent
regular meeting of Council.

deemed to be held in trust by the person required to collect the same until
paid to the Finance Director as herein provided. Any person required to collect
the tax imposed under this chapter who fails to collect the same, or having
collected the tax, fails to remit the tax to the Finance Director in the manner
prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure is the result of his own act
or the result of acts or conditions beyond his control, shall nevertheless be
personally liable to the Municipality for the amount of such tax, and shall,
unless the remittance is made as herein required, be guilty of a violation of
this section. The tax imposed hereunder shall be collected at the time the
lodging charge is paid by the transient guest seeking lodging in a hotel and
shall be reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the Finance
Director in monthly installments and remittance therefor on or before the
thirtieth day of the month next succeeding the end of the monthly period in
which the tax is collected or received. Payment or remittance of the tax
collected may be made by check, unless payment or remittance is otherwise
required by the Finance Director, but payment by check shall not relieve the
person collecting the tax from liability for payment and remittance of the tax
to the Finance Director unless the check is honored and is in the full and
correct amount. The person receiving any payment for lodgings from a transient
guest shall make out a return upon such forms and setting forth such
information as the Finance Director may require, showing the amount of the tax
upon lodgings for which he is liable for the preceding monthly period, and
shall sign and transmit the same to the Finance Director with a remittance for
such amount. The Finance Director may in his discretion require verified annual
returns from any person receiving lodging payments setting forth such
additional information as he may deem necessary to determine correctly the
amount of tax collected and payable. Failure to comply with any requirement of
the Finance Director as to report and remittance of the tax as required shall
be a violation of this section.
   The books, records and accounts of any person collecting the tax herein
levied shall, as to lodging and tax collections, be at all reasonable times
subject to examination and audit by the Finance Director. If the tax imposed by
this chapter is not paid when due there shall be added, as part of the tax,
interest at the rate of one percent per month from the time when the tax became
due until paid.

   (a)    On all taxable income earned on and after January 1, 1972, by

profits earned on and after January 1, 1972, of all resident unincorporated
business entities or professions or other activities, derived from sales made,
work done, services performed or rendered and business or other activities
conducted in the Municipality.
      (2)    On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits earned

DETERMINATION OF TAX
   175.0701 METHOD OF DETERMINATION.
   (a)   In the taxation of income which is subject to the municipal income
tax, the portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer to be allocated as
having been derived from within the Municipality shall be determined as
follows:
      (1)   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage
to be determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll and sales, each
of which shall be given equal weight as follows:
         A.   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Municipality during the taxable period to the average net book value of all the
real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used in
subsection (a)(1)A. hereof, real property includes property rented or leased by
the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by multiplying
the annual rental thereon by eight.
         B.   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Municipality to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the
same period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed.
         C.   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Municipality to gross
receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales and
services, whenever made or performed.
      (2)   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce
an equitable result, the Administrator may approve the use of books and records
as a substitute method, by applying the following:
         A.   The net profits allocable to the Municipality from business,
profession or other activities conducted in the Municipality by corporations or
unincorporated entities (whether resident or non- resident) may be determined
from the records of the taxpayer only if the taxpayer has bona fide records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of his net profits is
attributable to that part of his activities conducted within the Municipality.
         B.   If the books and records of the taxpayer are used as the basis
for apportioning net profits, a statement must accompany the return explaining
the manner in which such apportionment is made in sufficient detail to enable
the Administrator to determine whether the net profits attributable to the
Municipality are apportioned with reasonable accuracy.
         C.   In determining the income allocable to the Municipality from the
books and records of a taxpayer, an adjustment may be made for the contribution
made to the production of such income by headquarters activities of the
taxpayer, whether such headquarters is within or without the Municipality.
            (Ord. 2005-05. Passed 1-24-05.)
   175.0702 SALES MADE IN THE MUNICIPALITY DEFINED.

stock of goods within the Municipality.

Municipality regardless of where title passes, even though transported from a
point outside the Municipality, if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through
its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
Municipality and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
   (c)    All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a place
within the Municipality to purchasers outside of the Municipality, regardless
of where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees,
regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where
delivery is made.
      (Ord. 1021. Passed 8-21-67.)
   175.0703 TOTAL ALLOCATION.
   Add together the percentages determined in accordance with subsections (a),
(b), and (c) of Section
175.0701 or such of the aforesaid percentages as are applicable to the
particular taxpayer and divide the total so obtained by the number of
percentages used in deriving the total in order to obtain the business
allocation percentage referred to in Section
175.0701.
   A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or
outside the Municipality.
(Ord. 1021. Passed 8-21-67.)
   175.0704 RENTALS.
   Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the computation of
net profits from business activities under subsections (c), (d) and (e) of
Section
175.0501, only if and to the extent that the rental, ownership, management or
operations of the real estate from which such rentals are derived (whether so
rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or through agents or
other representatives) constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole
or in part.
   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties regardless of
number and value, aggregates in excess of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the rental, ownership,
management or operation of such properties is a business activity of such
taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to tax.
   In the case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered engaged in
a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or fluctuating
percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the lessee, whether or
not such rental exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month.
   In the case of farm property, the owner shall be considered engaged in a
business activity when he shares in crops or when the rental is based on a
percentage of the gross or net receipts derived from the farm, whether or not
the gross income exceeds the two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month.
   The person who operates a licensed rooming house shall be considered in
business whether or not the gross income exceeds two hundred fifty dollars

(Ord. 71-50. Passed 12-20-71.)
   175.0705 OPERATING LOSS CARRY-FORWARD.
   (a)    The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year

taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:

   The income tax levied by the Village at a rate of two percent (2%) is levied
on the Municipal Taxable Income of every person residing in and/or earning and/
or receiving income in the Village.
Individuals.
   (A)    For residents of the Village, the income tax levied herein shall be
on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. This
is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
176.02 (C)(16)).
   (B)    For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages,
commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
   (C)    For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to "Municipal
Taxable Income" as defined in Section
176.02 (C)(21). Exemptions which may apply are specified in Section

Refundable credit for Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan.
   (D)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    "Qualifying loss" means the amount of compensation attributable
to a taxpayer's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the receipt of
money and property attributable to distributions from the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of money and
property is made by the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The taxpayer
sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the taxpayer
receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   (i)    "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for
the taxable year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to the Village with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            (ii)    If different tax rates applied for different taxable years,
then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the Village
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (d)    "Refundable credit" means the amount of the Village income tax
that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    If, in addition to the Village, a taxpayer has paid tax to other
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal
corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's
proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the
Village for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
      (4)    The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         (a)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         (b)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
Domicile.
   (E)   (1)   (a)    An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the Village
for all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the
Village on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if the Tax
Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in the
Village for all or part of the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described
in division (E)(1)(a) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Village for all or part of the taxable year.
      (2)    For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled
in the Village for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be
considered include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)    The individual's domicile in other taxable years;
         (b)    The location at which the individual is registered to vote;
         (c)    The address on the individual's driver's license;
         (d)    The location of real estate for which the individual claimed a
property tax exemption or reduction allowed on the basis of the individual's
residence or domicile;
         (e)    The location and value of abodes owned or leased by the
individual;
         (f)    Declarations, written or oral, made by the individual regarding
the individual's residency;
         (g)    The primary location at which the individual is employed.
         (h)    The location of educational institutions attended by the
individual's dependents as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code,
to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
         (i)    The number of contact periods the individual has with the
Village. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact
period" with the Village if the individual is away overnight from the
individual's abode located outside of the Village and while away overnight from
that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in the Village.
      (3)    All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations.
Businesses.
   (F)    This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the Village, unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in
the Village or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745. of the ORC.
      (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (F)(2) and (G) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         (a)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
176.04 (C);
         (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Village to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same
period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Village, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of
the Village may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
176.12 (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
176.12 (A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)    As used in division (F)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         (a)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            (i)    The employer;
            (ii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or
a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            (iii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person
described in (F)(3)(a)(ii) of this section, or a related member of such a
vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)    For the purposes of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, receipts
from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:
         (a)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property
shall be sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where
title passes, the property meets either of the following criteria:
            (i)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the Village
from a stock of goods located within the Village.
            (ii)    The property is delivered within the Village from a
location outside the Village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
Village and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
         (b)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
the Village to the extent that such services are performed in the Village.
         (c)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the Village.
         (d)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the
Village.
         (e)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the Village.
      (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual shall be subject to the Village's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the Village or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the Village.
The Village shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for
the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the
municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the Village, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the
Village to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real
estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the Village shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for the Village. The individual may claim a credit for taxes
the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under the Village's income tax ordinance.
      (7)    When calculating the ratios described in division (F)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (8)    Intentionally left blank.
      (9)    Intentionally left blank.
   (G)   (1)   As used in this division:
         (a)   “Qualifying remote employee or owner” means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.   
            (ii)   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)   “Qualifying remote work location” means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
“Qualifying remote work location” may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)   “Reporting location” means either of the following:
            (i)   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer
or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under Section
176.04 of this chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)   “Qualifying reporting location” means one of the following:
            (i)   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee’s or owner’s supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee’s or owner’s
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer’s business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer’s net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the Tax Administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
Tax Administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee’s or owner’s qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee’s or
owner’s activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee’s or owner’s qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under
this division after properly revoking a prior election.
(3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (F)(1) of
this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual’s qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual’s qualifying reporting location.
         (b)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual’s
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual’s
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual’s
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual’s
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
Tax Administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a Tax Administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee’s or owner’s qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
 176.04 of this chapter.
          (Ord. 2015-23. Passed 10-19-15; Ord. 2018-16. Passed 3-19-18; Ord.
2023-15. Passed 12-20-23.)
   176.04 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
Withholding provisions.
   (A)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the Village shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in the Village. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
176.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
176.03 of this ordinance, of 2%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that
the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively
pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit
of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the Village the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Village in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the Village in any month of the preceding calendar
quarter exceeded $200.
Payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to the Tax
Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month for which
the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (c)    Intentionally left blank.
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator and the Village as the
return required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax
under this ordinance is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Village income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this ordinance or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the Village the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Village income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Village during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this ordinance, to be tax required to be withheld and
remitted for the purposes of this section
Occasional Entrant - Withholding.

         (a)    "Employer" includes a person that is a related member to or of
an employer.
         (b)    "Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing business in
this state, such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar location owned
or controlled by an employer.
         (c)    "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.

event basis.
         (f)    "Public figure" means a person of prominence who performs
services at discrete events, such as speeches, public appearances, or similar
events, for wages or other remuneration on a per-event basis.
         (g)    "Worksite location" means a construction site or other
temporary worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for
more than 20 days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not
include the home of an employee.
      (2)   (a)    Subject to divisions (C)(3), (5), (6), and (7) of this
section, an employer is not required to withhold the Village income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the Village if the employee performed such services in the Village on 20 or
fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Village.
            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Village. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
Village at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a
calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than 20 days" if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:
               (a)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.
            (iii)    The employee is a resident of the Village and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
176.04.
            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the Village than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee
spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)    Traveling from any location to another location in order
to pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property
that has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            (iv)    Transporting or delivering property described in division
(C)(2)(b)(iii) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property,
the employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real
estate owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's
employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Village exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to the Village for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in the Village.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village
under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
Village for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to
the employee for personal services performed in the Village.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the Village and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
176.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Village, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the Village.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
176.04.

   176.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)    An annual Village income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every individual taxpayer eighteen (18) years of age or older and any taxpayer
that is not an individual for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is
subject to the tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
176.04 when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income subject to the
tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, and no additional tax is due the Village.
      (2)    Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for Village income tax
purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which
retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the Village, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
ordinance.
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.

be completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent, guardian,
conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the person or
property of that individual.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)     The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or, in
the case of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation,
Ohio form IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other
documentation necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return.
An individual taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section
electronically is not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing
to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies
after the return has been filed.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Village to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)   (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the
return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic
forms, together with remittance made payable to the Village . No remittance is

      (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Village's income tax
return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended
due date of the Village’s income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an
individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of
the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file
under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless
the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Village's income tax return.
         (b)     A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's Village income tax return. If
the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the
Village income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the
taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
Village's income tax return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Village, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (3) or (4) of this section, the Tax
Administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
If a Tax Administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the municipal
corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to
respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension received under
division (G)(2) of this section if the Tax Administrator has actual knowledge
that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive
the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or failed to file for an
extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Village shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Village an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section,
unless the provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the Village income tax ordinance
for a taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)   The person was required to file a tax return with the Village
for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location (as defined in Section 4(C)(1)(g)) within the
Village.
            (ii)   The person no longer provides services in the Village and
does not expect to be subject to Village income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the Village. The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within the Village, make any sales in the Village, or otherwise become subject
to the tax levied by the Village during the taxable year. If the affiant does
become subject to the tax levied by the Village for the taxable year, the
affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer
with Village income tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The person shall
sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)(b)
the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return for
the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)   Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the the Village by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
176.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the Village, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the Village and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Village to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Village, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the
Village or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this
ordinance and of the Village's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the

extension for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of
amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)    Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the Village
for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time
for payment of taxes required by the Village during the period of the member's
or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   
   (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this ordinance. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)    For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.

purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.

Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Village's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.

binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by a taxpayer under division (S)(1) or
(2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election is made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code
is terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code
is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Village income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the Village. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated
Village income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated Village
income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer
requests and receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a
separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Village income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States department of treasury

   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
176.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
176.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
176.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
176.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
176.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to Village income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this ordinance on the basis
of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Village income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
176.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the Village in accordance with this ordinance on
the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for
any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an
affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   176.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the Village who is required to
and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this ordinance may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed the tax due the Village under this ordinance.
   (B)    The Village shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Village who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it grants
a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (D)    Intentionally left blank.

   176.07 ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the Village's income tax for
the current taxable year.
      (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the Village for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for the Village from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the Village in equal amounts on each payment date unless
the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld,
in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the
amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
176.05 or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Village,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability
for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)     For an individual, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of
the first month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year. For a person other than an individual, on or
before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of the taxable year,
ninety percent (90%) of the taxable liability for the taxable year.  
      (2)    When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section 718.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
176.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Village under Section
176.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village but was
not domiciled here on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

   176.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS. 
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this ordinance. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.

   176.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS. 
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
176.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars or more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
176.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
176.18 (A)(4).

   176.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR
REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the Village, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the Village as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village is subject to recovery by the Village. If
the Village's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the Village
shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the Village
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (C)    If the Village's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Village's tax rate. However, if the Village's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to the Village, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2015-23. Passed 10-19-15; Ord. 2023-15. Passed 12-20-23.)
   176.11 AMENDED RETURNS. 
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the Village changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal
or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
Village. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
176.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of
Section
176.12 for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the Village. A request filed under this division shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
176.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.   
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to the
Village income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Village income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars.

limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
176.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or

   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the

the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
176.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
176.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover Village income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:

shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of

Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic

   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Village official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.

   176.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village that arises pursuant to the Village's income tax imposed in
accordance with this ordinance.
   (B)    Nothing in this ordinance prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-23. Passed 10-19-15; Ord. 2023-15. Passed 12-20-23.)
   176.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this ordinance is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village as
authorized by this ordinance. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this ordinance and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Village from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-23. Passed 10-19-15; Ord. 2023-15. Passed 12-20-23.)
   176.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Village ordinance or state law
to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Village or the Tax Administrator.

         (b)    Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required

      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing

before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the municipality to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be

   176.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)    Nothing in this ordinance shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the ORC:
      (1)   (a)    Exercise all powers whatsoever of an query nature as
provided by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records,
memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         (b)    The powers referred to in this division of this section shall
be exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance
of the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the
Village's income tax ordinance;
      (2)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)    Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and
states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)    Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax
Administrator finds that there has been an overpayment, make a written
statement of the Tax Administrator's findings, and approve and issue a refund

provided in this ordinance;
      (5)    Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to

computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made.
         (b)    If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-
determine, or correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order
which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the
withholding obligations described in Section

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
ordinance for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if
no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this ordinance. Upon
written request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
      (2)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or
other person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is
subject to, the provisions of this ordinance shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the Village or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.
Identification information.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this ordinance prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this ordinance
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
176.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
176.99.
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
176.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this ordinance prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
176.18.
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
176.99 for a violation of Section
176.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

Administrator in accordance with the Rules and Regulations.
   (C)    A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (D)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.
   (E)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds the Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (F)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal.
(Ord. 2015-23. Passed 10-19-23; Ord. 2023-15. Passed 12-20-23.)

   (A)   (1)    The Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Village, but
such appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Village at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Mayor
of the Village. This member may be an employee of the Village, but may not be
the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or
other similar official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax
matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (2)    The term for members of the Board of Tax Review of the Village
shall be two years. There is no limit on the number of terms that a member may
serve if the member is reappointed by the legislative authority. The board
member appointed by the Mayor of the Village shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.
      (4)    A member of the Board of Tax Review who, for any reason, ceases to
meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
      (6)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons
why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.

   176.22 AUTHORITY TO CREATE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Nothing in this ordinance prohibits the legislative authority of the

shall not conflict with or be inconsistent with any provision of this

invalidity shall affect only such clause, sentence, section or part of this

as the Village's Income Tax Rules and Regulations. In the event of a conflict
with any provision(s) of the Village Income Tax Ordinance and the RITA Rules &
Regulations, the Ordinance will supersede. Until and if the contractual
relationship between the Village and RITA ceases, Section
176.26 will supersede all other provisions within Ordinance 2015 -23 regarding

other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee
may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in
rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items
after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the
notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if applicable. The

         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.

private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private

pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk motor
vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more than
seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to the
possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right
of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
(ORC 4513.64)
   303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(A)(2), (3), (4) and (5)
that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-
two hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, express mail, or any other commercial carrier
service utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt, to the
person having the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor
vehicle is left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor
vehicle either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable
structure or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense. (ORC 4513.65)

times the usual amount imposed for the violation upon an offender who alleges,
in an affidavit filed with the court prior to his sentencing, that the offender
is indigent and is unable to pay the fine imposed pursuant to this subsection,
provided the court determines the offender is an indigent person and is unable
to pay the fine. (ORC 4511.21)
   303.991 COMMITTING AN OFFENSE WHILE DISTRACTED PENALTY.
   (a)   As used in this section and each section of the Traffic Code where
specified, all of the following apply:
      (1)   “Distracted” means doing either of the following while operating a
vehicle:
         A.   Using an electronic wireless communications device, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, in violation of that section.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
331.42.
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
         As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a
utility.
   
   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
   313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
   313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.

      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the

Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions

or waiver of time limits by the person or entity who requested the hearing.
Notice of the hearing shall be provided by the Lyndhurst Municipal Court. The
Lyndhurst Municipal Court shall determine whether a preponderance of the
evidence establishes that a Traffic Law Violation alleged in the Ticket did in
fact occur and that the person or entity requesting the hearing is the person
who was operating the vehicle at the time of the Traffic Law Violation.
   (c)   If as a result of the adjudication of a Ticket by the Lyndhurst
Municipal Court, the Village or its designee becomes aware that the person or
entity named in the Ticket was not the person who was operating the vehicle at
the time of the violation and the Village or its designee is privy to or
receives evidence identifying a Designated Party, upon receipt of the evidence
of the identity of the Designated Party, the Village or its designee may issue
a Ticket to the Designated Party. The Village shall ensure that a Ticket issued
under this section conforms with Section
317.04. The Village or its designee shall send the Ticket by ordinary mail not
later than twenty-one (21) days after receipt of the evidence of the identity
of the Designated Party.
   (d)   If a Designated Party, who is issued a Ticket as a result of
subsection (c) above, contests the Ticket by filing a written request for a
hearing and does so not later than thirty (30) days after the mailing date of
the Ticket, the Village shall require the Registered Owner of the motor vehicle
to also attend the hearing. If at the hearing involving the Designated Party
the Lyndhurst Municipal Court cannot determine the identity of the operator of
the vehicle at the time of the violation, the Registered Owner shall be liable
for the violation. The Lyndhurst Municipal Court shall then issue a written
decision imposing liability for the violation on the Registered Owner and
submit it to the Village or its designee and to the Registered Owner. If the
Designated Party, also is a Registered Owner of the vehicle, liability for the
violation shall follow the order of Registered Owners as listed on the title to
the vehicle.
   (e)   A person or entity found liable for a Ticket may appeal the decision
rendered by the Lyndhurst Municipal Court in accordance with Ohio law.
   (f)   No decision rendered under this Section, and no admission of liability
under this Chapter is admissible as evidence in any other judicial proceeding
in this state, except as is provided in Section
317.08 hereinbelow.

   (c)   The amount of the penalty shall be paid within thirty (30) days from
the mailing date of the Ticket. If the amount of the penalty is not paid within
this time, twenty dollars ($20.00) shall be imposed as a default fee. Failure
to pay the penalty and the twenty-dollar ($20.00) default fee within sixty (60)
days from the date of the mailing of the Ticket will result in the unpaid
penalty and default fee being collected by civil suit or other appropriate
means of collection per Section
317.08 below.
(Ord. 2021-10. Passed 9-20-21.)
   317.08 COLLECTION OF CIVIL PENALTY.
   (a)   In the event that the Registered Owner or Designated Party fails to
take any action set forth in Section
317.05(a) or fails to satisfy any liability determined by the Lyndhurst
Municipal Court for the penalties established under this Chapter and the time
to appeal such decision has passed without the filing of an appeal, the Village
may seek to collect the amount due and owing and/or may initiate a civil
enforcement action in a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain a judgment
for the civil penalty and any late fees, costs and attorney's fees that may be
imposed under this Chapter and by the Lyndhurst Municipal Court.
   (b)   If a judgment for a civil penalty under this Chapter is not satisfied,
the Village may seek payment on the judgment amount, together with any
applicable interest and cost thereon, in any manner authorized by law. In

   331.01 DRIVING UPON RIGHT SIDE OF ROADWAY; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right of way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic control
device.
   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;
         C.   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the
right- hand lane to continue on the driver’s intended route.
      (2)   Nothing in subsection (b)(1) of this section requires a driver of a
slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (c)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or
except as permitted under subsection (a) (2) hereof.
   Subsection (c) hereof shall not be construed as prohibiting the crossing of
the center line in making a left turn into or from an alley, private road or
driveway.
   (d)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.25)
   331.02 PASSING TO RIGHT WHEN PROCEEDING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.
   (a)   Operators of vehicles proceeding in opposite directions shall pass

an auxiliary yellow line marked on the roadway pavement and placed parallel to
the normal center line or marked lane line. When the auxiliary yellow line
appears on the left side in the driver's lane of travel and to the right of the
normal center line or marked lane line, no driver shall drive across the
auxiliary yellow line to overtake and pass another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction. When auxiliary yellow lines appear on both sides of the normal
center line or marked lane line, drivers proceeding in either direction shall
not drive across such auxiliary yellow lines to overtake and pass another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction. No driver shall, at any other time,
drive across the yellow auxiliary line when it appears in the driver's lane of
travel, except to make a lawfully permitted left-hand turn under the rules
governing such movement. No passing signs may also be erected facing traffic to
indicate the beginning and end of each no passing zone.
   When appropriate signs or markings indicating hazardous or no passing zones
are in place and clearly visible, every operator of a vehicle shall obey the
directions of the signs or markings, notwithstanding the distance set out in

two-way movement of traffic, a vehicle shall not be driven in the center lane
except when overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway is clearly
visible and such center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or
when preparing for a left turn, or where such center lane is at the time
allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the direction the vehicle is
proceeding and is posted with signs to give notice of such allocation.
      (3)   Official signs may be erected directing specified traffic to use a
designated lane or designating those lanes to be used by traffic moving in a
particular direction regardless of the center of the roadway, or restricting
the use of a particular lane to only buses during certain hours or during all
hours, and drivers of vehicles shall obey the directions of such signs.
      (4)   Official traffic control devices may be installed prohibiting the
changing of lanes on sections of roadway and drivers of vehicles shall obey the
directions of every such device.
   (b)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the

R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described

emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense, if
there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of
less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified in subsections (a)
(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of subsection (a)(1)J. of this section,
that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the
guilt or innocence of the defendant. This subsection does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially
equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains

   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid

and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.

under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.

under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community

      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term

      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.
   (d)   Whoever violates subsection (a) of this section is guilty of operating
a motor vehicle while using an electronic wireless communication device, an
unclassified misdemeanor, and shall be punished as provided in subsections (d)
(1) to (5) of this section.
      (1)   The offender shall be fined, and is subject to a suspension of the
offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction
permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege, as follows:
         A.   Except as provided in subsections (d)(1)B., (d)(1)C., (d)(1)D.
and (d)(2) of this section, the court shall impose upon the offender a fine of
not more than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
         B.   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one prior violation of this section, Ohio
R.C. 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court
shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00).
         C.   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more prior violations of this section,
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent or municipal ordinance, the
court shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00). The court also may impose a suspension of the offender’s
driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege for ninety days.
         D.   Notwithstanding subsections (d)(1)A. to (d)(1)C. of this section,
if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with Ohio R.C.
4511.98, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall
impose upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the
violation under subsections (d)(1)A., (d)(1)B., or (d)(1)C. of this section, as
applicable.
      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom subsection
(d)(1)A of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00) under subsection (d)(1)A. of this section and the
assessment of points under subsection (d)(4) of this section, the offender
instead may elect to attend the distracted driving safety course, as described

303.991. If the offender attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall not be required to pay the fine and
shall not have the points assessed against that offender’s driver’s license if
the offender submits the written evidence to the court. This subsection does

shall be assessed for a violation of subsection (a) of this section in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and Ohio R.C. 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense
as a strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based
on the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for the purposes of enforcing this

wireless communications device.

   335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person

commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
 
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

or parking knowing the operator does not have a valid driver’s license issued
to the operator by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles or a Deputy Registrar under
Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a valid commercial driver’s license issued under Ohio

instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

identification card is now issued in this state. The Registrar or a deputy
registrar shall destroy any such license, temporary instruction permit, or
identification card that is not returned to the issuing authority.

instruction permit, or identification card at any time.
         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

a strict liability offense and strict liability is a culpable mental state for

offense.

on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated

section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster

diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other

State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is

conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.

   501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
   501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, "drug abuse offense" has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
   501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
   501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
 
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
 
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
 
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
 
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
 
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
 
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
 
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
 
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
 
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
 
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
 
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5,000.00
Second degree                                 4,000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2,000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1,000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).
         (ORC 2929.31)
   (d)   In addition to any other sanction imposed upon an offender for a
violation of Chapter
549 - Weapons and Explosives, the court shall order the forfeiture of any
property or instrumentality that is used or intended to be used in the

determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in an amount and in the manner
as provided by law.
   (b)    The Director of Law is hereby authorized to institute an appropriate
civil action in the name of the Municipality in a court of competent
jurisdiction to recover from the convict the reimbursement for the expenses of
his confinement in a municipal jail, workhouse, prison or county jail as may be
determined by the court in the manner provided by law.
   (c)    All amounts recovered for reimbursement of expenses or confinement
pursuant to this section shall be paid into the general fund of the
Municipality.

immediate family.
      (3)   Disclosure of the information would amount to revealing a news
source, privileged under Ohio R.C. 2739.04 or 2739.12.

subsection, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal

vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

   541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.

545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being

violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If

545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for

occupancy of Utility Poles, as well as to construct, whenever possible, excess
available space on Utility Poles and Wireless Support Structures for occupancy
of future Small Cell Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way. The Service

the Public Right-of-Way;

   (a)    Mayfield Village recognizes and supports the vitality and activity
that is created by outdoor business activities at special events within the
Village and in other locations and to permit seasonal mobile food services to
Village businesses. However, the operation of such business or other uses on
public property or within public street rights-of- way requires careful
consideration and review to ensure that such uses function in a manner as to
create the aforementioned benefits without any undue negative effects.
   (b)    The purpose of establishing these regulations is to create a pleasant
and vibrant environment for visitors and residents, to provide an opportunity
for limited operations in park and business areas, to prevent the obstruction
of pedestrian, bicycle and motor vehicle traffic, to ensure that adequate
efforts are made to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public by
requiring permits for mobile food units and to establish minimum requirements
for the permitting operation of such units as defined by the Ohio Fire Code.

Municipality the sum as set forth in Chapter

excavation as security for performance of the terms of the permit, which amount
shall be refunded when the job has been completed, the pavement repaired, and

may apply the amount of the deposit toward payment for having the work done and
shall return to the permit holder the unexpended balance, if any. The
Municipality may also deduct from the amount of the deposit the amount charged
to the permit holder for the erection of barricades and the setting out of
lights as provided in subsection (b) hereof. If the cost of repairing the
pavement and making the backfill and the amount charged for barricades and

         J.    Days, times of operation and locations of service centers.
(2)    The cable operator shall provide customers with written notification of
any change in rates, programming or channel positions, at least 30 days before
the effective date of change.
(3)    Each customer service representative (CSR), technician or employee of
the cable operator in each contact with a customer shall state the estimated
cost of the service, repair or installation orally prior to delivery of the
service or before any work is performed, and shall provide the customer with an
oral statement of the total charges before terminating the telephone call or
before leaving the location at which the work was performed.
   (e)    Customer privacy.
(1)    The cable operator shall not monitor cable television signals to
determine the individual viewing patterns or practices of any customer without
prior written consent from that customer, except as otherwise permitted by the
applicable franchise or law.
      (2)    The cable operator shall not sell or otherwise make available
customer lists or other personally identifiable customer information without
prior written customer consent, except as otherwise permitted by the franchise
or applicable law. The cable operator is permitted to disclose such information
if such disclosure is necessary to render, or conduct, a legitimate business
activity related to a cable service or other service provided by the cable
operator to its customers.
   (f)    Billing.
(1)    Bills will be clear, concise and understandable. Bills must be fully
itemized, with itemizations including, but not limited to, basic and premium
service charges and equipment charges. Bills will also clearly delineate all
activity during the billing period, including optional charges, rebates and
credits.
(2)    In case of a billing dispute, the cable operator must respond to a
written complaint from a subscriber within 30 days.
      (3)    Refunds. Refund checks will be issued promptly, but no later than
either:
         A.    The customer's next billing cycle following resolution of the
request or 30 days, whichever is earlier, or
         B.    The return of the equipment supplied by the cable operator if
service is terminated.
(4)    Credits. Credits for service will be issued no later than the customer's
next billing cycle following the determination that a credit is warranted.
   (g)    Complaint procedures.
(1)    Any verbal, telephonic or written complaint relating to the quality or
continuity of service shall be attended to within a normal service interval. In
the event that such complaints are not responded to or service is not restored
to the levels required by the FCC or by the terms of this chapter during said
normal service interval, the subscriber shall be entitled to a rebate of his or
her monthly service charge or an item of comparable value, whichever is
greater, for the missed appointment. This provision shall not apply if such
delay is occasioned because of an Act of God, strike, national emergency or any
other circumstance beyond the control of the cable operator. Similarly, this
provision shall not apply to service requests or complaints pertaining to
television set malfunction or other breakdown not related to the operation of
the cable television system. The Village Complaint Officer, provided for in
subsection (g)(3) hereof, shall be responsible for invoking said penalty upon
receiving written subscriber complaint. The Complaint Officer shall hold a
hearing on such complaint to be conducted in the manner prescribed in and
otherwise governed by subsection (g)(3) hereof.
(2)    The cable operator shall establish procedures for receiving, acting upon
and resolving subscriber complaints. The cable operator shall furnish a notice
of such procedures to each subscriber at the time of initial subscription to
the system. In addition, the cable operator shall maintain a written record,
printout, or "log", listing date and time of customer complaints, identifying
the subscriber, and describing the nature of the complaints and when and what
action was taken by the cable operator in response thereto. Such records shall
be kept for a period of three years at cable operator's local office,
reflecting the operations to date subject to applicable laws regarding
subscriber privacy and shall be made available for inspection during regular
business hours.
(3)    The Mayor or a designee shall serve as the Village Complaint Officer
with primary responsibility for the continuing administration of complaint
procedures hereunder. Any subscriber, user, programmer, or other interested
person who has a complaint regarding the quality of cable television service,
equipment malfunctions, billings or any other matter, which remains unsolved
for 30 days after it has been brought to the cable operator's attention, may
file a complaint, in writing, with the Complaint Officer. Upon the filing of
such a complaint, said Complaint Officer shall notify the cable operator and
make an investigation to determine whether or not there is a probable cause to
credit the allegations. If the Complaint Officer determines after such
investigation that there is probable cause to credit the allegations of the
complaint, the Complaint Officer shall notify the cable operator and
complainant and promptly endeavor to resolve the matter by conciliation and
persuasion. In the event that the Complaint Officer is unable to obtain
conciliation within a reasonable time, the matter shall be promptly set for a
hearing where all parties may give evidence and the merits of the dispute will
be decided. The Complaint Officer shall make the decision public, along with a
statement reciting the basis therefor. Within 30 days thereafter, either the
cable operator or the complainant may appeal to the Council, in writing, the
decision rendered by the Complaint Officer. At the appeal hearing, the
aggrieved party may contest the findings of fact or interpretation of
controlling law, at which time the Council may affirm, reject or modify the
decision of the Complaint Officer. The affirmance, rejection or modification of
said decision by the Council shall be final unless appealed by the grantee to a
court of competent jurisdiction.
      (4)    Where there have been similar complaints made, or when there
exists other evidence which, in the judgment of the Complaint Officer, casts
doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service, the Complaint Officer
shall have the right and authority to compel the cable operator to test,
analyze and report on the performance of the system. Such report shall be
delivered to the Complaint Officer no later than 14 days after said Officer
formally notifies the cable operator and shall include the following
information: the nature of the complaints which precipitated the special tests;
what system component(s) was tested, the equipment used, and procedures
employed in resolving said complaints, if applicable; and any and all
additional information deemed relevant by the Complaint Officer.
(5)    Said tests and analysis shall be supervised by a qualified engineer not
on the permanent staff of the cable operator and selected by the Village. The
aforesaid engineer shall sign all records of special tests and forward to the
Complaint Officer such records with a report interpreting the results of the
test and recommending action to be taken by the Village.
(6)    The cable operator shall notify each subscriber at the time of initial
installation of the name and address of the Village Complaint Officer and of
the procedures contained in this section.
         (Ord. 2000-39. Passed 9-18-00.)
   946.04 CUSTOMER DISSATISFACTION WITH ANY SERVICE.
   Any customer who requests disconnection of cable service or any particular
programming service previously ordered shall have disconnection effective on
the day such request is made. The customer will not be charged thereafter for
any service disconnected and, in the case of a service for which the customer
has prepaid, the customer shall promptly be provided a credit for or sent a
refund of the unused portion of the prepaid amount.
(Ord. 2000-39. Passed 9-18-00.)
   946.05 SAFETY.
   The cable operator shall install and locate its facilities, cable system and
equipment in compliance with all federal, state, local and company safety
standards, and in such manner as shall not unduly interfere with or endanger
persons or property. Whenever the cable operator receives notice that an unsafe
condition exists with respect to its equipment, the cable operator shall
investigate such condition immediately and shall take such measures as are
necessary to remove or eliminate any unsafe condition.
(Ord. 2000-39. Passed 9-18-00.)
   946.99 PENALTY.
   Should it be found that after conducting the hearing and appeal procedure
provided in this chapter, that the cable operator is in violation of the terms
of the service standards, the penalties chargeable shall be as outlined and
limited in Section 945.27.

and orders of administrative officials or agencies governing zoning and

   (b)    No variance or exception to the codes of the Municipality shall be
considered by the Board until reasonable advance notice of the request has been
sent to all property owners within 300 feet and all adjoining and facing
property owners. However, failure of service on any individual property will
not nullify any variance granted by the Board.

power or authority to grant any change of or variance in any land use or
classification of the district from the existing zoning ordinances or the
Zoning Map of the Municipality, or to permit any Residential land use to become

interested party may appeal the decision of the Board to Council within ten
days of receiving notice of such decision, or approval of the minutes at which
such action was determined, whichever is the earlier. Council may review the
transcript and minutes of the Board hearing, or have a rehearing in front of
Council, and may affirm the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals, or, with a
two-thirds majority vote, modify or reverse the decision. However, any granting
of a "Use" variance in any non-residential district will automatically go to
Village Council for review and approval per Article III, Sections
10,
11 and
12 of the Charter, which includes a mandatory referral to the Planning
Commission for report and recommendation.
 
   (e)    The Board may not grant a variance or exception to the zoning
regulations or building codes, unless the applicant has shown that the literal
application of the provisions of the zoning code or building code would result
in practical difficulties as a result of some peculiar or unique condition or
circumstance pertaining to the zoning lot in question.
   (f)    Any variance granted under this Chapter shall expire within six (6)
months from the date of issuance thereof in the event the work necessitating
the issuance of the variance has not commenced. The Village Building
Commissioner, in her/his sole discretion, may grant one extension of up to six
(6) months upon written application by the applicant of reasonable cause as to
why construction has not been commenced. Any additional extension shall be
subject to formal approval by Village Council who may extend the time for which
to commence construction for a period not to exceed six (6) months.

(Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
 
   1115.03 MINOR SUBDIVISION: CLASSIFICATION; APPLICATION; APPROVAL.
    (a)    Classification. A subdivision as defined in Section
1113.22 is classified as a minor subdivision if it comprises a division of a
parcel of land along an existing public street not involving the opening,
widening or extension of any street or road, not involving the installation of
any underground public utilities and not involving more than five lots after
the original tract and all the contiguous land owned by the developer has been
completely subdivided. The replatting of not more than five lots along a public
street is also classified as a minor subdivision.
   (b)    Application. An application for approval for each minor subdivision
including a sketch plan complying with the requirements set forth in Section
1121.02 shall be filed by the developer with the secretary of the Planning and
Zoning Commission. The Commission shall take action upon the application at the
next regularly scheduled meeting after receipt of all required information.
   (c)   Approval. If the Commission finds after reviewing the proposed
division of land that:
      (1)    Not more than five lots will be created and all the land in the
original tract and all the contiguous land owned by the developer would be
completely subdivided; and
      (2)    The sketch plan is properly coordinated with adjoining
developments and adjoining unplatted land; and
      (3)    The sketch plan complies with the planning criteria and other
provisions of these regulations and other codes and plans of the City applying
to minor subdivision, then the Commission shall approve the proposed minor
subdivision.
   A notation of the action taken shall be made on the sketch plan and deed by
the secretary, chairman or other official as may be designated by the
Commission, and the developer shall be informed if a metes and bounds deed
description or a plat will be required. Three prints of the approved sketch
plan shall be furnished to the Commission.
   If the Commission determines the proposal should be reviewed as a major
subdivision or if the proposal cannot be approved for other reasons, the
Commission may suggest revisions to the plan before it is resubmitted.
(Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1115.04 MINOR SUBDIVISION: RECORDING.
   After approval of the sketch plan of a minor subdivision, the developer
shall submit a conveyance with either a metes and bounds description or plat,
as required by the Planning and Zoning Commission, to the Municipal Engineer
for review. If he finds it complies with the approved sketch plan and is
otherwise satisfactory, he shall certify the approval thereon within seven
working days after he has received it. The approval shall expire within 120
days unless the deed description or plat has been filed and recorded in the
office of the County Recorder and the Commission so notified by the developer
in writing.
(Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1115.05 MAJOR SUBDIVISION: PRELIMINARY PLAN.
   (a)    Classification. A subdivision as defined in Section
1113.22 is classified as a major subdivision if more than five lots are created
or if any subdivision or resubdivision involves the opening, widening or
extension of any street, the allocation of land for open space for common use,
or the granting of easements for the extension and maintenance of water supply,
sewage disposal or other public facilities in connection with the improvement
of one or more parcels of land for residential, business or industrial
developments.
   (b)    Application. An application for approval along with five black-on-
white prints of the preliminary plan, or alternate plans, complying with the
planning criteria set forth in Chapter
1117  shall be submitted to the secretary of the Planning and Zoning Commission
for each proposed major subdivision. The purposes of the preliminary plan are
to explore the best subdivision design and its relationship to adjoining
developments or vacant land, to outline a program of land improvements and
obtain the suggestions and recommendations of the Commission before a firm plan
is prepared.
   For subdivisions where public utilities are not accessible at the site or
where rezoning is involved, the developer may submit as a preapplication step,
a sketch plan and an outline program for land improvements without all of the
required maps, data and plans before proceeding with the preliminary plan as
otherwise required.
   (c)    Planning and Zoning Commission Action. Whenever the Commission has
received an application and all of the maps, drawings, data and plans as
required by Section
1121.03, the secretary shall place such application on the agenda of its next
regular meeting for preliminary discussion, provided it is received in
sufficient time to be accommodated on the agenda, and shall set a date for a
public hearing.
   The secretary shall refer one copy to the Commission's planning consultants
if there are any, and two copies to the Municipal Engineer for review and
report as to compliance with all relevant regulations, standards and criteria,
as to coordination of the design with the natural features of the site and
surrounding developments and as to conformance with the components of the
Master Plan. They shall also make recommendations for improvements to the
design. Within three weeks from receiving such a preliminary plan, the planning
consultant and Municipal Engineer shall provide and furnish their reports to
the Commission.
   The Commission shall act at the next regular meeting after the meeting at
which the preliminary discussion was held, or within a mutually agreed upon
extension, otherwise the plan shall be deemed to have been approved. If the
Commission, after an evaluation of the preliminary plan and reports of the
planning consultant and Municipal Engineer, approves the preliminary plan, the
chairman and secretary shall affix their signatures to five copies of the plan
with a notation of any special conditions, as the Commission may attach, and
shall recommend the plan to Council for its approval. Council shall approve or
disapprove the recommendation within sixty days, but a vote of not less than
five members of Council shall be required in order to disapprove a decision of
the Commission which approved the plan. Upon approval, the Clerk of Council
shall return one copy to the developer, one copy to the Commission, submit one
copy to the Mayor and one copy to the Board of Education and retain one copy.
   If the Commission or Council fails to approve the preliminary plan, it shall
state in its records the reason or reasons for such disapproval.
   (d)    Authorization to Proceed. The approval of the preliminary plan by
Council authorizes the developer to proceed with the preparation of the final
plat and assures him that for a one-year period from the date of such
authorization, that:
      (1)    The general layout of streets, lots and other features of the
preliminary plan may serve as the basis for the preparation of the final plat;
and
      (2)    Any special conditions under which the approval of the plan was
granted shall not be changed; and
      (3)    The developer may submit a final plat and drawings and
specifications for improvements for the whole or part of the subdivision.
         (Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1115.06 MAJOR SUBDIVISION: FINAL PLAT.
   (a)    Application. An application for approval of a final plat shall be
filed with the secretary of the Planning and Zoning Commission within one year
after authorization to proceed unless the Commission extends the time. The
application shall include the original tracing of the final plat, the original
tracing of the drawings for the required improvements, three black-on-white
prints of each tracing, three sets of specifications and other maps, data and
certificates as required and set forth in Section
1121.04.
   The developer may obtain conditional approval of the plat and install the
required improvements before applying for approval of the final plat, or
alternatively, he may apply for approval of the final plat and drawings and
specifications of required improvements concurrently and furnish a performance
guarantee bond, a surety bond or security in such form as may be approved by
Council, in the amount of 100 percent of the estimate of all the improvements
guaranteeing that he will install all the improvements thereafter within two
years of the approval of the final plat unless an extension of time is granted
by Council. If approved, the developer may construct sections of the
improvements before approval of the final plat and furnish a performance
guarantee bond, a surety bond or security for the construction of the remaining
improvements.
   If, however, after two years, or after the period of extension granted by
Council, the improvements have not been installed, Council may authorize the
work to be completed and may then proceed against the developer and its surety
for reimbursement.
   The developer may apply for final plat approval for only that section of an
approved preliminary plan of a subdivision which he proposes to develop and
record as the first stage. However, the approval of any section of the
preliminary plan shall become null and void if an application for final plat
approval is not submitted within one year after approval of the preliminary
plan, unless an extension of time is granted by the Commission.
   (b)    Review by Municipal Engineer. The secretary of the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall transmit two prints of each drawing and the
specifications to the Municipal Engineer for determination if:
      (1)    The final plat conforms to the approved preliminary plans and any
special conditions or modification stipulated, and for correctness of
mathematical data and computations; and
      (2)    The designs and details of the required improvements as shown on
the drawings and specifications are in conformance with the plans for utilities
and streets and constructed in conformance with the approved standards of the
Municipality. One copy of the drawings and specifications shall be returned to
the Commission within ten days, indicating the Engineer's findings and
recommendations.
   (c)    Planning Commission Action. If the Engineer determines that the final
plat, drawings and specifications are satisfactory in regard to the aforesaid
provisions and if the subdivision complies with all other applicable provisions
of these regulations, the Commission shall approve it. Action shall be taken
within one month after the meeting at which the application for approval and
all required plats, maps and data were submitted to the Commission, or within
an extension of time set by the Commission.
   The Commission shall act upon the final plat, drawings and specifications,
either separately or concurrently, but in no event shall it approve the final
plat for recording until the improvements are constructed by the developer or
their construction guaranteed by an approved surety bond. The amount of the
bond shall be the estimated costs of the improvements, as estimated by the
Engineer. The form of the bond shall be approved by the Law Director.
   (d)    Approval; Disapproval. The approval of the final plat shall be
indicated by a certification to that effect on the original tracing of the plat
with the signatures of the chairman and secretary of the Commission. The
Commission shall obtain one duplicate tracing thereof at the developer's
expense before returning the tracing to him. The reason for disapproval of a
plat shall be stated in the records of the Commission.
   The approval of the drawings and specifications for the required
improvements shall be indicated by a certification to that effect on the
original drawings and specifications with the signature of the Municipal
Engineer. Approval of the improvements as constructed shall likewise be
certified by the Engineer.
   (e)    Recording. The developer shall file the approved final plat in the
office of the County Recorder. The approval of the Commission shall expire
within sixty days unless within that period, the plat has been duly filed and
recorded and the Commission so notified by the developer in writing. If the
final plat is revised in any manner after approval, a new approval shall be
necessary.
   (f)    Approval and Recording. If drawings and specifications for
improvements are approved and construction guaranteed, the final plat may be
approved and recorded, construction of improvements started, building permits
issued, and lots may be sold, leased or transferred.
   Occupancy permits for a building shall not be issued until streets and
utilities are installed for public use.
(Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1115.07 LAND FOR PUBLIC AND COMMON USE.
   (a)    Dedication and Acceptance for Public Use. The plat shall be submitted
to Council for acceptance of dedication of any land for public use and
acceptance of any easement before it is recorded. The acceptance of any street
or utility for public use and maintenance, and assignment of street names,
shall be by separate action of Council. Six months after the completion of the
permanent paving, but not sooner than June 1 of the year following the
completion of the pavement, an inspection of all improvements installed by the
developer shall be made by a committee of Council and the Municipal Engineer.
Any defects disclosed by this inspection shall be corrected by the developer.
When the improvements installed by the developer are approved by Council, the
developer shall file with the Law Director an abstract, certificate of title,
guarantee of title or title insurance in the amount of at least one thousand
dollars ($1,000) showing the title to the street or streets in the subdivision
of the Municipality to be good for street purposes and to be free and clear
from all encumbrances whatsoever. Council shall then approve the plat for the
dedication of such street areas, shall accept the streets as Municipal streets
and release all of the bonds.
   (b)    Land Reserved for Public Use. In addition to land for local streets
which principally serve the subdivision under consideration, the Municipality
may request by resolution that land for other streets, for parks, playgrounds
or other public uses as shown on the official Master Plan, the Street Plan or
Community Facilities Plan or determined by adopted standards, be set aside and
reserved for a period of 120 days after the application for approval of a
preliminary plan of a subdivision is submitted, or for a longer period as may
be mutually agreed, to allow the Municipality time to start proceedings to
acquire such land by gift, purchase, exchange, devise or appropriation.
   During such period, no structure shall be erected, no trees or topsoil shall
be removed or destroyed, no grading shall be done, nor shall any land so
reserved be put to any use whatsoever except on written approval of the
Planning and Zoning Commission.
   If land for a recreational use is shown within a proposed subdivision on an
official plan, the developer may be required to contribute land, or if no land
for recreational use is shown within a proposed subdivision on an official
plan, the developer may be required to contribute a fee to a land acquisition
fund for playground use. Any required contributions of land or a fee shall be
in accordance with established standards based on costs prorated among the
properties served by the recreation facility.

industrial subdivisions involving the division or allocation of land for open
spaces, for common use, for the opening or extensions of streets or as
easements for the extension and maintenance of sewers, water supply or other
public facilities.
   (b)    The preliminary plans of such subdivisions shall be planned in

   1117.01 INTENT.
   Planning criteria are herein established as fundamental principles and each
are to be applied with professional skill in the planning, subdividing and
resubdividing the land so as to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
   (a)    To provide for the planning of attractive and harmonious
neighborhoods, to take advantage of the topography and natural features; and
   (b)    To relate the planning of neighborhoods to a pedestrian and vehicular
circulation system, to implement the Street Plan, to provide convenient and
safe local streets; and
   (c)    To provide quiet neighborhoods - to plan a common green area network
where desired - under all types of neighborhood planning; however, each lot
shall form a functional building site; and
   (d)    To provide for the implementation of the community facilities plan by
reserving and acquiring sites for public uses; and
   (e)    To provide for planned unit industrial subdivisions by the
application of the same basic planning criteria; and
   (f)    To provide for the coordination of planning and division of land in
connection with planned development areas, where buildings are included, and to
carry out the objectives of the Master Plan.
      (Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1117.02 LAND PLANNING.
   Land developments shall be planned to take advantage of the topography of
the land in order to utilize the natural contours, to economize in the
construction of drainage facilities, to reduce the amount of grading and to
minimize destruction of trees and topsoil. The natural features and other
distinctive characteristics of the site shall be integrated into the plan to
create functional variations in the neighborhoods. Detailed topographic maps
shall be utilized in the land planning.
   (a)    Streets and Topography. Land which is relatively flat, or of very
gentle undulations, shall be planned so that the streets follow the natural
drainage courses and, insofar as possible, all building sites shall be above
the street grade. On more irregular topography, streets should follow the
ridges or be planned approximately parallel to contour lines and designed to
avoid extensive cuts and fills.
   (b)    Natural Drainage. All developments, particularly of land of very
gentle slopes, shall be designed to take advantage of natural contours so that
all the land can be drained with a minimum of reshaping. Unless water courses
or drainage ways are enclosed, the plan shall be adjusted so that rear lot
lines, or areas held as public or private common land, shall be approximately
parallel to the natural or straightened water course, and only where such a
plan is not practical, may side lot lines be arranged parallel to an open
drainage course. Easements for drainage ways and low-lying areas which are
subject to flooding may be included as part of a lot but shall not be utilized
as a building site or included in calculation of required lot area or width.
   (c)    Natural Features. Natural features, irregularities, changes in level,
brooks, hills and other focal points within the site, and distant views outside
the subdivision shall be coordinated with the design to obtain natural variety
and interest in each neighborhood and the most attractive building sites and
views possible. Trees, topsoil and other natural resources shall be preserved
and utilized in the development of the subdivision. Certain required dimensions
may be adjusted to preserve such features when approved in accordance with the
provisions of the Subdivision Regulations and Zoning Code.
      (Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1117.03 STREETS.
   Streets shall be designed to implement the Street Plan, to be in accord with
the functions served as classified in Section
1113.21 and to be related to the use of abutting land. Furthermore, streets
shall be designed to comply with planning criteria as follows:
   (a)    Arterial Street System. The arterial street system shall be planned
in compliance with the duly adopted Street Plan, and unless shown otherwise on
the Plan, arterial streets shall be planned for continuation of existing
streets in the system and at the same width, or at greater width in accordance
with adopted standards. Access to arterial streets shall be controlled in the
interest of public safety and to maintain the design capacity of the street
system. Arterial streets should be planned to have a minimum distance of 600 to
800 feet between intersections. Access driveways to developments between
intersecting streets should be regulated insofar as possible to one driveway at
intervals of 200 feet by combining the access to several developments or by
other means.
   (b)    Collector Street System. Collector streets connect the local
residential street system and the main highway and should be oriented to one or
more focal points of traffic generation. They should be planned for continuity
and will normally contain a relatively large number of intersections with local
streets.
   (c)    Relation to Residential Developments. Wherever a one-family
residential development abuts an arterial street, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may, in order to protect residential property from the movements of
heavy traffic and to control intersections with arterial streets, require:
      (1)    Marginal streets parallel to the arterial street; or
      (2)    Reverse frontage lots between an arterial street and a parallel
local street with screen planting located in a nonaccess reservation along the
right-of- way line of the arterial street; or
      (3)    The fronting of lots with extra width on perpendicular local
streets; or
      (4)    Lots with extra depth fronting on the arterial street with access
provided by combined driveways.
   (d)    Right-of-Way Widths. The right of way for arterial streets shall be
determined by the Commission but in no case shall the right of way be less than
eighty feet. The right of way for collector streets shall be not less than
seventy feet.
      (Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1117.04 STREET PATTERN: RESIDENTIAL AREAS.
   The primary function of local streets is to provide direct access to each
lot and development. The local street system should be designed to minimize
through traffic movements. This can be accomplished by adequate peripheral
collector street capacity, and by creating discontinuities in the local street
pattern, by offsetting local street intersections and providing loop streets or
cul-de-sac streets. Every part of a residential area should be interconnected
for convenience and to avoid excessive indirect travel except where connections
are not feasible because of topographic conditions.
   The pattern should be logical and comprehensive for the convenience of the
local residents, visitors and for providing services. The design should be
planned to provide these basic functions so as not to need to rely on extensive
traffic regulations. The streets should be designed for uniformly low volumes
of traffic, commensurate with residential amenities, and to discourage speeds
of more than twenty-five miles per hour. The amount of space devoted to local
streets should be minimized for costs and economy of land use.
   There should be a basic underlying design related to the topography and
natural features. The pattern should also be related to attaining functional,
economical and practical patterns, shapes and sizes of areas for development.
Necessary traffic generators such as schools, bus routes and playgrounds should
serve as focal points in the pattern and such routes should have a minimum
number of pedestrian crossings. There should be a minimum number of
intersections; tee-intersections should predominate, cross-intersections should
be minimized.
(Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   (a)    Right-of-Way and Pavement Widths. Whenever local streets are planned
in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section, the right-of-way
width of such street shall be sixty feet and the pavement width between curbs
shall be twenty-six feet. However, in constructing a street in accordance with
Section
1119.09(a)(3), the right-of-way width shall be sixty feet and the pavement
width shall be twenty feet from berm to berm.
      (Ord. 85-5. Passed 4-15-85.)
   (b)    Intersections. Streets shall be designed to intersect as nearly at
ninety degrees as possible; no street shall intersect another at less than
seventy degrees. The intersection of more than two streets at a point or with
center line offsets of less than 200 feet shall not be permitted.
         The vertical alignment, or grade within 100 feet of an intersection
should not exceed three percent. An unobstructed "sight triangle" of not less
than seventy- five feet measured along the center lines of the intersecting
streets shall be provided. Property lines at street intersections shall be
rounded with a radius of not less than thirty feet for arterial streets; twenty
feet for collector streets; twelve feet for local streets.
   (c)    Vertical Alignment. The maximum grade for local streets should not
exceed four percent in "ordinary (0% to 8%) terrain"; grades exceeding seven
percent should be permitted for only short distances of approximately 200 feet.
A rate of change of three to four percent per 100 feet is the maximum
recommended to provide a safe sight distance.
   (d)    Horizontal Alignment. Properly designed curving residential streets
are encouraged. Angles of horizontal alignment of the center lines of streets
shall be connected by a curve with a radius of not less than 150 feet; between
reverse curves there shall be a center line tangent of not less than 100 feet.
   (e)    Streets: Cul-de-sac; Permanent Dead-end. Cul-de-sac streets or
permanent dead-end streets shall be permitted where parcels are surrounded by
allotments, where irregular topography would require excessive grading for
continuous streets or where other types of nonthrough streets would not provide
sufficient discouragement of through traffic. All cul-de-sac streets shall be
terminated with a permanent turn-around or square having a minimum curb radius
of fifty feet and a street property line radius of sixty-five feet. Cul-de-sac
streets shall not exceed 500 feet in length unless an additional turn-around or
square is provided. If the cul-de-sac street does not open in the direction of
schools or playgrounds, a pedestrian-way may be required. In addition, the
Commission may require that the center of the turn-around be planted with
permanent evergreens and ground cover, and that the turn-around be designed to
provide additional parking spaces.
   (f)    Temporary Dead-end Streets. Where a proposed subdivision adjoins
undeveloped land, a temporary "T" turn-around may be provided for each street
if not more than 500 feet in length. Provisions shall be made for the future
extension of such streets and utilities, and for the reversion of the excess
right of way to the abutting properties.
   (g)    Streets of Nonconforming Width. Streets of less than the required
width shall not be permitted except where the Planning and Zoning Commission
finds such a street will be adequate to serve the proposed development.
Wherever property abuts a street which does not conform to the width required
by the Street Plan, the Subdivision Regulations or plans of the County or State
Department of Transportation, the additional width shall be provided when the
land is subdivided.
   (h)    Reserve Strips Adjoining Streets. A division of land to prevent
access or extensions to pavement and/or utilities to another property shall not
be permitted except where the control and provisions for disposal of such land
division has been assigned to the City.
   (i)    Driveways. Driveways shall be located at least sixty feet from the
intersection of the projection of the right-of-way lines of the nearest
intersecting streets.
   (j)    Street Names. Names shall be selected which will not duplicate or be
confused with the names of existing streets in Cuyahoga County irrespective of
modifying terms such as street, avenue, boulevard, etc. Streets that are or
will eventually be continuations of existing or platted streets shall be named
the same. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the Commission.
      (Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1117.05 STREETS FOR APARTMENT DEVELOPMENTS.
   Streets serving apartment buildings shall be planned to connect with
arterial or collector streets so as to not generate traffic on local
residential streets. Vehicular and pedestrian access shall be adequate and
convenient to each dwelling unit, planned so that a street, service drive,
parking area or delivery area will be located not more than 100 feet from every
main or service entrance of every apartment building.
   The criteria for horizontal and vertical alignment, intersections and other
design criteria of streets in apartment developments shall be the same as the
design criteria for one-family subdivisions. The distinguishing feature is the
heavier traffic volumes caused by the greater population density. A cul-de-sac
street shall not exceed 300 feet in length. The minimum rights of way shall be
not less than sixty feet; the minimum paved surface between curbs shall be
thirty-two feet.
(Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1117.06 STREETS FOR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS.
   Streets serving business developments and accessory parking areas shall be
planned to connect with arterial streets so as to not generate traffic on local
residential streets. The intersection of service streets or driveways from
parking areas with arterial or collector streets shall be located so as to
cause the least possible interference with the movement of traffic on the
arterial streets, and wherever possible, shall be located not less than 100
feet from the intersection of an arterial or collector street, measured from
the intersection of the projection of the right-of-way lines or spaced not less
than 200 feet from each other.
   Parking areas serving adjoining business establishments shall be
interconnected by on-site drives and designed to provide the maximum safety and
convenience, and to accomplish such purposes, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may require marginal service roads along arterial streets.
(Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1117.07 STREETS FOR INDUSTRIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   Collector streets for industrial subdivisions shall be planned to serve
industrial areas exclusively and shall connect with arterial streets so that no
industrial traffic will be directed onto any residential streets. The
intersections of service streets and access driveways to parking areas with
arterial streets should be located at intervals of not less than 200 feet in
the interest of public safety and to maintain the design capacity of the
street.
   The street layout of the industrial subdivision shall be planned to provide
the lot areas and widths as required in the Zoning Code; it may be planned for
progressive extension as the subdivision is developed. The street plan shall be
in general conformity with plans for the development of the adjoining
industrial areas and the adopted Street Plan. Streets shall be planned to be
extended to the boundaries of any adjoining land planned for industry, except
for topographic or other physical conditions, or if the Planning and Zoning
Commission finds such extension is not in accord with the approved plan of the
area. In such locations, the Commission may permit a cul-de-sac street as a
temporary measure as part of a progressive development program.
   The minimum pavement width shall be thirty-two feet; the minimum radius of
curbs at intersections shall be thirty-five feet; the minimum right of way
shall be not less than seventy feet. Each street shall be of sufficient width
to safely accommodate the projected traffic volumes and access for fire
protection equipment. The pavement turn-around shall have a minimum outside
curb radius of fifty-five feet and a property line radius of at least sixty-
five feet. The criteria for horizontal and vertical alignment, intersections
and other design criteria shall be the same as set forth in this chapter for
collector streets.
(Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1117.08 DESIGN OF BLOCKS.
   The boundaries and lines of blocks and other parts of neighborhoods shall be
designed and adjusted to conform to the topography and natural features to the
corporation lines, to the street planning criteria as set forth in Section
1117.04, to accommodate lots and building sites of the size and character
required for the district as set forth in the Zoning Code and to provide for
the required community facilities.
   (a)    Size of Blocks. For one-family subdivisions the length of blocks
shall be planned to not exceed 2500 feet or be less than 800 feet unless
approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The width of blocks shall be
planned to accommodate two tiers of lots. A single tier of lots may, however,
be required by the Commission to separate residential development from major
streets as set forth in Section
1117.03, from adjoining nonresidential land uses, from areas of unusual
topographic or natural features, and tiers of lots may be separated by common
green areas.
   (b)    Small Subdivisions. Whenever a parcel is too small to be planned for
the use intended and would result in fractional or odd-shaped lots or lack of
street frontage, or otherwise does not conform to the planning criteria of the
Subdivision Regulations and the Zoning Code, the Planning and Zoning Commission
may request the developer to include adjoining unsubdivided land so that the
project may be coordinated with the neighborhood and eventually developed as a
unit.
   (c)    Pedestrian Circulation. Pedestrian ways of not less than twenty feet
in width may be required for walkways across excessively long blocks or at the
end of cul-de-sac streets for access to schools, playgrounds or bus stops, or
to other public facilities where convenient pedestrian circulation has not been
provided by the street pattern. (Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1117.09 DESIGN OF LOTS.
   Each lot shall be designed to form a functional site for the type of
dwelling and the ancillary open space and the lot lines shall not be considered
as merely a geometric shape enclosing the minimum requirements. The lots shall
generally be rectangular in form; triangular, elongated or other shapes that
restrict its use as a building site and utilization of yards shall be avoided.
   (a)    Area and Width of Lot. In residential subdivisions the area and width
of lots shall be in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Zoning
Code, which requirements shall be construed as absolute minimum and not as
optimum dimensions. The width of lot shall be not less than required at the
front yard building line, on curved streets; the arc of the front lot line or a
rear lot line shall be not less than sixty percent of the required width at the
building line.
   (b)    Depth of Lots. The depth of a lot abutting a local street in a
proposed one-family subdivision should not exceed three and one-half times its
width. This ratio shall be increased when the rear line of such lots abuts a
railroad, a freeway, other nonresidential land uses or where the rear yard
contains rugged topography. Lots abutting major streets may exceed the
aforesaid depth ratio as set forth in Section
1117.03 in order to increase the safety and privacy thereon. The Municipality
may prepare a local street plan of partially subdivided areas and reserve
openings at intervals along the major roads for future local streets to serve
the interior areas in accordance with duly adopted mapped street procedures .
   (c)    Corner Lots. In one-family subdivisions, corner lots shall have extra
width to obtain the required side yards and building setback from both streets
and to obtain appropriate orientation to both streets and as set forth in the
Zoning Code.
   (d)    Side Lot Lines. In one-family subdivisions, side lot lines shall be
designed to be at approximately right angles to street lines or radial to
curved street lines. Where a street intersects another to form a "T"
intersection, the side lot lines shall be planned so that one line will be
located approximately on the projected center line of the street which
terminates.
      (Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1117.10 PUBLIC LAND USES.
   The subdivision regulations shall aid in the implementation of the Community
Facilities Plan as follows:
   (a)    Sites for Community Facilities. Sites for parks, playgrounds, schools
and other public uses as shown on the duly adopted Community Facilities Plan,
if located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision, shall be incorporated
in the subdivision plan and the land reserved for such purposes. Drainage
courses, ponds, lakes or isolated parcels shall not be accepted for public use
and maintenance unless conforming with the plan for public lands.
   (b)    Utility Easements. Where utilities are not located in the street,
easements of at least twelve feet total width shall be located on the center of
rear lot lines or on side lot lines where necessary.
   (c)    Drainage Ways. Where a subdivision is traversed by a drainage way,
channel or stream, a storm water easement or drainage right of way conforming
substantially with the lines of such watercourse shall be established. Such
easements shall be not less than twenty feet wide, exclusive of the required
lot area, or of such further width as deemed adequate for the purpose. Rear lot
lines should be planned along such drainage ways.
      (Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)

   1119.01 INTENT.
   Provisions for requiring improvements are hereby established to be applied
to each proposed subdivision and resubdivision for designing, constructing and
assuring the construction of land improvements so as to achieve, among others,
the following purposes:
   (a)    That the natural site assets such as existing trees and topsoil are
preserved and the site graded to the extent necessary to provide a system of
drainage; and
   (b)    That all on-site and off-site extensions of pavements and utilities
are constructed to complete the street and utility system; and
   (c)    That the Village is assured all required improvements are constructed
for the entire project, or for a progressive series of parts thereof; and
   (d)    To provide measures for enforcement thereof by withholding recording
and transfer of land until the construction is satisfactorily completed.
       (Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1119.02 DEVELOPER RESPONSIBLE FOR REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   The developer shall provide and install at his expense the improvements
required herein, or he shall provide financial guarantees in lieu of actual
installation as precedents to the recording and sale of lots and the issuance
of building permits.
   (a)    Improvements Within the Subdivision. Land for rights of way for all
local and collector streets within the subdivision, and land for the widening
or extension of arterial streets on the boundary of any proposed subdivision
shall be dedicated by the developer, and all easements shall be provided.
Utilities and pavements shall be furnished and installed as hereinafter
required and they shall be of such sizes and capacities as are required for the
development of the proposed subdivision, and as may be necessary to serve
adjacent undeveloped land which is an integral part of the service area. The
developer shall be required to extend improvements to the boundary of the
proposed subdivision to serve adjoining unsubdivided land. However, where the
Planning and Zoning Commission determines that a connecting street is necessary
for the future subdividing of adjoining land, but the present construction of
pavement and/or utilities therein are not warranted, the Commission may require
the dedication of land for such connecting street and the pavement for the
intersections constructed and connections to the utilities made available for
future extension.
   (b)    Off-Site Extensions. The construction of off-site improvements to
serve a proposed subdivision may be required of the developer as a precedent to
approval if adequate utilities or streets are not available at the boundary of
the proposed subdivision, provided the Commission finds the extension of the
improvements across undeveloped or unserved areas would not be warranted as a
special assessment to the intervening properties or a Municipal expense until
some future date.
      (Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1119.03 GRADING.
   The developer shall prepare a grading plan for each subdivision in order to
establish street grades, floor elevation of buildings and a system of drainage
for private lots, all in proper relation to each other and to existing
topography, as follows:
   (a)    Grading of Block. The grading plan for the block shall be in
accordance with criteria as set forth in Section
1117.02. The purposes are:
      (1)    To divert water away from buildings;
      (2)    To prevent standing water and soil saturation detrimental to
buildings and the use of the lot;
      (3)    To provide for disposal of water from the lot except that which
should be retained for irrigation;
      (4)    To preserve desirable site features; and
      (5)    To provide grades for safe and convenient access to and around
buildings and the lot for their use and maintenance.
         The finished grading shall be designed in accordance with the chapter
on Lot Improvements, details 88 through 91, of the FHA Minimum Property
Standards for One and Two Living Units, and Section M 309 Grading Design of the
Municipal Property Standards for Multifamily Housing.
         The grading of the roadway shall be in accordance with criteria set
forth in Section
1117.02, and extend the full width of the right of way except in rolling
topography. Tree lawns should be graded at a gradient of not less than two
percent or more than four percent upward from the curb to the sidewalk or
property line.
   (b)    Lot Grading. The floor elevation of each building shall be
established in proper relation to the surrounding grades, to the driveway and
the street. There should be a minimum grade of two percent around each building
so that water drains to lower areas or drainage swales which shall have a
minimum grade of 0.5 percent. The lot drainage system shall be designed so that
surface water will drain onto the driveway, a drainage structure on the lot, a
street gutter and storm sewer, or a natural drainage way.
         The minimum grades of driveways shall be 0.5 percent; the maximum
shall be twelve percent. Grading should be adjusted so there will be no abrupt
grades in the front yards and along side lot lines. The grades of earth
terraces shall not exceed a two and one-half to one slope. If a masonry
retaining wall exceeds three feet in height, a hedge, fence or railing shall be
provided on it.
   (c)    Topsoil and Trees. The topsoil shall be stripped from the roadway and
construction areas, piled separately and not removed from the site or used as
spoil. The Planning and Zoning Commission may require that as many trees as can
be reasonably utilized in the final development plan be retained, and that
grading be adjusted to the existing grade around the trees.
      (Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1119.04 DRAINAGE FACILITIES.
   A drainage system shall be designed and constructed by the developer as
required for the district in which the proposed subdivision is located for the
proper drainage of the surface water of the subdivision and each lot as
follows:
   (a)    Enclosed Storm Sewer. An enclosed storm sewer system shall be
provided and connected to an existing storm sewer system, drainage ditch or
other waterway, as determined by the Municipal Engineer. The system shall have
a capacity to serve the subdivision and drainage area of which it is a part.
The system shall include pipes, culverts, manholes, catch basins, drain inlets
and a connection for each lot.
   (b)    Open Drainage System. Subject to the approval of the Planning and
Zoning Commission, the developer may rechannel any water course through his
property in order to contain the storm drain flow within a lesser width. The
developer may be required to deed in fee, dedicate or grant an easement to the
Municipality for a drainage channel not less in width than required by a plan
or standards adopted by the Municipality or as directed by the Municipal
Engineer. The developer shall be responsible for clearing the drainage way of
all debris as a condition of acceptance. The Municipal Engineer shall determine
the proper cross section, grade, width of channel and horizontal alignment.
   (c)    Design Standards. The drainage system shall be designed in accordance
with standards of the Municipal Engineer and the Cuyahoga County Sanitary
Engineering Department. The design of storm frequency shall be as indicated in
the following schedule:
 
One and two-family 5 years
All other uses     10 years
   (d)    Acceptance of Storm and Sanitary Sewers. Prior to final approval of
any newly installed sewer system and/or reconstructed sewer, the contractor
constructing such sewer or the developer of the subdivision in which such sewer
was installed shall cause to be made at his expense one set of photographs of
the entire sewer system installed, both sanitary and storm, at the completion
of all mains, showing thereby that the sewer system was constructed upon sound
engineering standards and that the system is free of any and all accumulations
of foreign substance and debris and that the passage and flow of sewage and
storm water will be free and clear. Upon inspection of such photographs, and if
satisfied that such sewer is free and clear of all foreign substances and
debris and is of sound workmanship and complies with sound engineering
standards, the Municipal Engineer is thereupon authorized to approve the same
as a final inspection, placing in safe keeping for future reference all
photographs which shall remain the property of the Municipality.
      (Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1119.05 SANITARY SEWERS.
   Sanitary sewers shall be designed in accordance with the Master Sewer Plan
of the Municipality and constructed by the developer of each proposed
subdivision or development; a house connection shall be provided for each lot.
The sanitary system shall be designed and constructed in accordance with such
regulations and standards as may be established by the Municipal Engineer and
the Cuyahoga County Sanitary Engineering Department. Final approval and
acceptance shall be as indicated in Section
1119.04(d).
(Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1119.06 WATER SERVICE.
   A public water distribution system shall be designed and constructed by the
developer of each subdivision or development and a supply shall be provided for
each lot. The water distribution system shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with the rules and standards as may be established by the Municipal
Engineer and the Division of Water and Heat of the City of Cleveland.
(Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1119.07 ELECTRIC AND TELEPHONE SERVICE.
   The electrical contractor shall install code approved galvanized conduit of
rigid type at a minimum burial depth of twenty-four inches below the finished
grade. The initial backfill shall be a minimum depth of twelve inches of sand.
The conduit shall run from the Illuminating Company grade level connection
chamber to the meter socket and shall conform to specifications of the
Illuminating Company. Galvanized conduits of rigid type shall be used for all
bends and connections.
   The electrical contractor shall also install in like manner conduit to
service telephone lines from the telephone company roadway ground connection to
the telephone entrance elf. The installation shall conform to specifications of
the telephone company.
(Ord. 74-22. Passed 4-15-74.)
   1119.08 GAS FUEL SERVICE.
   The developer shall submit plans for a gas fuel distribution system for the
proposed subdivision or development and a supply line shall be provided for
each lot. The gas system shall be designed and constructed in accordance with
the rules and standards of the East Ohio Gas Company as approved by the City.
(Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1119.09 PAVEMENT, CURBS AND SIDEWALKS.
   The pavement, curbs and sidewalks shall be designed and constructed by the
developer as required for the district in which the subdivision is located and
set forth in the schedules in the Subdivision Regulations and in the Street and
Sidewalk Code of the Municipality.
   (a)    Pavement.
      (1)    For all pavement constructed in accordance with this subsection
and subsection (a)(2) and (3) hereof, the width of the pavement shall be
measured between the vertical faces of straight curbs and the outside edges of
rolled curbs. The materials and the construction shall be in accordance with
the "Detailed Specifications" as required by and now on file with the Municipal
Engineer and "Material Specifications" of the State Department of
Transportation, whichever is applicable. The pavement requirements may be
modified if found necessary by the Engineer and if approved by the Planning and
Zoning Commission, because of extraordinary traffic loads or unusual soil
conditions in specific locations. After the underground utilities and house
connections are installed and backfilled, and rough grading completed, the
roadway subgrade shall be shaped, rolled and compacted. In those residential
subdivisions already under construction and approved for concrete streets and
in those planned residential subdivisions which have streets that are
continuations or extensions of existing residential subdivisions with concrete
streets, the developer shall construct the final pavement of reinforced
concrete with integral curbs, or the developer may request to construct a
temporary pavement of slag or stone for use during the building construction
period and furnish a cash bond of at least ten percent (10%) of the amount of
the performance bond or in other amounts mutually agreed to, guaranteeing that
all pavements shall be maintained in a passable and reasonable condition and
rebuilt as necessary to comply with the standards of the Municipality at the
completion of the construction of the buildings and without expense to the
Municipality, until final acceptance of final pavement for maintenance and use.
      (2)    Except for pavement construction referred to in subsection (a)(l)
hereof, the developer shall construct asphalt pavement in accordance with the
"Detailed Specifications for Asphalt Paving" as prepared by the Municipal
Engineer and on file with the Municipality. All other pertinent provisions of
subsection (a)(l) shall apply to the construction of the pavement authorized in
this subsection.
      (3)    In residential subdivisions where the smallest lot is at least
24,000 square feet and where, in the opinion of the Engineer, the topography is
undulating such that lot grades shall create difficulties in construction, then
the developer may elect to construct an asphalt pavement in accordance with
subsection (a)(2) hereof or, alternatively, an asphalt pavement with flush
curbs and no gutters provided that such construction is in accordance with the
"Detailed Specifications for Rural Asphalt Pavement" as prepared by the
Engineer and on file with the Municipality. All other pertinent provisions of
subsection (a)(l) hereof shall apply to the construction of the pavement
authorized in this subsection.
   (b)    Curbs and Gutters. Where required in subsection (a)(l) hereof,
concrete roll curbs integral with the pavement shall be constructed as required
in the district where the subdivision is located. Concrete roll curbs and
gutters shall be in accordance with the "Detailed Specifications for Concrete
Paving" of the Engineer. Straight curbs may be provided at intersections where
rolled curbs are used elsewhere. However, where pavement construction is in
accordance with subsection (a)(2) hereof, the developer shall construct
vertical concrete curbs integral with the pavement and in accordance with the
"Detailed Specifications for Asphalt Paving" as prepared by the Engineer and on
file with the Municipality.
   (c)    Driveways and Curb Cuts. Driveways and curb cuts should be located
along the lowest side of the lot, not less than three feet from the side lot
line or another driveway. Driveways shall be not less than eight feet and not
more than sixteen feet wide in one family districts. Curb cuts for straight
curbs and the flare for rolled curbs of driveways shall be three to five feet
wider than the driveway pavement on each side; the driveway grade of the apron

      (Ord. 85-5. Passed 4-15-85.)
   (e)    Public Sidewalks. In residential subdivisions where streets are
constructed pursuant to subsection (a)(3) hereof, sidewalks shall not be
constructed contemporaneous with the street construction. The developer shall
grade the treelawn on both sides of the street so that sidewalks may be
constructed at a future date. Such grading shall be done in conformance with
the standards on file with the Engineer. However, all sidewalks shall be made
available on vacant lots when fifty-one percent (51%) of the lots in the
development have been sold or two years of time has elapsed since the
development was opened for sale, whichever first occurs. (Ord. 93-35. Passed 9-
20-93.)
         On local residential streets, sidewalks shall be located in the public
right-of-way so that the inner line is approximately six inches from the
property line. On corner lots each sidewalk shall be extended to the curb. In
residential developments walks shall be not less than five feet wide and not
less than ten feet wide in business developments.
         Sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete four inches thick. The
design and construction shall be in accordance with the standards on file with
the Engineer.
         In residential subdivisions where streets are constructed pursuant to
subsection (a)(3) hereof, sidewalks shall not be constructed contemporaneous
with the street construction. The developer shall grade the treelawn on both
sides of the street so that sidewalks may be constructed at a future date. Such
grading shall be done in conformance with the standards on file with the
Engineer.
      (Ord. 85-5. Passed 4-15-85.)

   1119.11 STREET TREES.
   (a)    Spacing and Selection. The selection and spacing of trees shall be in
accord with a street tree plan approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
Trees should be planted along new streets at an interval of fifty feet. Tree
species should be selected with such habit of growth that they shall fill the
space desired within a reasonable time, producing a pleasing effect in scale
with adjacent developments. Miniature tree species should not be used except
for special design considerations of scale, such as in a mall, and not used
merely as a means of reducing pruning and a tree care program. Trees of untried
species, of unknown endurance or those requiring frequent spraying should not
be used. Trees generally recommended along streets are Red Maple, Norway Maple,
Sugar Maple, Red Oak, White Oak, Thornless Honey Locust, London Plane, Amur
Cork and Sweet Gum. Trees which have undesirable characteristics such as
excessively thick foliage, low branches, unpleasant odors, susceptibility to
disease or attack by insects or which have large root systems, such as Poplar,
Willow, Cottonwood, American Elm, various nut and fruit trees, Ailanthus,
Mountain Ash and Oregon Maple shall not be planted in any tree lawn.
   (b)    Tree Planting Program. A tree planting program should be prepared by
qualified landscape architects for trees along the public streets and public
areas. Such program should consider the species to be used on specific streets
along with regulations controlling spacing and also controlling the distance
from curbs, street intersections, private driveways and street lights. Such
program should be in accordance with the objectives of Policy No. 29, January,
1964, of the American Society of Landscape Architects.
   (c)    Specifications. All trees planted pursuant to this section shall
include the following as minimum specifications for each such tree:
      (1)    The minimum caliper of each tree planted, regardless of species,
shall be two and one-half inches. The caliper measurement shall be taken twelve
inches above the ground line.
      (2)    The minimum height for each tree planted shall be in relation to
its caliper and species, and in accordance with the standards of the American
Nurseryman's Association.
      (3)    All trees planted shall be balled and burlapped.
      (4)    All trees planted shall survive one full growing season after the
date it is planted. If, before the expiration of one full growing season after
the date it is planted, any such tree is either dead or in poor condition,
based on the opinion of the Municipal Landscape Architect, it shall be replaced
by the developer during the next planting season.
   (d)    Inspections. All trees planted pursuant to this section shall be
inspected by the Municipal Landscape Architect to assure that all requirements
herein have been fulfilled.
(Ord. 81-52. Passed 10-5-81.)
   1119.12 STREET NAME SIGNS.
   Street name signs shall be furnished and installed by the developer. The
design of the signs shall be in accord with the present signs as approved by
the Municipality. Signs shall be placed on diagonally opposite corners, on the
far right hand of the intersection for traffic on the more important street and
as close to the corner as possible.
(Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1119.13 EXTRA-SIZE AND OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS.
   The utilities, pavements and other land improvements as required shall be
designed of extra size and/or extensions provided as may be necessary to serve
nearby land which is an integral part of the neighborhood service or drainage
area in addition to the improvements required for the development of the
proposed subdivision.
   (a)    Extra-Size Improvements. The developer shall be required to pay a
part of the improvements but shall not be required to pay for that part of the
materials or construction of the pavements of arterial streets, trunk sewers or
water mains which are determined by the Municipal Engineer, according to
standards set forth in this chapter, to be in excess of the size required for
the development of the subdivision and the integral neighborhood service or
drainage area.
         If a storm sewer, a sanitary sewer or a water main in excess of the
size necessary to service the development is required, but each less in size
than the sewer trunk lines or water mains which are to be constructed and
financed on a regional basis, the Municipality may construct the extra-size
utility and require a deposit in advance from the developer for the cost of the
utility he is required to install and his portion of other costs which the
Municipality may assess against the benefitted property owners of the service
or drainage area.
   (b)    Extensions to Boundaries. The developer shall be required to extend
the necessary improvements to the boundary of the proposed subdivision to serve
adjoining unsubdivided land, as determined by the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
   (c)    Off-Site Extensions. If streets or utilities are not available at the
boundary of a proposed subdivision, and if the Commission finds the extensions
across undeveloped areas would not be warranted as a special assessment to the
intervening properties or as a municipal expense until some future time, the
developer may be required, prior to approval of the final plat, to obtain
necessary easements or right of way and construct and pay for such extensions.
Such improvements shall be available for connections by developers of adjoining
land.
   (d)    Prorating Costs. In making determinations for prorating costs for the
construction of off-site extensions or extra-size improvements, the Commission
and Council shall consider in addition to the standards set forth in this
chapter and other regulations of the Municipality the following conditions:
      (1)    The relative location and size of the proposed subdivision; and
      (2)    The traffic estimated to be generated by the development in
relation to present streets; and
      (3)    The natural drainage area for sewers and the service area for
water; and
      (4)    The development benefits that will accrue to the subdivision; and
      (5)    The sequence of land and utility developments in the vicinity; and
      (6)    Any other condition it may find pertinent.
         (Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1119.14 DESIGN STANDARDS FOR IMPROVEMENTS.
   The design of the water system, storm and sanitary sewerage systems and
roadways, the grading of the subdivision and each lot shall be in accord with
the various aforesaid standards and requirements. Drawings and specifications
for the improvements shall be reviewed and approved by the Municipal Engineer
and the installation shall be subject to his continuous inspection.
   At the completion of the construction, and before acceptance, the developer
shall furnish the Municipality a set of records or "as-built" tracings showing
the locations, sizes and elevations of all underground utilities.
(Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1119.15 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE IN LIEU OF INSTALLATION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   Concurrently with the application for approval of the final plat, the
developer may execute and file with the Municipality a performance bond,
secured as hereinafter required, in lieu of actual installation or completion
of required improvements.
   (a)    Form of Bond. The performance bond shall be conditioned upon proper
installation of all improvements required by the Codified Ordinances of the
Municipality, according to the approved plans and specifications, within two
years after approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission or Council of the
final plat of the subdivision, and shall provide that the Municipality shall
have the right, in the event of default, to install the required improvements
after first giving ten days written notice to the developer, to proceed against
the developer and against any surety on the bond for the cost thereof and to
apply to the cost of such improvements any funds deposited with the
Municipality or in escrow as security for performance of the conditions of the
bond. The bond shall further provide that the developer shall hold harmless the
Municipality, its officers and employees from all claims, demands and causes of
action of every nature and description arising out of the installation of
improvements within the developer's subdivision, conditions existing during the
construction or installation of such improvements and all damages to
neighboring property owners resulting from approval of the developer's
subdivision by the Municipality and the installation of improvements therein,
including, without limitation, damages resulting from increase in surface water
flowing from the subdivision and all claims arising out of changes to natural
ditches or drainage courses. The terms "claims, demands and causes of action",
shall include all expenses of defending against such claims, demands and causes
of action, including fees payable to attorneys and expert witnesses, wages paid
to Municipal employees while occupied in defense of such claims, demands and
causes of actions and wages or salaries reimbursed by the Municipality to
Municipal officers to compensate them for wages and salaries lost while engaged
in such defense. The form of each performance bond shall be approved in writing
by the Director of Law and shall be in a form substantially as shown in
Appendix B of original Ordinance 79-86.
   (b)    Security for Bond. Performance bonds shall be secured as follows:
      (1)    By the written guarantee of one or more surety companies
authorized to conduct business within the State of Ohio. The form of guarantee
shall be approved in writing by the Director of Law. The Director may reject a
performance bond in the event that he reasonably determines that the assets of
the surety company or companies, subject to attachment within the State of
Ohio, are insufficient to secure performance of the developer's obligations,
taking into account other outstanding liabilities and contingent liabilities of
the surety company or companies; or
      (2)    By deposit of cash in the full face amount of the bond, with the
Municipality or with an escrow agent or trustee. In the event funds are
deposited with an escrow agent or trustee, all documents or instruments
governing the terms of such deposit shall be approved in writing by the
Director.
   (c)    Amount of Bond. The amount of performance bonds shall be determined
by the Municipal Engineer and shall be in an amount equal to the estimated
total cost of materials and labor required to install or construct all
improvements required by the Codified Ordinances of the Municipality, including
the estimated cost of repairing or reconstructing public improvements outside
the subdivision which may be damaged by construction activity. The amount of a
performance bond shall also include estimated damages, if any, to neighboring
properties which are the subject of the hold harmless provision contained in
subsection (a) hereof, and the estimated costs of defending against claims for
any such damages.
   (d)    Reduction of Bond and Return of Security. When the Engineer shall
have certified in writing that all subdivision improvements have been
satisfactorily completed in accordance with approved plans and specifications,
the performance bond submitted by the developer shall be canceled and all funds
deposited as security therefor shall be returned. Upon written certification by
the Engineer that any portion of the improvements has, upon inspection, been
found satisfactorily completed, a reduction in the amount of the bond or
partial withdrawal of funds deposited as security therefor, equal to the cost
of such completed improvements, as estimated by the Engineer, may be authorized
by the Engineer if, in the opinion of the Engineer the remaining bond or
security shall be fully sufficient, under all the circumstances, to guarantee
performance of the conditions of the bond. In the event that the developer
shall have been required to post a maintenance bond for the same subdivision,
pursuant to the requirements of Section
1119.16, the Municipality may retain so much of the funds posted as security
for the developer's performance bond as may, in the judgment of the Engineer,
be necessary to provide adequate security for the performance of the conditions
of the developer's maintenance bond.
   (e)    Progressive Installation. The developer may apply for final approval
and recording of only a portion of the entire subdivision. Under such a
progressive unit development procedure, the installation of required
improvements and sale or lease of lots may proceed only on that portion of the
subdivision which has been approved and recorded.
      (Ord. 79-86. Passed 12-3-79.)
   1119.16 CERTIFICATION OF COMPLETION; MAINTENANCE BOND.
   (a)    Certification of Completion. With respect to all improvements which
have been installed by the developer prior to the granting of final approval of
the subdivision, the Municipal Engineer shall furnish to the Planning and
Zoning Commission, at the time that request is made for final approval, a
certification that all such improvements have been constructed and installed
according to the approved plans therefor, and are ready for use and that they
have been approved by the various agencies whose approval is required.
(Ord. 85-5. Passed 4-15-85.)
   (b)    Maintenance Bond. The developer shall furnish to the Municipality a
maintenance bond in the amount of the total cost of all improvements which have
been installed. This bond shall be conditioned on the proper operation of these
improvements for a period of three years from the date of the granting of the
final approval. The bond shall provide that the Municipality shall be held
harmless and free of tort and contract claims of third persons, with the right
given to the Municipality to effect any necessary repair or correction of these
improvements during such three year period and hold the principal and surety
jointly and severally liable on the bond. Before the Municipality exercises its
right to effect any necessary repairs or correction to the required
improvements during such three year period it shall first give a ten day
written notice to the developer of its intention to do so.
(Ord. 90-30. Passed 7-16-90.)
   1119.17 INSURANCE.
   The developer agrees to indemnify and save harmless the Municipality against
and from any and all loss, cost, damage, liability and expense on account of
damage to property of, or injury to or death of, the Municipality and any of
its employees, agents or representatives or any third person, caused by,
growing out of or in any way whatsoever attributable to the construction of the
improvements and the use of the street delineated on the subdivision plat
during construction. The developer further agrees, but without limiting its
liability to indemnify the Municipality to carry liability insurance contracts
with any insurance company or companies authorized to do business in Ohio and
with an A.M. Best rating acceptable to the Village during the period of the
construction in the sum of one million dollars ($1,000,000) combined single
limit for injury to or death of persons or destruction of property, which
insurance contracts shall include the Municipality as a named insured. The
developer agrees to maintain on file with the Municipality during the period of
the construction, certificates or memoranda of insurance evidencing that the
insurance contracts are in force.
(Ord. 2009-61. Passed 12-21-09.)
   1119.171 IDENTIFICATION OF LOT BOUNDARIES.
   The developer shall install metal pins indicating the location of
subdivision lot boundaries which pins need not be installed prior to grading
but which shall be permanently affixed to the parcels prior to the issuance of
an occupancy permit. The developer shall furnish to the Building Commissioner a
certificate evidencing the placement of the pins as required by this section.
(Ord. 79-40. Passed 7-16-79.)

December 3, 1979.)
   1119.19 TEMPORARY STREET PAVEMENT; BUILDING PERMIT AND TEMPORARY CERTIFICATE
OF OCCUPANCY; BOND.
   A building permit may be issued and construction started after the
completion of the underground utilities. If a temporary pavement is
constructed, a temporary certificate of occupancy, which shall include a
statement that the Municipality is not liable for maintenance of such
improvements, may be issued, provided the developer furnishes a cash bond in an
amount required by the Municipality, guaranteeing that all streets shall be
maintained in a passable and reasonable condition until such time as the final
pavement is completed and accepted for use and maintenance as set forth in
Section
1119.09(a).
(Ord. 69-38. Passed 4-20-70.)
   1119.20 SEDIMENT POLLUTION CONTROL REGULATIONS.
   (a)    No developer shall conduct any earth disturbing activities unless the
same are performed in accordance with the Sediment Pollution Control
Regulations which are on file at the Civic Center and available for inspection
or copying, the same being incorporated herein as if totally rewritten.
   (b)    Any developer who performs any earth disturbing activities in
violation of these Regulations shall for each and every violation or
noncompliance be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000). Each day
during or on which a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.

be dedicated or deeded to public use or to be reserved by covenants in deeds to
the sublots thereof for the common use of all property owners within the
proposed subdivision.
   In determining such reasonable suitability, consideration shall be given to
such factors as the topography of the area to be so allocated, the major
physical characteristics of such area, the location thereof in relation to the
remaining area of the subdivision, the shape of the area, to be so allocated
and other similar consideration relative to a determination of whether or not
the area to be so allocated can be reasonably used for schools, playgrounds or
park or recreation areas. If the Commission, applying the standards set forth
in this section, finds that the area to be so allocated for schools,
playgrounds or park and recreation areas is reasonably suitable for such uses,
and if it further finds that the area to be so allocated is equal to or greater
than the minimum area required by subsection (b) hereof to be dedicated or
deeded to the Municipality for public park or recreation uses, the requirements
of subsection (b) hereof shall not be applicable to such subdivision and there
shall be no requirement that land shall be dedicated or deeded to the
Municipality for public park or recreational uses as a condition precedent to
the approval of a subdivision by the Commission.
   (b)    Mandatory Dedication of Area for Park and Recreation Uses. In the
interests of public safety, health and welfare, to provide proper open spaces
for circulation of light and air and to avoid future congestion of population
detrimental to the public safety, health and welfare, no subdivision plat shall
be approved by the Commission, except as provided in subsections (a), (c) and
(d) hereof unless in addition to all other lawful requirements, after deducting
the area of such subdivision to be dedicated or deeded for public street,
sidewalk or utility purposes, eight percent (8%) of the balance of the area of
such subdivision is dedicated or deeded to the Municipality for public park or
recreational uses, provided that the area to be so dedicated or deeded to the
Municipality for public park or recreational uses shall be reasonably suitable,
in the judgment of the Commission, for use as a public park or recreational
area. In determining such reasonable suitability, the Commission shall consider
such factors as the topography of the area to be so dedicated or deeded, the
major physical characteristics of such area, the location thereof in relation
to the remaining area of the subdivision, the shape of the area to be so
dedicated or deeded and other similar considerations as in the judgment of the
Commission are relative to a determination of whether or not the area to be so
dedicated or deeded can reasonably be used for public park or recreational
purposes.
   (c)    Exceptions and Considerations. Notwithstanding the requirement of
subsection (b) hereof, the Commission shall have authority, after public notice
and hearing as provided in subsection (e) hereof, to determine that it would
not be adverse to the interests of public safety, health and welfare to provide
proper open spaces for circulation of light and air and the avoidance of future
congestion of population detrimental to the public safety, health and welfare,
to approve a subdivision plan wherein less than the minimum area required by
subsection (b) hereof is dedicated or deeded to the Municipality for public
park or recreational uses when it is further determined by the Commission,
after such public notice and hearing, that it would be unreasonable to require
the minimum area as set forth in subsection (b) hereof to be so dedicated or
deeded and that practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship would result
from such requirement. In making such determination, the Commission shall
consider such factors as the following:
      (1)    The aggregate area of the subdivision after deducting the area to
be dedicated or deeded for public street, sidewalk or utility purposes;
      (2)    The topography of the subdivision;
      (3)    The major physical characteristics of the land within the area of
the subdivision;
      (4)    The aggregate area of the subdivision, after deducting the area to
be dedicated or deeded for public street, sidewalk or utility purposes, which
can reasonably be developed for uses authorized under the Planning and Zoning
Code;
      (5)    The uses which may be made of the proposed subdivision under the
Planning and Zoning Code and the density of population which reasonably would
result from such permitted uses;
      (6)    The proximity of existing public park or recreational areas with
consideration given to whether or not such existing public park or recreational
areas would reasonably satisfy the need for public park and recreational areas
within the proposed subdivision;
      (7)    Proposed deed restrictions and setback lines;
      (8)    Other exceptional conditions as in the judgment of the Commission
are relative to a reasonable determination of the area of land to be dedicated
to the Municipality for public park and recreational uses; and
      (9)    Whether or not the refusal to approve a subdivision plan with less
than the minimum area required by subsection (b) hereof to be dedicated or
deeded to the Municipality for public park or recreational uses would deprive
the owner of the subdivision of substantial property rights.
   (d)    Alternate Requirement for Small Subdivisions. Recognizing that in
certain cases, subdivisions may be of such a minimum area that it would be
unreasonable under any circumstances to require any land therein to be
dedicated or deeded to the Municipality for public park or recreational areas,
neither subsection (b) nor subsection (c) hereof shall apply. In such cases, in
lieu of setting aside lands for park and recreation purposes, the developer
shall pay over to the Municipality the sum of three hundred dollars ($300.00)
for each lot shown on all subdivision plats submitted for approval. Such funds
shall be deposited in a special account for providing and maintaining open
space for parks and recreation in the Municipality. No subdivision plat shall
be approved or streets dedicated to public use until such funds have been paid
to the Municipality.
   (e)    Public Notice of Hearings. Public notice as required by subsection
(c) hereof shall mean a notice posted for fifteen days in five of the most
public places in the Municipality, as determined by Council, and published one
time in a newspaper of general circulation in the Municipality. The notice
shall set forth that a subdivision plat, stating the name thereof, has been
submitted to the Commission, that the owner thereof has requested that it be
approved by the Commission pursuant to subsection (c) hereof, although less
than the minimum area required by subsection (b) is to be dedicated to the
Municipality for public park or recreational uses, and the place, date and time
that a public hearing shall be held on the request. The notice shall be
published at least ten days prior to the date of such hearing and posted so
that fourteen full days elapse between the day the notice is posted and the
date of the hearing.
   (f)    Grading and Seeding Lands Allocated for Public Use. In those cases
where land is allocated to public use as provided in subsection (a) hereof or
is to be dedicated or deeded to the Municipality for public park or
recreational uses pursuant to subsections (b) or (c) hereof, the owner of the
proposed subdivision, prior to approval of the subdivision plot, shall grade
such area and plant it with grass seed of such quality and character, and in
such amount, as is reasonably suitable for park or recreational uses, or in
lieu thereof, he may furnish a one hundred percent (100%) performance bond. The
amount of such bond shall be determined in the manner provided by Section
1119.15, in the case of a subdivision improvement bond. The form of such bond
and the security therefor shall be a s provided in Section
1119.15.
   (g)    Title Guaranty Required. In those cases where land is to be deeded or
dedicated to public use as required by subsections (a), (b) or (c) hereof,
other than land reserved by covenants in deeds to the sublots of a proposed
subdivision for the common use of all property owners within the proposed
subdivision, the proposed streets of such subdivision shall not be dedicated to
public use until the owner of such proposed subdivision delivers a good and
sufficient warranty deed conveying title in such deeded land to the
Municipality free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, taxes and assessments,
both general and special, except zoning and building ordinances.
   Prior to the dedication to public use of the streets within such proposed
subdivision, the deed shall be deposited with an escrow agent selected by the
Director of Law under such instructions as the Director may deem proper to
effectuate the purposes of this section. The deed shall be recorded by the
Director upon the acceptance of such streets for dedication and the issuance of
a title guaranty in the amount of the value of the land, which title guaranty
shall show good title in the Municipality free and clear of all liens,
encumbrances, taxes and assessments, both general and special, except zoning
and building ordinances of record. All escrow fees, the recording fees and the
cost of the title guaranty shall be paid by the developer.
   (h)    Penalty. Whoever violates any provision of this section shall be
fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00). Each succeeding day of
continued violation, after notice thereof, shall constitute a separate offense.

   1123.99 ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTY.
   Compliance with the Subdivision Regulations shall be obtained by applying
penalties for noncompliance as follows:
   (a)    Violations of Rules and Regulations. Whoever violates any provision
of these Regulations as duly adopted or fails to comply with any order issued
pursuant thereto, shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000).
Each violation shall be considered a separate offense.
   (b)    Improvements to be Installed. The utilities and other improvements
required by these Regulations and deemed necessary in the public interest to
provide essential services and access to a lot shall be installed or their
installation guaranteed, in conformance with the provisions of these
Regulations before the issuance of a building permit for construction upon the
lot and before the recording, sale or lease of the lot.
   (c)    Transfer of Land Before Recording. Whoever, being the owner or agent
of the owner of any land located within the jurisdiction of these Regulations,
transfers any lot, parcel or tract of such land, or in accordance with any plat
of a subdivision before such plat has been recorded, shall be fined not more
than five hundred dollars ($500. 00) for each lot, parcel or tract of land
sold. The description of such lot, parcel or tract by metes and bounds in the
deed of transfer shall not serve to exempt the seller from the forfeit herein
provided. The Municipality may enjoin such sale or agreement by a civil action
in any court of competent jurisdiction. The sale of lots, parcels or tracts
from a plat of a subdivision on which any and all areas indicated as streets or
as open ground are expressly indicated as for the exclusive use of the abutting
or other owners in such subdivision and not as public streets, ways or grounds

   1125.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of Mayfield Village, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The Village has special flood hazard areas that are
subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Mayfield
Village as identified in Section
1125.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
Mayfield Village.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective December 3, 2010.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
       (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village as required by Section
1125.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Mayfield Village Civic Center, 6622 Wilson Mills
Road, Mayfield Village, Ohio 44143.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances (resolutions) including Subdivision
Regulations, Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict between these
regulations and any other ordinance (resolution), the more restrictive shall be
followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or
easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the
regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on these
regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)    Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations
be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision
shall not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part
thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2010-35. Passed 8-16-10.)
   1125.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure. A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)    Appeal. A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)    Base Flood. The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to
as the one percent (1%) chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)    Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE). The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)    Basement. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)    Development. Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,

storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)    Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor.  See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)    Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management). Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)    Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)    Fill.  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)    Flood or Flooding. general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)    Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)    Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)    Flood Insurance Risk Zones. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)    Flood Insurance Study (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation plus [1] feet of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)    Floodway. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)    Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)    Historic structure. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by Mayfield Village's historic preservation program, which program is certified
by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)    Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)    Letter of Map Change (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)    Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)    Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The

purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)    Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)    National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)    New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village Flood Insurance
Rate Map, December 24, 1976, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   (aa)    Person. Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
General Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General's Department, or
any court.

professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ee)    Registered Professional Surveyor. A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ff)    Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from
other federal, state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)    Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a

before the damage occurred.
   (jj)    Substantial Improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)    Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)    Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations. (Ord. 2010-35. Passed 8-16-10.)

minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the Village flood maps, studies and other data identified in
Section
1125.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1125.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1125.03(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1125.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor, and may be
submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority
over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain
management regulations for a particular area. In order that the Village's Flood
Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the Village boundaries, include within
such notification a copy of a map of the Village suitable for reproduction,
clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the Village
has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1125.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor and the Mayor of any other
communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1125.04(i)(1)B., items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1125.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 2010-35. Passed 8-16-10.)
   1125.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established. The Mayfield Village Board of Appeals is
hereby appointed to serve as the Appeals Board for this chapter in accordance
with Village Charter
Article V, Section 12.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1125.05(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Board of Appeals provided that such
person shall file, within thirty (30) days of the date of such notice and
order, or other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such
hearing or for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the
Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by
the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of
the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Board of Appeals.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Board of Appeals shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Board of Appeals shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Board of Appeals.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set forth in the schedule of fees adopted by Mayfield
Village, Ohio.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Board of Appeals shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Board of Appeals shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances,
as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (5)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1125.05(d)(3)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board of
Appeals may appeal such decision to the Cuyahoga Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 2010-35. Passed 8-16-
10.)
   1125.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1125.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
Section
1125.06(c).
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with Section
1125.06(c).
   (b)   Notice of Violation. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall
give notice of such violation to the person responsible therefore and order
compliance with these regulations as hereinafter provided. Such notice and
order shall:
      (1)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;

express mail or any other commercial carrier service utilizing any form of
delivery requiring a signed receipt to the person's last known mailing address,
residence, or place of business, and/or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place
in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a 4th degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of the Village. Each day such violation continues shall be
considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the
Village from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation. The Village shall prosecute any violation of these
regulations in accordance with the penalties stated herein.

   1127.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   It is hereby determined that the system of rivers, streams, and other
natural watercourses within Mayfield Village contributes to the health, safety,
and general welfare of the residents of the Mayfield Village. The specific
purpose and intent of this regulation is to regulate uses and developments
within riparian setbacks that would impair the ability of riparian areas to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of flood waters, and regulating base flow.
      (2)   Assist stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce woody debris
from fallen or damaged trees, streambank erosion, and the downstream transport
of sediments eroded from watercourse banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants already present in
watercourses.
      (4)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering, settling, and
transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses.
      (5)   Provide watercourse habitats with shade and food.
      (6)   Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain a
diverse aquatic system.
      (7)   Provide habitat to a wide array of wildlife by maintaining diverse
and connected riparian vegetation.
      (8)   Benefit Mayfield Village by minimizing encroachment on watercourse
channels and the need for costly engineering solutions such as gabion baskets
and rip rap to protect structures and reduce property damage and threats to the
safety of watershed residents; and by contributing to the scenic beauty and
environment of Mayfield Village, and thereby preserving the character of
Mayfield Village, the quality of life of the residents of Mayfield Village, and
corresponding property values.
   (b)   The following regulation has been enacted to protect and enhance these
functions of riparian areas by providing reasonable controls governing
structures and uses within a riparian setback along designated watercourses in
Mayfield Village.

      (Ord. 2013-10. Passed 8-19-13.)
   1127.05 ESTABLISHMENT OF DESIGNATED WATERCOURSES AND RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   (a)   Designated watercourses shall include those watercourses meeting any
ONE of the following criteria:
      (1)   All watercourses draining an area greater than ½ square mile, OR
      (2)   All watercourses draining an area less than ½ square mile and
having a defined bed and bank. In determining if watercourses have a defined
bed and bank, Mayfield Village may consult with a representative of the
Cuyahoga SWCD or other technical experts as necessary. Any costs associated
with such consultations may be assessed to the applicant.
   
   (b)   Riparian setbacks on designated watercourses are established as
follows:
      (1)   A minimum of 75 feet on either side of all watercourses draining an
area greater than ½ square mile and up to 20 square miles.
      (2)   A minimum of 25 feet on either side of all watercourses draining an
area less than ½ square mile and having a defined bed and bank as determined by
Mayfield Village in Section
1127.05 of this regulation.
   (c)   Riparian Setback Map. Mayfield Village shall create a map identifying
designated watercourses and their riparian setbacks. Said map is attached
hereto and made part of this regulation and is identified as Exhibit A. The
following shall apply to the Riparian Setback Map:
      (1)   It shall be used as a reference document and the information
contained therein shall be believed to be accurate.
      (2)   It shall be a guide only.
   Communities should add the following disclaimer language to this map. “This
map was prepared as a Riparian Setback Map by Mayfield Village in accordance
with Section
1127.05 of Chapter
1127. Mayfield Village digital data is a representation of recorded plats,
surveys, deeds, and other collected information for use within a Geographic
Information System for purposes of analysis. These and other digital data do
not replace or modify land surveys, deeds, and/or other legal instruments
defining land ownership or use. Mayfield Village assumes no legal
responsibility for this information.”
      (3)   Nothing herein shall prevent Mayfield Village from amending the
Riparian Setback Map from time to time as may be necessary.
      (4)   If any discrepancy is found between the Riparian Setback Map and
this regulation, the criteria set forth in Section
1127.05(a) and (b) shall prevail.
   (d)   The following conditions shall apply in riparian setbacks:
      (1)   Riparian setbacks shall be measured in a horizontal direction
outward from the ordinary high water mark of each designated watercourse,
except for in-line ponds as addressed in Section
1127.05.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in this regulation, riparian setbacks
shall be preserved in their natural state.
      (3)   Where the 100-year floodplain is wider than a minimum riparian
setback on either or both sides of a designated watercourse, the minimum
riparian setback shall be extended to the outer edge of the 100-year
floodplain. The 100-year floodplain shall be defined by FEMA. If a FEMA defined
floodplain does not exist for a designated watercourse, Mayfield Village may
require a site-specific floodplain delineation in conformance with standard
engineering practices and approved by Mayfield Village. Any costs associated
with reviewing this site-specific floodplain delineation may be assessed to the
applicant.
      (4)   Where a wetland is identified within a minimum riparian setback,
the minimum riparian setback width shall be extended to the outermost boundary
of the wetland. Wetlands shall be delineated through a site survey prepared by
a qualified wetlands professional retained by the landowner using delineation
protocols accepted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the time an
application is made under this regulation. Any costs associated with reviewing
these delineations may be assessed by Mayfield Village to the applicant.
      (5)   The minimum riparian setback on an in-line pond existing at the
time of application of this regulation shall be measured from the ordinary high
water mark of the designated watercourse as it enters said pond and through the
impoundment along the centerline of the designated watercourse as it flows
through the in-line pond. Riparian setbacks on inline ponds existing at the
time an application is made under this regulation shall be expanded to include
wetlands and floodplains as detailed in Section
1127.05. The creation of new in-line impoundments shall not be permitted under
these regulations. (Ord. 2013-10. Passed 8-19-13.)
   1127.06 APPLICATIONS AND SITE PLANS.
   (a)   The applicant shall be responsible for delineating riparian setbacks
as required by this regulation and shall identify such setbacks on a site plan
included with all subdivision plans, land development plans, and/or zoning
permit applications submitted to Mayfield Village. The site plan shall be
prepared by a professional engineer, surveyor, landscape architect, or such
other qualified professional as determined by Mayfield Village and shall be
based on a survey of the affected land. Two (2) copies of the site plan shall
be submitted. The site plans shall include the following information:
      (1)   The boundaries of the lot with dimensions.
      (2)   The locations of all designated watercourses.
      (3)   The limits, with dimensions, of the riparian setbacks.
      (4)   The existing topography at intervals of two (2) feet.
      (5)   The location and dimensions of any proposed structures or uses,
including proposed soil disturbance, in relationship to all designated
watercourses.
      (6)   North arrow, scale, date, and stamp bearing the name and
registration number of the qualified professional who prepared the site plan.
      (7)   Other such information as may be necessary for Mayfield Village to
ensure compliance with this regulation.
   (b)   Mayfield Village may, in reviewing the site plan, consult with the
Cuyahoga SWCD or other such experts. Any costs associated with this review may
be assessed to the applicant.
   (c)   If soil disturbing activities will occur within 50 feet of the outer
boundary of the applicable riparian setback as specified in this regulation,
the riparian setback shall be clearly identified by the applicant on site with
construction fencing as shown on the site plan. Such identification shall be
completed prior to the initiation of any soil disturbing activities and shall
be maintained throughout soil disturbing activities.
   (d)   No approvals or permits shall be issued by Mayfield Village prior to
identification of riparian setbacks on the affected land in conformance with
this regulation.
(Ord. 2013-10. Passed 8-19-13.)
   1127.07 USES PERMITTED IN RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   (a)   By Right Uses Without A Permit. Open space uses that are passive in
character shall be permitted in riparian setbacks, including, but not limited
to, those listed in this regulation. No use permitted under this regulation
shall be construed as allowing trespass on privately held lands.
      (1)   Recreational Activity. Hiking, fishing, hunting, picnicking, and
similar passive recreational uses, as permitted by federal, state, and local
laws.
      (2)   Removal of Damaged or Diseased Trees. Damaged or diseased trees may
be removed.
      (3)   Revegetation and/or Reforestation. Riparian setbacks may be
revegetated and/or reforested with native, noninvasive plant species.
   (b)   By Conditional Use Permit Granted by the Planning and Zoning
Commission: When granting Conditional Use Permits for the following uses, the
Planning and Zoning Commission may, for good cause, attach such conditions as
it deems appropriate. Permits issued under this regulation are issued to the
applicant only, shall not be transferred, and shall be void if not implemented
within one (1) year of issuance.
      (1)   Crossings: Crossings of designated watercourses through riparian
setbacks with roads, driveways, easements, bridges, culverts, utility service
lines, or other means may be permitted provided such crossings minimize
disturbance in riparian setbacks and mitigate any necessary disturbances. Such
crossings shall only be undertaken upon approval of a Crossing Plan by the
Planning and Zoning Commission. Any costs associated with review of Crossing

   1127.10 VARIANCES WITHIN RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant a variance to this regulation as
provided herein. In granting a variance, the following conditions shall apply:
      (1)   In determining whether there is unnecessary hardship with respect
to the use of a property or practical difficulty with respect to maintaining
the riparian setback as established in this regulation, such as to justify the
granting of a variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider the
potential harm or reduction in riparian functions that may be caused by a
proposed structure or use.
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may not authorize any structure or use
in a Zoning District other than those authorized in the Zoning Code.
      (3)   Variances shall be void if not implemented within one (1) year of
the date of issuance.
   (b)   In making a determination under Section
1127.10(a) of this regulation, the Board of Zoning Appeals may consider the
following:
      (1)   The natural vegetation of the property as well as the percentage of
the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain. The criteria of Chapter
1125 Flood Damage Prevention may be used as guidance when granting variances in
the 100-year floodplain.
      (2)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood
control, erosion control, water quality protection, or other functions of the
riparian setback. This determination shall be based on sufficient technical and
scientific data.
      (3)   The degree of hardship, with respect to the use of a property or
the degree of practical difficulty with respect to maintaining the riparian
setback as established in this regulation, placed on the landowner by this
regulation and the availability of alternatives to the proposed structure or
use.
      (4)   Soil-disturbing activities permitted in the riparian setback
through variances should be implemented to minimize clearing to the extent
possible and to include Best Management Practices necessary to minimize erosion
and control sediment.
      (5)   The presence of significant impervious cover, or smooth vegetation
such as maintained lawns, in the riparian setback compromises its benefits to
Mayfield Village. Variances should not be granted for asphalt or concrete
paving in the riparian setback. Variances may be granted for gravel driveways
when necessary.
      (6)   Whether a property, otherwise buildable under the ordinances of
Mayfield Village, will be made unbuildable because of this regulation.
   (c)   In order to maintain the riparian setback to the maximum extent
practicable, the Board of Zoning Appeals may consider granting variances to
other area or setback requirements imposed on a property by the Planning and
Zoning or Building Codes. These may include, but are not limited to, parking
requirements, requirements for the shape, size, or design of buildings, or
front, rear, or side lot setbacks.
   (d)   In granting a variance under this regulation, the Board of Zoning
Appeals, for good cause, may impose such conditions that it deems appropriate
to maintain the purposes of this regulation and to mitigate any necessary
impacts in the riparian setbacks permitted by variance. In determining
appropriate mitigation, the Board of Zoning Appeals may consult with the
Village Engineer or other agencies including Cuyahoga SWCD.

   1128.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable stormwater management standards to achieve a level
of stormwater quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the Village:
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the Village to:
      (1)   Control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all
Stormwater Control Measures (SCMs) are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and groundwater are
protected, and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and groundwater recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the Village's future
expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section
1128.01.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Cuyahoga County, and the
Village shall comply with this regulation for linear projects within public
rights-of way (e.g., roadway and sidewalk projects).
   (e)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface as
determined by Mayfield Village Engineer or Ohio EPA. Such projects must be
designed to minimize the number of stream crossings and the width of
disturbance. Linear construction projects must comply with the requirements of
Chapter
1129 Erosion and Sediment Control of the Village's Codified Ordinances.

   1128.08 COMPREHENSIVE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLANS.
   Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan Required: The applicant shall
develop a Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan describing how the quantity
and quality of stormwater will be managed after construction is completed for
every discharge from the site and/or into a water resource or small municipal
separate storm sewer system (MS4).
Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans must meet the requirements in the
Construction General Permit and these regulations.
   (a)   Preparation by Professional Engineer: The Comprehensive Stormwater
Management Plan shall be prepared by a registered Professional Engineer and
include supporting calculations, plan sheets, and design details. To the extent
necessary, as determined by Mayfield Village Engineer, a site survey shall be
performed by a registered Professional Surveyor to establish boundary lines,
measurements, or land surfaces.
   (b)   Community Procedures: The Village Engineer shall prepare and maintain
procedures providing specific criteria and guidance to be followed when
designing the stormwater management system for the site. These procedures may
be updated from time to time, at the discretion of the Village Engineer based
on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring, and local maintenance
experience. The Village Engineer shall make the final determination of whether
SCMs proposed in the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan meet the
requirements of this regulation.
   (c)   Contents of Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan: The
Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan must contain all elements and meet all
requirements specified in the Construction General Permit. It shall also meet
the following requirements.
      (1)   Location information: The application shall note the phase, if
applicable, of the overall development plan and list sublot numbers if the
project is a subdivision.
      (2)   Site maps and SCM design plans: It is preferred that all SCMs and
the entire site be shown on one plan sheet to allow a complete view of the site
during plan review. If a smaller scale is used to accomplish this, separate
sheets providing an enlarged view of areas on individual sheets should also be
provided. Existing and proposed drainage patterns and any relevant offsite SCMs
should be depicted. For each SCM, include the following:
         A.   An individual identification number;
         B.   Location and size;
         C.   Final site conditions and detail drawings of stormwater inlets
and permanent SCMs. Details of SCMs shall be drawn to scale and shall show
relevant volumes, elevations, and sizes of contributing drainage areas;

      (3)   Required Calculations: The applicant shall submit calculations for
projected stormwater runoff flows, volumes, and timing into and through all
SCMs for flood control, channel protection, water quality, and the condition of
the habitat, stability, and incision of each water resource and its floodplain.
These submittals shall be completed for both pre- and post-development land use
conditions and shall include the underlying assumptions and hydrologic and
hydraulic methods and parameters used for these calculations. The applicant
shall also include critical storm determination and demonstrate that the runoff
from offsite areas have been considered in the calculations. For each SCM,
identify the drainage area and size in acres, percent impervious cover within
the drainage area, volumetric runoff coefficient, peak discharge, and the time
of concentration for each sub-watershed. Pervious and impervious areas should
be treated as separate sub-watersheds unless allowed at the discretion of the
Village Engineer. Identify the SCM surface area, discharge and dewatering time,
outlet type and dimensions.
      (4)   Inspection and Maintenance Agreement. The Inspection and
Maintenance Agreement required for SCMs under this regulation is a stand-alone
document between the Village and the applicant.
      (5)   Inspection and Maintenance Plan. This plan will meet the
requirements of the Construction General Permit and will be developed by the
applicant and reviewed by the Village Engineer. Maintenance requirements of
each SCM during and after construction should be included. Once the Inspection
and Maintenance Plan is approved, a recorded copy of the Plan must be provided
to the property owner or association that will be responsible for long-term
operation and maintenance of the BMP and submitted to the Village Engineer as
part of the final inspection approval as described in Section
1128.12.
         (Ord. 2022-18. Passed 10-17-22.)
   1128.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General: The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, twenty-four (24)-hour storm event; to maintain
predevelopment runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; to meet the requirements of
the Construction General Permit; and to meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated SCMs that address degradation of water resources. The
SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the water resources receiving stormwater
discharges from the site. Acceptable SCMs shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project and complies with Chapter
1127 Riparian Setbacks of the the Village Codified Ordinances.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable. Where feasible, bioretention, permeable
pavement with infiltration, underground storage with infiltration, infiltration
trenches, infiltration basins, and/or rainwater harvesting must be the water
quality SCMs used. Separate SCMs may be used for peak discharge control and
water quality treatment.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
         E.   Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of Rainwater and Land Development Manual or another design
manual acceptable for use by the Village and Ohio EPA.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use: SCMs shall be designed to achieve
the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be compatible with
the proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Chapter
1128, as well as pertinent provisions of the Village Codified Ordinances
regulating subdivisions, shall provide stormwater management and water quality
controls for the development of all subdivided lots. This shall include
provisions for lot grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding during
the 100-year, twenty-four (24)-hour storm; and maintain, to the extent
practicable, the pre-development runoff patterns, volumes, and peaks from each
lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources: SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as
required in Section
1128.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1129 Erosion and Sediment Control of the Village Codified Ordinances, all as
determined by Mayfield Village Engineer.
      (5)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels: All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, twenty-four (24)-hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and
conveyance channels, the applicant shall consider public safety as a design
factor and alternative designs must be implemented where site limitations would
preclude a safe design.
      (6)   Exemption: The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
1128.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the stormwater
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing SCM, or if the
stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by SCMs defined in
a regional or local stormwater management plan approved by the Village
Engineer.
      (7)   Maintenance:  All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements approved by the Village.
(8)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the Village, SCMs serving
multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot held and maintained by
an entity of common ownership. SCMs serving single lots shall be placed on
these lots, protected within an easement, and maintained by the property owner.
      (9)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage: Practices that preserve
the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum extent practicable.
Such practices may include minimizing site grading and compaction; protecting
and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and existing vegetation and
vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction operations in order to
minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time, and designation of tree
preservation areas or other protective clearing and grubbing practices; and
maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and through these areas.
      (10)   Post-Construction Soil Restoration: Except for areas that will be
covered by impervious surface or have been incorporated into an SCM, the soil
moisture- holding capacity of areas that have been cleared and graded must be
restored to that of the original, undisturbed soil to the maximum extent
practicable. Areas that have been compacted or had the topsoil or duff layer
removed should be amended using the soil profile restoration design criteria in
the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
   (b)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria: All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Surface water protection: The Village Engineer may allow
modification to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only
if the applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from
the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and
local agencies as required in Section
 1128.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1129 Erosion and Sediment Control of the Village Codified Ordinances, all as
determined by the Village Engineer. At a minimum, stream relocation designs
must show how the project will minimize changes to the vertical stability,
floodplain form, channel form, and habitat of upstream and downstream channels
on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges: Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or the stormwater quality
control facility shall be sized to treat the off-site flow. Comprehensive
Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved until it is demonstrated to
the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that off-site runoff will be
adequately conveyed through the development site in a manner that does not
exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow: The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. The sheet flow
length shall not exceed seventy-five (75) feet from impervious area or one
hundred and fifty (150) feet from pervious areas. Flow shall be directed into
an open channel, storm sewer, or other SCMs from areas too long and/or too
large to maintain sheet flow, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
      (4)   Open channels:  Unless otherwise allowed by the Village Engineer,
drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with vegetated
banks and designed to carry the ten (10)-year, twenty-four (24)-hour stormwater
runoff from upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under the Village's zoning or where the use of an open drainage system
affects public health or safety, all as determined by the Village Engineer. The
following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems when necessary:
         A.   Uniform Standards for Sewerage Improvements, Latest Edition shall
be followed.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
systems is twelve (12) inches unless smaller is approved by the Village
Engineer. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems, subject to the
approval of the Village Engineer.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the Village:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum twenty-five (25)-year, twenty-four
(24)-hour storm. However, a fifty (50)-year or 100 year, twenty-four (24) hour
design may be required by the Village Engineer.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers, cold-
water habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high-water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
percent (25%) of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of one (1) foot of box
culverts and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or
conveyance must be sized to carry the twenty-five (25)-year storm under these
conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be twelve (12) inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a ten
(10)-fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions.
Erosion protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly
control entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of five (5) square miles or larger
shall incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict
head loss differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-
year storm event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100-year,
twenty-four (24) hour storm, or the 100-year flood elevation as determined by
FEMA, whichever is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding: Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100-year, twenty-four (24)-hour storm event
to an adequate receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is
contained within the drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not
cause flooding of buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water
surface elevation along flood routing paths shall be at least two feet below
the finished grade elevation of all structures. When designing the flood
routing paths, the conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be
taken into consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the Village must be
compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume. First consideration for
the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be given to areas
where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new floodplain
within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also be given to
enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for floodplain
fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing watershed. Unless
otherwise permitted by the Village, reductions in volume due to floodplain
fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of the development.
Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must reasonably conform to
the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The use of vertical
retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control: The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one (1) or more SCMs that meet or exceed the criteria in the
Construction General Permit.
   (d)   Stormwater Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a one (1)-year, twenty-four (24)-
hour storm occurring on the same development drainage area under pre-
development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, twenty-four (24)-hour storm shall have peak
runoff discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent
size storms under pre- development conditions. The one (1), two (2), five (5),
ten (10), twenty-five (25), fifty (50), and 100-year storms shall be considered
in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method or other
hydrologic method approved by the Village Engineer, the total volume (acre-
feet) of runoff from a one (1)-year, twenty-four (24)-hour storm occurring on
the development drainage area before and after development. These calculations
shall meet the following standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Drainage area maps for both pre-developed and post-developed
conditions shall include area, curve number, and time of concentrations. Time
of concentration shall also show the flow path and the separation in flow type.
            4.   Use the Standard Rainfall Intensity - Duration Tables from the
Uniform Standards for Sewerage Improvements, Latest Edition for stormwater
design.
            5.   Use the SCS Type II rainfall distribution for all design
events with a recurrence interval greater than one (1) year. Include lot
coverage assumptions used for full build out of the proposed condition.
            6.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition shall reflect
the average type of land use over the past 10 years and not only the current
land use.
               i.   Pre-development Curve Numbers - For wooded or brushy areas,
use listed values from TR-55 NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
1986 in good hydrologic condition. For meadows, use listed values. For all
other areas (including all types of agriculture), use pasture, grassland, or
range in good hydrologic condition.
               ii.   Post-development Curve Numbers - Open space areas shall
use post-construction hydrologic soil groups from the Rainwater and Land
Development Manual unless the soil is amended using the soil profile
restoration design criteria in the Rainwater and Land Development Manual. All
undisturbed areas or open space with amended soils shall be treated as "open
space in good condition."
            7.   Time of Concentration - Use velocity-based methods from (TR-55
NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow, and channel flow.
               i.   Maximum sheet flow length is 100 feet.
               ii.   Use the appropriate "unpaved" velocity equation for
shallow concentrated flow from Soil Conservation Service National Engineering
Handbook Section 4 - Hydrology (NEH-4).
            8.   The volume reduction provided by runoff reduction SCMs may be
subtracted from the post-development stormwater volume. Volume reductions for
these SCMs may be demonstrated using methods outlined in the Rainwater and Land
Development Manual or a hydrologic model acceptable to the Village Engineer.
         B.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways except in instances of engineered permeable
pavement systems. From the volume determined in Section
1128.09(d)(3)(A), determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the twenty-four (24)-hour Critical
Storm from Table 3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff
is:                                               The Critical Storm will be:
Equal to or Greater than: and Less Than:
---                       10                      1 year
10                        20                      2 year
20                        50                      5 year
50                        100                     10 year
100                       250                     25 year
250                       500                     50 year
500                       ---                     100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a one (1)-year storm is thirty-five percent (35%), the
Critical Storm is a five (5)-year storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff
for all storms up to this frequency shall be controlled so as not to exceed
the peak discharge rate from the one (1)-year frequency storm under pre-
development conditions in the development drainage area. The post-development
runoff from all less frequent storms need only be controlled to meet pre-
development peak discharge rates for each of those same storms.
   (e)   Stormwater Management for Previously Developed Areas.
      (1)   SCMs on previously developed sites must meet the criteria in the
Construction General Permit.
         (Ord. 2022-18. Passed 10-17-22.)
   1128.10 ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   (a)   When the Village determines that site constraints compromise the
intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in an
improvement of water quality and a reduction of stormwater quantity. Such
alternatives shall meet the standards in the Construction General Permit and
shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity control that would be
achieved by the on-site controls required under this regulation. The Village
Engineer may require proof of Ohio EPA review and approval for any alternative
action proposed.
(Ord. 2022-18. Passed 10-17-22.)
   1128.11 EASEMENTS.
   Access to SCMs as required by the Village Engineer for inspections and
maintenance shall be secured by easements. The following conditions shall apply
to all easements:
   (a)   Easements shall be included in the Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement submitted with the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.
   (b)   Easements shall be approved by the Village prior to approval of a
final plat and shall be recorded with the Cuyahoga County Auditor and on all

   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the Village Engineer, access easements
between a public right-of-way and all SCMs shall be no less than fifteen (15)-
feet wide. The easement shall also incorporate the entire SCM plus an
additional fifteen (15)-foot-wide band around the perimeter of the SCM.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
   (e)   Easements to SCMs shall be restricted against the construction therein
of buildings, fences, walls, and other structures that may obstruct the free
flow of stormwater and the passage of inspectors and maintenance equipment; and
against the changing of final grade from that described by the final grading
plan approved by the Village. Any re-grading and/or obstruction placed within a
maintenance easement may be removed by the Village at the property owners'
expense.
      (Ord. 2022-18. Passed 10-17-22.)
   1128.12 MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
   To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed by the applicant and provided to the
Village Engineer:

   1128.13 ON-GOING INSPECTIONS.
   The owner shall inspect SCMs regularly as described in the Inspection and
Maintenance Plan and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement. The Village has the
authority to enter upon the property to conduct inspections as necessary, with
prior notification of the property owner, to verify that the SCMs are being
maintained and operated in accordance with this regulation. Upon finding a
malfunction or other need for maintenance or repair, the Village shall provide
written notification to the responsible party, as detailed in the Inspection
and Maintenance Agreement, of the need for maintenance. Upon notification, the
responsible party shall have ten (10) working days, or other mutually agreed

(Ord. 2022-18. Passed 10-17-22.)
   1128.15 BOND.
   (a)   If a Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan is required by this
regulation, soil- disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a cash
bond of ten percent (10%) of the total project cost has been deposited with the
Village Finance Department. This bond shall be posted for the Village to
perform the obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner of the
development area as stated in this regulation and to allow all work to be
performed as needed in the event that the applicant fails to comply with the
provisions of this regulation. The stormwater bond will be returned, less
Mayfield Village administrative fees as detailed in Chapter
1128 of the Village's Codified Ordinances, when the following three (3)
criteria are met:
      (1)   The site has been stabilized, temporary BMPs have been removed, and
the sediment settling basin has been converted to or replaced with post-
construction SCM(s) and one of the following conditions are met:
         A.   One hundred percent (100%) of the total project has achieved
permanent stabilization.
         B.   Less than one (1) acre of lots remain unbuilt.
         C.   No development activities have occurred for one (1) year.
      (2)   An As-Built Certification of all SCMs is approved by the Village
Engineer.
      (3)   An Inspection and Maintenance Plan has been approved by the Village

   1128.16 INSTALLATION OF WATER QUALITY STORMWATER CONTROL MEASURES.
   The applicant may not direct runoff through any water quality structures or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the Village Engineer. This occurs after the completion of the
final grade at the site, after all the utilities are installed, and the site is
subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other appropriate methods. The
developer must provide documentation acceptable to the Village Engineer to
demonstrate that the site is completely stabilized. Upon this proof of
compliance, the water quality structure(s) may be completed and placed into
service. Upon completion of installation of these SCMs, all disturbed areas
and/or exposed soils caused by the installation of these practices must be
stabilized within two (2) days.

   1129.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
stage of construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls.
BMP selection and design must meet criteria established within the current
Construction General Permit. BMPs must be designed, constructed, and installed
to meet the specifications in the Rainwater and Land Development Manual or
another design manual acceptable to the Village. The approved SWP3, and the
sediment and erosion controls, and non-sediment pollution controls contained
therein, shall be implemented and maintained according to the requirements in
the Construction General Permit. Site operators must conduct site inspections
as described in the Construction General Permit.
   Certified inspection reports shall be submitted to the Village Engineer
within seven (7) working days from the inspection and retained at the
development site.
   The following standards will also apply:
   (a)   BMPs must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site
and that dust is controlled. These BMPs must include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These entrances
shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled concrete, or
cement sized greater than two (2) inches in diameter placed over a geotextile.
Culverts shall be provided where construction entrances cross drainage ditches
and water bars shall be provided to divert sediment-laden runoff away from
connected roadways.
      (2)   Streets and catch basins adjacent to construction entrances shall
be kept free of sediment tracked off site. Streets directly adjacent to
construction entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall
be cleaned daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch
basins on these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall also be
cleaned weekly and protected from sediment-laden runoff, if feasible without
posing a public safety hazard.
      (3)   Based on site conditions, the Village Engineer and/or the Cuyahoga
County SWCD may require additional best management practices to control off
site tracking and dust. These additional BMPs may include:
         A.   Fencing shall be installed around the perimeter of the
development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to designated
construction entrances.
         B.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The Village Engineer and/or the Cuyahoga
County SWCD may require dust controls including the use of water trucks to wet
disturbed areas, tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed
areas, and regulation of the speed of vehicles on the site.
   (b)   Construction Vehicles Shall Avoid Water Resources. If it is infeasible
to provide and maintain an undisturbed natural buffer around water resources,
the SWP3 shall comply with all the following additional requirements:
      (1)   All stream crossings shall be designed as specified in the most
recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
      (2)   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water resources
or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during construction.
      (3)   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
      (4)   Protected areas or critical areas, including wetlands and riparian
areas shall be physically marked in the field prior to earth disturbing
activities.
   (c)   For sites that will not be completed by October 1, a Pre-Winter

registered surveyor, certified professional erosion and sediment control
specialist, or a registered landscape architect.
   (c)   The Abbreviated SWP3 shall include a minimum of the following BMPs.
The Village Engineer may require other BMPs as site conditions warrant.
      (1)   Construction Entrances: Construction entrances shall be built and
shall serve as the only permitted points of ingress and egress to the
development area. These entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of
aggregate stone or recycled concrete or cement sized greater than two (2)
inches in diameter and placed over a geotextile fabric.
      (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be indicated on the
plan. Use for other waste and wastewater is prohibited.
      (3)   Street Sweeping: Streets directly adjacent to construction
entrances and receiving traffic from the development area shall be cleaned
daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on
these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall be cleaned weekly.

Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed.
      (5)   Inlet Protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed on storm water catch basins located
on the subject property and, if there is no threat to public safety, on curb
inlets closest to the construction entrance, to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems, including rear yard inlets.
      (6)   Silt Fence and Other Perimeter Controls. Silt fence and other
perimeter controls approved by the Village Engineer shall be used to protect
adjacent properties and water resources from sediment discharged via sheet
(diffused) flow. Silt fence shall be placed along level contours and the
permissible drainage area is limited to those indicated in in the Construction
General Permit.
      (7)   Internal Inspection and Maintenance. All controls on the
development area shall be inspected at least once every seven (7) calendar days
and within twenty-four (24) hours after any storm event greater than one-half
inch of rain per twenty-four (24) hour period. Maintenance shall occur as
detailed below:
         A.   When BMPs require repair or maintenance. If the internal
inspection reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         B.   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function. If the
internal inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function
and that another, more appropriate control practice is required, the
Abbreviated SWP3 must be amended, and the new control practice must be
installed within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         C.   When BMPs depicted on the Abbreviated SWP3 are not installed. If
the internal inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the BMP must be implemented within ten (10) days
from the date of the inspection. If the inspection reveals that the planned
control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of
explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
      (8)   Final Stabilization: Final stabilization is achieved when the site
has reached eighty percent (80%) cover and when the Village Engineer approves
the site condition. (Ord. 2022-19. Passed 10-17-22.)
   1129.11 FEES.
   The SWP3 and Abbreviated SWP3 review, filing, and inspection fee is part of
a complete submittal and is required to be submitted to the Village and if
directed, the Cuyahoga County SWCD before the review process begins. Please
consult with the Village Building Department for current fee schedule. (Ord.
2022-19. Passed 10-17-22.)

   1130.07 DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   Prohibition of Illicit Discharges. No person shall discharge, or cause
to be discharged, an illicit discharge into the MS4. The commencement, conduct,
or continuance of any illicit discharge to the MS4 is prohibited except as
described below:
      (1)   Water line flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted stream flows;
rising ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration (infiltration is
defined as water other than wastewater that enters a sewer system, including
sewer service connections and foundation drains, from the ground through such
means as defective pipes, pipe joints, connections, or manholes. Infiltration
does not include, and is distinguished from, inflow); uncontaminated pumped
ground water; discharges from potable water sources; foundation drains; air
conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs; water from crawl space
pumps; footing drains; lawn watering; individual residential car washing; flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands; dechlorinated/ debrominated/ desalinated
swimming pool discharges; street wash water with dry cleanup method and no
detergents to minimize pollutants; discharges or flows from fire-fighting
activities; dye tests. These discharges are exempt until such time as they are
determined by the Village or Ohio EPA to be significant contributors of
pollutants to the MS4.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the Village as being necessary
to protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Discharges from off-lot discharging household sewage treatment
systems existing prior to January 1, 2007 and permitted by the Cuyahoga County
Board of Health for the purpose of discharging treated sewage effluent in
accordance with Ohio Administrative Code 3701-29, or other applicable Cuyahoga
Board of Health regulations, until such time as the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency issues an NPDES permitting mechanism for household sewage
treatment systems existing prior to January 1, 2007. These discharges are
exempt unless such discharges are deemed to be creating a public health
nuisance by the Cuyahoga County Board of Health. Discharges from new or
replacement off-lot household sewage treatment systems installed after January
1, 2007, are not exempt from the requirements of this regulation.
In compliance with the Village Storm Water Management Program, discharges from
all off- lot discharging household sewage treatment systems must either be
eliminated or have coverage under an appropriate NPDES permit issued and
approved by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. When such permit coverage
is available for systems existing prior to January 1, 2007, discharges from
off-lot discharging household sewage treatment systems existing prior to
January 1, 2007, will no longer be exempt from the requirements of this
regulation.
   (b)   Prohibition of Illegal Connections. The construction, use,
maintenance, or continued existence of illegal connections to the MS4 is
prohibited.
      (1)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illegal
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (2)   A person is considered to be in violation of this regulation if the
person connects a line conveying illicit discharges to the MS4 or allows such a
connection to continue.

subject to this regulation for the purposes of illicit discharge inspection is
a violation of this regulation.
      (6)   If the Village is refused access to any part of the facility from
which storm water is discharged, and the Village demonstrates probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this regulation, or that there is a
need to inspect and/or sample as part of an inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this regulation or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, the Village
may seek issuance of a search warrant, civil remedies including but not limited
to injunctive relief, and/or criminal remedies from any court of appropriate
jurisdiction.
      (7)   Any costs associated with these inspections shall be assessed to
the facility owner/operator.

required, the Notice of Violation shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said Notice shall further advise
that, should the facility owner/operator fail to remediate or restore within
the established deadline, a legal action for enforcement may be initiated.
   (c)   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation must meet compliance
standards within the time established in the Notice of Violation.
   (d)   Administrative Hearing: If any member of the Village administration
makes any adverse decision under the authority vested by this chapter, that
decision may be appealed by any person adversely affected thereby to the
Village Planning and Zoning Commission by sending a letter to the Building
Commissioner within ten (10) days of the decision. Planning and Zoning
Commission shall place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting occurring
not less than ten (10) days after receipt of the letter by the Building
Commissioner. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hear the appeal, and
make a recommendation to Village Council within sixty (60) days of the filing
of the letter requesting the appeal, unless the appellant consents to a longer
period of time. In the event the Planning and Zoning Commission does not decide
the issue within sixty (60) days of the filing of the letter requesting the

   1130.10 REMEDIES NOT EXCLUSIVE.
   The remedies listed in this regulation are not exclusive of any other
remedies available under any applicable federal, state, or local law and it is

(Ord. 2022-20. Passed 10-17-22.)
   1130.11 SANITARY SEWER SURCHARGE REDUCTION AND ELIMINATION POLICY.
   (a)   Background.
      (1)   The Village recognizes that inflow and infiltration (I/I) of storm
water into the sanitary sewer system during rain events exists. It is the
Village's policy to work with the Cuyahoga County Department of Public Service,
who is contracted to maintain the sanitary sewer system, to address problems
related to I/I. It is the goal of the Village and County to remove inflow and
infiltration from the system wherever possible and practical.
      (2)   As a measure to afford property owners some level of protection and
relief from inflow and infiltration backup into their basements while the
Village and County work to reduce and eliminate I/I from the system, the
Village hereby establishes the following policies and procedures for the
installation of backflow devices or other measures necessary to reduce and/or
eliminate the basement flooding caused by a surcharge into the sanitary sewer
system.
   (b)   Funding.
      (1)   The Village will establish a fund to be used for the program.
      (2)   The fund will be used to reimburse property owners for costs
incurred in the installation of backflow devices and/or the reconfiguration of
plumbing to eliminate or reduce basement flooding caused by surcharge of the
sanitary sewer main.
      (3)   The total number of reimbursements available in any calendar year
shall be limited to the appropriation of funds for the program established in
the yearly appropriations ordinance.
            (4)    The Village will make request to Cuyahoga County for
reimbursement of funds used for this program from sanitary sewer maintenance
fees collected by the County for maintenance of the sewer collection system.
            (5)    Reimbursement for the installation of backflow devices and/
or the reconfiguration of plumbing shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%)
of the total cost of labor and materials in an amount not to exceed one
thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) per property.
            (6)    Property owners failing to follow the policies and
procedures established contemporaneously herewith by the Village may be deemed
ineligible for reimbursement.
   (c)    Permitting.
      (1)    In order to qualify for this funding, property owner shall first
be required to complete an application for reimbursement.
      (2)    Prior to the commencement of any work to be performed, a permit
must be obtained from the Building Department.
      (3)    The Building Department will make an inspection of the property's
existing plumbing to determine the following:
         A.    That all private side plumbing is properly connected to the
public system;
         B.   Suitability of the planned method of relief (i.e. a backflow
device, stand pipe, overhead plumbing, etc.) and;
         C.   Verification that inflow and infiltration (I/I) surcharge from
the public sewer system may be an attributable cause of basement flooding.
            (4)    If the inspection reveals I/I emanating from private
property or other causes which would prove the proposed relief method
ineffective, the property owner will be required to correct the deficiency.
            (5)    Contractors are required to be registered with the Cuyahoga
County Department of Public Works, Division of Sanitary Engineers and with the
Mayfield Village Building Department.
            (6)    Verification of the completion of all work and approval of
the reimbursement application to the satisfaction of the Building Commissioner
and recommendation that the Director of Finance make reimbursement to the
property owner.
   (d)    Moral Claims.
            (1)    In cases where special and/or unique conditions exists,
property owners may seek compensation for expenses beyond those authorized by
this policy through the moral claims process as set forth by the Village.
            (2)    Property owners who have installed or modified plumbing as a
means to prevent a back up of the public sanitary sewer system prior to the
adoption of this policy may seek reimbursement through the moral claims process
in accordance with Chapter
159 of the regulation.

   (b)    Purpose. Conditional uses are those uses having some special impact
or uniqueness that requires a careful review of the location, design,
configuration, and impact to determine, against the fixed standards set forth
in Section
1149.02(h), Standards for Conditional Use Permits, the desirability of
permitting the establishment of a conditional use on any given site.
Conditional uses may or may not be appropriate in a particular location
depending on a weighing, in each case, of the public need and benefit against
the local impact and effect and such other standards and factors established
herein or by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (c)    Parties Entitled To Seek Conditional Use Permits. An application for
a conditional use permit may be filed by any person, firm or corporation, or by
any office, department, board, bureau, or commission which has a legal interest
in the property in the form of an ownership, a lease, or a purchase agreement
for the property for which the conditional use permit is requested. If the
applicant is a lessor, the written approval, with signature, of the owner shall
be required as
determined necessary by the Building Commissioner.
   (d)    Application for a Conditional Use Permit. An application for a
conditional use permit shall be filed with the Building Commissioner on an
official, prescribed form. The application shall be accompanied by the
following plans, data or information, as applicable, unless determined
otherwise by the Building Commissioner or designee:
      (1)    A statement in writing by the applicant and adequate evidence
showing that the proposed conditional use will conform to the standards set
forth in Section
1149.02(h), Standards for Conditional Use Permits. Such information should
include, at a minimum, a description of the use, days and hours of operation,
number of employees, the scope of proposed activities, and any other
information requested by the Building Commissioner.
      (2)    If the use is not listed as a permitted conditional use under
Section
1153.02(e) or (f), a statement in writing explaining how it is similar to a use
which is listed as a permitted conditional use under the applicable Section of
1153.02(e) or (f).
      (3)    A site plan of the proposed use identifying the location of all
buildings, structures, pavement, open space, points of ingress/egress and
parking layout for the subject property; existing buildings, structures and
pavement on the abutting properties within one hundred (100) feet of the
subject property line; and all property lines, rights-of-way, parcel numbers,
easements, scale, north arrow and date shall also be clearly shown.
      (4)    The existing use and zoning of land within three hundred (300)
feet of the subject property.
      (5)    If the subject property is contained in a multi-tenant building,
the application should identify the proposed space to be occupied.
      (6)    Estimated traffic generation of the proposed use.
      (7)    Floor plans indicating the internal use of structures.
      (8)    An accurate legal description of the subject property.
      (9)    Other information, including a narrative description or product
information as may be required by the Planning and Zoning Commission. At the
time of application, the applicant has the option to include a landscape plan
showing all proposed and existing landscaping, berming, buffering and
screening; architectural elevations, and an exterior lighting plan indicating
the location of all lighting fixtures. Such application shall be forwarded from
the Building Commissioner to the Planning and Zoning Commission for review.
   (e)    Notice of Request and Public Hearing. No conditional use permit shall
be considered by the Planning and Zoning Commission until reasonable advance
notice of the request and the date and time of a Public Hearing before the
Planning and Zoning Commission has been sent to all property owners within
three hundred (300) feet of the subject property and all adjoining and facing
property owners. However, failure of service on any individual property owner
will not nullify any conditional use permit granted by the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
   (f)    Action by Planning and Zoning Commission. After the conclusion of the
public hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall take action on the
application for a conditional use permit and transmit its action to Council.
The Planning and Zoning Commission may approve, approve with conditions, or
deny the application for a conditional use permit. If the Planning and Zoning
Commission approves the application, with or without conditions, the Commission
shall transmit the application to Council for Council's confirmation. If the
Planning and Zoning Commission denies the application, the application process
ends. Disapproval of the application for a conditional use permit by the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall include a statement of the reasons for the
denial.
   (g)    Action by Council. Within a reasonable time after the receipt of the
decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission approving or approving with
conditions a conditional use permit, the Council either shall confirm the
decision by resolution duly adopted with or without modifications or
conditions, refer the application back to the Planning and Zoning Commission
for further study, or deny the conditional use permit.
   (h)    Standards for Conditional Use Permits. The Planning and Zoning
Commission or Council shall make a determination on conditional use permit
applications based on the following criteria and subject to Section
1149.02(i) below:
      (1)    Land Use Policy. The proposed use and development will be in
keeping with the land use and planning policies established by the
Municipality, including any Master Plan then in effect.
      (2)    Ordinance Purposes. The proposed use and development will be in
harmony with the general and specific purposes for which this Zoning Code was
enacted and for which the regulations of the district in question were
established.
      (3)    No Nuisance. The proposed use and development will not create any
public nuisance by reason of noise, smoke, odors, vibrations, objectionable
lights or congestion of traffic.
      (4)    No Undue Adverse Impact. The proposed use and development will not
have a substantial or undue adverse impact upon adjacent property, the
character of the neighborhood or area, property values in the immediate
vicinity, or the public peace, health, safety, and general welfare.
      (5)    No Interference with Surrounding Development. The proposed use and
development will be constructed, arranged, and operated so as not to
excessively interfere with the use and development of neighboring property in
accordance with the applicable district regulations.
      (6)    Adequate Public Facilities. The proposed use and development will
have no undue financial burden on the Municipality and be served adequately by
the existing level of essential public facilities and services such as streets,
public utilities, drainage structures, police and fire protection, refuse
disposal, parks, libraries, and schools. If the existing level of public
facilities and/or services is or may be inadequate, the applicant must commit
to adequately providing such services for itself.
      (7)    No Traffic Congestion. The proposed use and development will not
cause undue traffic congestion nor draw significant amounts of traffic through
residential streets.
      (8)    No Destruction of Significant Features. The proposed use and
development will not result in unnecessary destruction, loss, or damage of any
natural, scenic, or historic feature of significant importance.
      (9)    Compliance with Standards. The proposed use and development
complies with all additional standards imposed on it by the particular
provision(s) of this Section of the Zoning Code authorizing such use and any
other applicable provisions of the Zoning Code imposed on the proposed use if
the use is permitted in another Use District.
      (10)    Community Benefit. The proposed use will provide benefit to the
community because the proposed use is not currently or commonly available in
the Municipality.
      (11)    Economic Impact. The proposed use has the potential to create a
positive economic impact by creating or expanding employment opportunities and
increasing tax revenue within the Municipality.
   (i)    Application of Standards for Conditional Use Permit. While the
standards set forth in Section
1149.02(h) will be used to evaluate specific applications for conditional use
permits, the Planning and Zoning Commission is not required to approve any
conditional use permit solely based upon meeting any or all of the standards.
Approval shall be in the sole and exclusive discretion of the Planning and
Zoning Commission and Council.
   (j)   Conditions on Conditional Use Permits. The Planning and Zoning
Commission may impose and Council may confirm or impose additional conditions
and limitations concerning the use, construction, character, location,
landscaping, screening, and other matters relating to the purposes and
objectives of this Section of the Zoning Code, upon the premises benefited by a
conditional use permit, as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or
minimize adverse effects upon other property and improvements in the vicinity
of the subject property or upon public facilities and services. Such conditions
shall be expressly set forth in the resolution granting the conditional use or
expressly included in such resolution by reference. Violation of any such
condition or limitation shall be a violation of the Zoning Code and shall
constitute grounds for revocation of the conditional use permit.
   (k)    Confirmation of Compliance with Conditions. Whenever any conditional
use permit granted pursuant to this Section is made subject to conditions or
limitations to be met by the applicant, the applicant shall, upon meeting such
conditions, notify the Building Commissioner for inspection of compliance. The
Building Commissioner shall determine whether the applicant has met the
conditions. Thereafter, the Building Commissioner shall inspect the premises
every four (4) years for compliance to said specific terms, conditions and
safeguards. The Building Commissioner shall provide a report to the Planning
and Zoning Commission summarizing the inspections and, if in compliance,
recommending renewal of the conditional use permit.
   (l)    Effect of Issuance of a Conditional Use Permit. The granting of a
conditional use permit authorizes the property to be used in the manner
proposed but does not alone authorize the establishment or extension of any
use, nor the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving
of any building or structure without first obtaining any other required permit,
including a building permit.
   (m)    Limitations on Conditional Use Permit. Subject to an extension of
time authorized by the Planning and Zoning Commission, no conditional use
permit shall be valid for a period longer than one (1) year unless a building
permit is issued and construction is actually begun within that period, and is
thereafter diligently pursued to completion, or the approved use is commenced
within that period. Thereafter, a conditional use permit shall be valid for a
period of four (4) years and shall expire on December 31 st of the fourth year
following the year in which the permit was granted. The Building Commissioner
shall provide a report to the Planning and Zoning Commission summarizing the
inspections conducted under Section
1149.02(k). Thereafter, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall renew the
conditional use permit if the permit holder has complied with all terms and
conditions established by the Planning and Zoning Commission in granting the
conditional use permit.
   (n)    Modifications to Conditional Uses. Any modification or
intensification of a conditional use that alters the essential character or
operation of the use in a way not intended at the time the conditional use
permit was granted, as evidenced by the record or language of the resolution,
shall require a new conditional use permit. The property owner/operator or
their authorized representative shall apply for such conditional use permit
prior to any modification of the use of property. The Building Commissioner
shall determine whether the proposed modification or intensification represents
an alteration in the essential character of the original conditional use as
approved. The operator of the conditional use shall provide the Building
Commissioner with all the necessary information related to the conditional use
to render this determination. If the Building Commissioner determines that the
proposed modification or intensification will not alter the essential character
or operation of the conditional use, a new conditional use permit shall not be
required.
   (o)    Revocation of Conditional Use Permit. A conditional use permit may be
revoked by the Building Commissioner if the established conditions for approval
are violated. Any party who is the holder of a conditional use permit that has
been revoked pursuant to this Section, may appeal the decision of the Building
Commissioner to the Planning and Zoning Commission within ten (10) days of
receiving notice of the revocation of the conditional use permit.
(Ord. 2022-10. Passed 8-15-22.)
   1149.03 FILING FEES.
   Each application to the Planning and Zoning Commission, each application to
the Board of Appeals requesting a variance and each petition to Council for an
amendment of the zoning regulations or districts shall, unless waived by the
Commission, Board or Council to which such application or petition is
addressed, be accompanied by a filing fee of fifty dollars ($50.00), payable to
the Municipality. However, if the cost of publishing the notice and notifying
property owners in connection with any such application or petition exceeds the
filing fee listed above, then the person filing such application or petition
shall pay the amount of the excess cost to the Municipality before the date of
the hearing on such application or petition. The filing fees shall be paid into
the General Fund of the Municipality.
(Ord. 92-18. Passed 6-1-92.)
 
   1149.04 INTERPRETATION.
   In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Zoning Code, they shall
be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public
health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare. The lot or yard areas
required by this Code for a particular building shall not be diminished and
shall not be included as a part of the required lot or yard areas of any other
building. The lot or yard areas of buildings existing at the time of the
passage of this section (May 20, 1935) shall not be diminished below the
requirements herein provided for buildings hereafter erected and such required
areas shall not be included as a part of the required areas of any building
hereafter erected. This Code shall not repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way
impair or interfere with any existing provisions of law or ordinance or any
rules or regulations previously adopted or issued or which shall be adopted or
issued pursuant to law relating to the use of buildings or premises; nor shall
this Code interfere with or abrogate or annul any easements, covenants or other
agreements between parties. However, where this Code imposes a greater
restriction upon the use of buildings or premises or upon the height of
buildings or requires larger yards than are imposed or required by such
existing provisions of law or ordinance or by such rules, regulations or by
such easements, covenants or agreement, the provisions of this Code shall
control.
(Ord. 159. Passed 5-20-35.)
   1149.05 COMPLETION AND RESTORATION OF EXISTING BUILDINGS.
   Nothing contained in this Zoning Code shall require any change in the plans,
construction or designated use of a building for which a building permit has
been heretofore issued and the construction of which has been diligently
prosecuted within thirty days of the date of such permit, and the ground story
framework of which, including the second tier of beams, has been completed
within six months of the date of such permit, and which entire building shall
be completed according to such plans, as filed, within two years from the date
of the passage of this section (May 20, 1935). Nothing in this Code shall
prevent the restoration of a building wholly or partly destroyed by fire,
explosion, act of God or act of the public enemy, subsequent to the passage of
this section (May 20,1935) or prevent a change of such existing use under the
limitations provided in Section
1149.06. Nothing in this Code shall prevent the restoration of a wall declared
unsafe by the Building Commissioner.
(Ord. 159. Passed 5-20-35.)
   1149.06 NONCONFORMING USES.
   A nonconforming use existing at the time of the passage of this section (May
20, 1935) may be continued. A nonconforming use shall not be extended except as
authorized by Section
1149.05 but the extension of a use to any portion of a building, which portion
was arranged or designed for such nonconforming use at the time of the passage
of this section (May 20,1935), shall not be deemed the extension of a
nonconforming use. A building arranged, designed or devoted to a nonconforming
use at the time of the passage of this section (May 20, 1935) may not be
reconstructed or structurally altered to an extent exceeding in aggregate cost,
during any ten year period, sixty percent of the assessed value of the building
unless the use of the building is changed to a conforming use. A nonconforming
use may not be changed unless changed to a higher use. A nonconforming use if
changed to a conforming use may not thereafter be changed back to any
nonconforming use. A nonconforming use if changed to a higher nonconforming use
may not thereafter be changed unless to a still higher use. A nonconforming use
included in a U-7 use class shall not be changed unless changed to a conforming
use. In a U-1, U-2 or U-3 District a nonconforming use included in a Local
Business District or a U-5 or U-6 use class shall not be changed unless changed
to a conforming use. For the purposes of this Code, a use shall be deemed to be
changed if changed from a use included in a subdivision of a use class to a use
not included in such subdivision. For the purposes of this Code, a
nonconforming use shall be deemed to be changed to a higher use if the use to
which such nonconforming use is changed is a use included in a subdivision of a
use class that in the arrangement of classes and subdivisions in the
classification of uses precedes the subdivision in which such nonconforming use
is included.
(Ord. 159. Passed 5-20-35; Ord. 960. Passed 7-18-66.)
   1149.07 CESSATION OF NONCONFORMING USE.
   If the nonconforming use of any building or property within the Municipality
ceases for any reason for a continuous period of more than six months then any
future use of such building and property shall be in conformity to the uses and
regulations specified by this Planning and Zoning Code for the district in
which such building and property is located. If any building in or on which any
nonconforming use is conducted or maintained is hereafter removed from the
property on which such nonconforming use was conducted or maintained then the
subsequent use of such property and the subsequent location and use of any
building thereon, should the same be moved, shall be in conformity to the uses
and regulations specified by this Planning and Zoning Code for the district in
which such property is located.
(Ord. 87-33. Passed 12-21-87.)
   1149.08 VARIANCES BY COUNCIL.
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: This section was repealed by Ordinance 96-11, passed March
18, 1996.)
   1149.99 PENALTY.
   The owner or owners of any building or premises or part thereof, where
anything in violation of this Zoning Code is placed, or exists, and any
architect, builder or contractor who may be employed to assist in the
commission of any such violation and all persons or corporations who violate
any provision of this Code or fail to comply therewith, or any requirements
thereof or who build in violation of any detailed statement of plans submitted
and approved thereunder, where no other penalty is provided, shall for each and
every violation or noncompliance be fined not more than five hundred dollars
($500.00). Each day during or on which a violation continues shall constitute a

neighboring property, the applicant proposing a fence shall make every effort
to utilize the existing fence. If the existing fence cannot be utilized, there

the area between the two (2) fences. The gate is to be of the same style and
material as the fence. There is to be no storage of any type between the

property lines in the area of the proposed fence; or
         B.   Locate and mark the property corners so they are visible at the
time of inspection; or
         C.   Submit a signed statement from the abutting owner or owners
stating that they approve of the proposed location of the fence.
      (3)    The Municipality shall furnish such inspection as is deemed
necessary to determine that the fence is constructed in accordance with plans
submitted for the permit, provided, however, that the issuance of such permit
by the Municipality shall not be construed to mean the Municipality has
determined the fence is not encroaching upon another lot, nor shall it relieve
the property owner of the duty imposed on him or her herein.

determine that elements of a final development plan are equivalent to a
numerical requirement:
         A.   When the proposed final development plan substantially complies
with all specific requirements and with the purpose, intent and basic
objectives of the zoning district;
         B.   When through imaginative and skillful design in the arrangement
of buildings, open space, streets, access drives, and other features, as
disclosed by the application, the proposal results in a development of
equivalent or higher quality than that which could be achieved through strict
application of such standards and requirements; and
         C.   When the development, as proposed, shall have no adverse impact
upon the surrounding properties or upon the health, safety or general welfare
of the community.
      (2)   When evaluating the application with respect to this subsection,
the Planning and Zoning Commission shall make any finding of equivalency in
writing which explains how and why the proposal has satisfied the above
criteria. When making such finding, the Commission may approve the proposed
application, including waivers from the numerical standards herein, as if the
application were in strict compliance with the standards and requirements in
this Zoning Code.
   (k)   Approval by Village Council. The Village Council shall review the
final development plan as approved by Planning and Zoning Commission. Any
modifications required by Council shall be submitted for approval prior to

and regulations are hereby established in order to achieve among others, the
following purposes:
   (a)    To provide appropriate, convenient and ample districts for motorists
services, office and research activities, and the production and distribution
of goods other than goods offered for sale at retail to the ultimate consumer,
in order to serve and promote economic development of the Municipality and to
utilize the extraordinary transportation facilities; more specifically:
      (1)    To provide Motorist Service Districts in convenient areas directly
related to the freeway interchange to serve the needs of the through and local
motorist, and

freeway system so as to be accessible to widely dispersed administrative and
technical personnel in the region, and
      (3)    To provide Production-Distribution Districts near the freeway
system for uses which generate relatively large volumes of traffic, so as to be
accessible to a large labor force throughout the region, and
   (b)    To protect and stabilize developments from traffic congestion by
regulating the intensity of use, by requiring off-street parking, loading and
on-site circulation facilities, and by regulating the access to streets, and
   (c)    To protect nearby residential neighborhoods by restricting the types
of nearby uses, particularly at their common boundaries, which would create
objectionable influences, and
   (d)    To provide for the immediate development and protection of the area
in the vicinity of the Wilson Mills interchange while a comprehensive plan is
being prepared. (Ord. 763. Passed 9-17-62; Ord. 74-17. Passed 4-15-74.)

   (c)    Landscaping of Yards. Every required yard in which no off-street
parking or loading spaces are permitted and any additional required landscaped
open areas as required in Section
1173.04, shall be developed as lawn or planted areas or maintained in an
orderly natural state. The Commission may also require a fence, wall or hedge
where a certain use adjoins a rear or side yard of a residential district and
such structure or hedge is determined as necessary to further protect such
residential property.
   (d)    Illumination. Sources of light for illumination of the exterior of
buildings or grounds shall be shielded so as not to cause glare which would be
hazardous to auto drivers or would be objectionable to users of adjacent
property.

application of the provisions would result in a development which would not be
satisfactory for the district, the Commission may require adjustments in the
preliminary development plan, such as improvements to the design and
arrangement of buildings, yards, on-site circulation, control of access to
streets and such other features as fences and planting to further improve the
proposed development and to protect the surrounding developments.
      (4)    Upon approval of a preliminary development plan, the developer may
prepare a final development plan and submit it to the Planning and Zoning
Commission. If the proposed final development plan is found to comply with and
represents a detailed expansion of the preliminary development plan as
previously approved and complies with any conditions which may have been
imposed in the approval of the preliminary plan, and complies with all
applicable provisions of this chapter, the plan shall be approved within forty-
five days from the date of the meeting when all required plans and data were
received. Upon recommendation of the final development plan by the Commission
and the Architectural Review Board and approval by Council, the developer may
then apply for a building permit which shall be issued by the Building
Commissioner if the final development plan is found to comply with the Building
Code and other applicable regulations of the Municipality.
   (c)    Revision; Cancellation. The final development plan may be revised by
the developer and resubmitted through the same procedure required for the
original preliminary and final development plan. Failure to begin the
construction of all or a substantial portion of the improvements approved by
the final development plan within one year after the issuance of a permit shall
make null and void the plan as approved unless an extension of time is granted
by Council.

   (b)    General Yard Regulations.
      (1)    Front yards. Front yards shall be provided of a depth not less
than set forth above. The setbacks set forth above for uses abutting a major
street shall be measured to the right-of-way as shown on the latest street
plans under consideration, or accepted by the Municipality or the Ohio
Department of Transportation. The front yards for uses abutting a secondary
street shall be measured from the planned or existing street right-of-way line.
Front yards may be used for driveways and visitor parking, except that no
visitor parking shall be allowed in the required setbacks. However, any
accessory parking or service areas shall be physically separated from the
street by a curb and planting strip or other suitable barrier to prohibit
unchanneled motor vehicle access or egress, except onto accessways as
hereinafter set forth.
      (2)    Side and rear yards. A side and rear yard shall be provided
between the buildings or uses and the side lot lines. The yards shall be
measured from the building wall or open use to the nearest lot line. Where a
permitted main use occupies a lot which adjoins a side or rear yard of a
residential district line, yards shall be provided in accordance with the above
schedule of yard regulations. Where a permitted main use occupies a lot which
adjoins or is within a nonresidential district, the side or rear yards shall be
not less than set forth in the schedule unless required otherwise on an
approved development plan. Accessory off-street parking and loading areas shall
be permitted in a required side or rear yard. Outdoor storage of raw materials,
products, equipment and vehicles shall not be permitted unless a temporary
permit is granted by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (3)    Side and rear yards adjoining a residential district. The depth of
side and rear yards may be decreased when the more intensive use is adequately
screened from view of the residential use via combination of a six(6) foot
opaque board-on-board type fence or masonry wall and a continuous buffer strip,
consisting of a landscape bed measuring ten (10) feet in depth, with live plant
materials six feet in height at maturity planted no less than four (4) feet
apart on-center. Planting plan shall be subject to approval of the Planning and
Zoning Commission. Landscape materials shall be installed and continuously
maintained in a healthy and orderly state.
   (c)    Landscaping of Yards. Every required yard in which no off-street
parking or loading spaces are permitted, and any additional required landscaped
open areas as required in this Section shall be developed as lawn or planted
areas or maintained in an orderly natural state. The Commission may also
require additional fence, wall or hedge where a certain use adjoins a rear or
side yard of a residential district and such structure or hedge is determined
as being necessary to further buffer and protect such residential property.
   (d)    Illumination. Sources of light for illumination of the exterior of
buildings or grounds shall be shielded so as not to cause glare which would be
hazardous to auto drivers or would be objectionable to users of adjacent
property.

   1177.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the State of Ohio has delegated to municipal corporations
the responsibility to adopt a plan for dividing the municipal corporation or
any portion thereof into zones or districts in the interest of the public
health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare for the
limitation and regulation of the uses of buildings and other structures and of
premises in such zones or districts. Therefore, Council ordains this chapter.
(Ord. 76-23. Passed 12-20-76.)
   1177.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (a)    Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation. The flood hazard
areas of Mayfield Village are subject to periodic inundation which results in
loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce
and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (b)    General Causes of Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by:
      (1)    The cumulative effect of obstructions in flood plains, causing
increased flood heights and velocities;
      (2)    The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods
or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected
from flood damages.
   (c)    Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards. This chapter relies upon a
two-step process for reasonably analyzing the flood hazard affecting specific
lands. The Official Zoning Map adopted as part of this chapter by Section
1177.06 provides the first step by delineating a Regional Flood Plain District
determined to be subject to flooding, based upon evidence of past flood events
as shown on Flood Insurance Study and Flood Insurance Rate Map provided by
F.I.A. The following information has been used to delineate this district: soil
maps, historic flood maps, topographic studies and such other aids as the
Village Engineer shall determine.
   When specific information becomes available to designate separate Floodway
and Floodway Fringe Districts, this Regional Flood Plain District may be
separated into the two districts. In areas where this designation has not yet
been made the second step involves a determination of the flood hazard at the
site of any proposed special exception use. All uses, other than open space
uses, are special exception uses under the terms of Section
1177.13(b) and require a case by case evaluation by the Board of Appeals, with
expert technical assistance where necessary. The Board shall, where applicable:
      (1)    Estimate the discharge of the regional flood which is
representative of large floods known to have occurred in this region and which
are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the
particular streams subject to this chapter. It is in the general order of a
flood which could be expected to occur on the average once every 100 years.
      (2)    Determine the specific flooding threat at the site of the proposed
special exception use and determine whether the use is located in a floodway or
floodway fringe area by:
         A.    Calculation of water surface elevations and flood protection
elevations based upon hydraulic analysis of the capacity of the stream channel
and overbank areas to convey the regional flood. Flood protection elevations
shall be one foot above the water surface elevations of the regional flood.
         B.    Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood
without increasing flood heights to an extent which would cause substantial
upstream or downstream damage to existing or reasonably anticipated future
development. Computation of increases in flood heights caused by any
encroachment shall be based upon the reasonable assumption that there will be
an equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within that reach.
Generally, any increase in flood stages attributed to encroachments on the
flood plain of any river or stream shall not exceed 0.5 feet in any one reach
or for the cumulative effect of several reaches.
      (3)    Evaluate the effects of the proposed use upon the public health,
safety and general welfare in light of the purposes of this chapter and the
standards established herein and deny, grant or conditionally grant the
application for the proposed use.
         (Ord. 76-23. Passed 12-20-76.)
   1177.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize those losses described in Section
1177.02(a) by provisions designed to:
   (a)    Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities.
   (b)    Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
   (c)    Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended
purposes because of flood hazard.
      (Ord. 76-23. Passed 12-20-76.)
   1177.04 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   (a)    "Accessory use or structure" means a use or structure on the same lot
with, and of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, a principal
use or structure.
   (b)    "Board" means the Board of Appeals.
   (c)    "Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved
real estate including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling.
   (d)    "Equal degree of encroachment" means a standard applied in
determining the location of encroachment limits so that flood plain lands on
both sides of a stream are capable of conveying a proportionate share of
floodflows. This is determined by considering the effect of encroachment on the
hydraulic efficiency of the flood plain along both sides of a stream for a
significant reach.
   (e)    "Flood" means a temporary rise in stream level that results in
inundation of areas not ordinarily covered by water.
   (f)   "Floodway" means the channel of the watercourse and those portions of
the adjoining flood plains which are reasonably required to carry and discharge
the regional flood.
   (g)    "Floodway fringe" means that portion of the regional flood plain
located outside of the floodway.
   (h)    "Flood frequency" means the average frequency statistically
determined, for which it is expected that a specific flood level or discharge
may be equaled or exceeded.
   (i)    "Obstruction" means any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike,
pile, abutment, projection, excavation, channel, rectification, bridge,
conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure
or matter in, along, across or projecting into any channel, watercourse or
regional flood hazard area which may impede, retard or change the direction of
the flow of water, either in itself or by catching or collecting debris carried
by such water, or that is placed where the flow of water might carry the same
downstream to the damage of life or property.
   (j)    "Person" means any natural person, firm, partnership, association or
corporation, but does not include any governmental unit.
   (k)    "Reach" means a hydraulic engineering term to describe longitudinal
segments of a stream or river. A reach will generally include the segment of
the flood hazard area where flood heights are influenced by a man-made or
natural obstruction. In an urban area, the segment of a stream or river between
two consecutive bridge crossings would typically constitute a reach.
   (l)    "Regional flood" means a flood which is representative of large
floods known to have occurred generally in the area and reasonably
characteristic of what can be expected to occur on a particular stream. The
regional flood generally has a frequency approximately 100 years as is
determined by an analysis of floods in a particular stream and other streams in
the same general region.
   (m)    "Regional flood plain" means the area inundated by the regional flood
(100 year frequency flood). This is the flood plain area which shall be
regulated by the standards and criteria in this chapter.
   (n)    "Flood protection elevation" means the elevation to which uses
regulated by this chapter are required to be elevated or floodproofed.
   (o)    "Structure" means anything constructed or erected, on the ground or
attached to the ground, including but without limitation to buildings,
factories, sheds, cabins, mobile homes and other similar uses.
      (Ord. 76-23. Passed 12-20-76.)
   1177.05 LANDS TO WHICH CHAPTER APPLIES; ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOOD PROTECTION
ELEVATION.
   (a)    This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of
Mayfield Village shown on the Official Zoning Map as being located within the
boundaries of the Regional Flood Plain District.
   (b)    The flood protection elevation and necessary floodway areas shall be
established by the Board of Appeals as provided in Section
1177.20(b).
(Ord. 76-23. Passed 12-20-76.)
   1177.06 ADOPTION OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   The Official Zoning Map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and
attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of
this chapter. The Official Zoning Map will be on file in the office of the
Clerk of Council.
(Ord. 76-23. Passed 12-20-76.)
   1177.07 RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   The boundaries of the Regional Flood Plain District shall be determined by
scaling distances on the Official Zoning Map. Where interpretation is needed as
to the exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the
Official Zoning Map the Board of Appeals shall make the necessary
interpretation. The person contesting the location of the district boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the Board and to
submit his own technical evidence if he so desires.
(Ord. 76-23. Passed 12-20-76.)
   1177.08 COMPLIANCE.
   No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be
located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance
with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.
(Ord. 76-23. Passed 12-20-76.)
 
   1177.09 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter
imposes greater restrictions the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All
other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the
extent of the inconsistency only.
(Ord. 76-23. Passed 12-20-76.)
   1177.10 INTERPRETATION.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter
shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in
favor of Council, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other
powers granted by State statutes.
(Ord. 76-23. Passed 12-20-76.)
   1177.11 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by
man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by
debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside the Regulatory Flood
Plain District boundaries or land uses permitted within such district will be
free from flooding damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of Mayfield Village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 76-23. Passed 12-20-76.)
   1177.12 ESTABLISHMENT OF REGIONAL FLOOD PLAIN DISTRICT.
   The mapped flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of this chapter as the
same may be amended from time to time by the Federal Insurance Administration
are hereby designated as the Regional Flood Plain District. The boundaries of
this district shall be shown on the Official Zoning Map. Within this district
all uses not allowed as permitted uses or permissible as special exception uses
shall be prohibited.
(Ord. 76-23. Passed 12-20-76.)

floodway fringe areas. Therefore, the Board, as provided in Section
1177.02(c), shall determine whether the proposed special exception use is
located within a floodway or floodway fringe area. If it is determined that the
proposed use is located within the floodway, the provisions of Section
1177.14 shall apply. If it is determined that the proposed use is located
within the floodway fringe, the provisions of Section
1177.15 shall apply. All uses shall be subject to standards contained in this
chapter.
   (c)    Requirements Which Apply.
      (1)    The Building Commissioner shall keep records of all floor
elevations within the flood plain area. The Building Department shall keep
records of all elevations to which buildings in the flood plain have been
floodproofed.
      (2)    Certification for floodproofing of structures and improvements
within the flood plain shall be submitted to the Building Commissioner by a
registered engineer or architect. The Building Commissioner shall keep all
records of certifications.
      (3)    The developer shall obtain all State, Federal or County permits if
needed.
      (4)    Should a request for the alteration of a portion of a watercourse
be made the following is required:

including basement floor at least one foot above the regional elevations. The
fill shall extend at least fifteen feet beyond the limits of any structure or
building erected thereon. Where existing streets or utilities are at elevations
which make compliance with this provision impractical or in other special
circumstances, the Board of Appeals, may authorize other techniques for
elevation. Such structures shall be anchored to resist flotation or lateral
movement.
          B.    Structures other than residences shall also ordinarily be
elevated on fill as provided in Section
1177.15(b)(1) but may, in special circumstances, be protected as provided in
Section
1177.20(e) to a point at or above the flood protection elevation.

flow of floodwaters.
         A.    Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow, and
         B.    So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately
on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
      (4)    Structures shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation which may
result in damage to other structures, restriction of bridge openings and other
narrow sections of the stream or river.
      (5)    Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall
ordinarily be constructed at or above the flood protection elevation for the
particular area.
      (6)    Any new or improved water or sewer system shall be designed to

would substantially increase its flood damage potential shall be protected by
measures pursuant to Section
1177.20(e).
   (i)    The Building Commissioner shall prepare a list of those nonconforming
uses which have been floodproofed or otherwise adequately protected in
conformity with Section
1177.20(e). He shall present such list to the Board of Appeals which may issue
a certificate to the owner stating that such uses, as a result of these
corrective measures, are in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.

   1179.01 INTENT.
   It is the intent of Village Council to ensure the safe operation of oil and
gas wells and preserve the aesthetics and character of and within the Village.
Toward that end, this chapter has been adopted to supplement any State issued
permits which authorize the drilling of any oil and gas well within the
Village. The provisions of this chapter are based upon local conditions which
may not be known to the State at the time such drilling was authorized. It is
further the intent of the Village to exercise its local police authority,
authorized under Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, for the protection of the Village residents
and all emergency personnel who may be called upon to respond to an incident at
any oil and gas well. (Ord. 2009-56. Passed 12-21-09.)
   1179.02 INTERPRETATION.
   If any provision of this chapter is deemed to conflict with any
constitutional general law of the State of Ohio, the general law shall prevail.
In the event the general law of the State is silent as to any substantive
regulation contained herein, the substantive regulation established by this
chapter shall be applicable.
(Ord. 2009-56. Passed 12-21-09.)
   1179.03 PARTICIPATION IN PRE-PERMIT NOTIFICATION.
   The Village shall participate to the maximum extent practicable in the State
of Ohio’s pre- permit notification process on all drilling activities proposed
in the Village on private property. Specifically, the Village Building
Commissioner and Fire Chief shall:
   (a)   Attend pre-permit meetings and may request attendance by the Village
Engineer and other agencies at such meetings.
   (b)   Provide educational materials to interested residents.
      (Ord. 2009-56. Passed 12-21-09.)
   1179.04 MUNICIPAL REGULATIONS.
   Any person who has a permit to drill for oil and gas within Mayfield
Village, which has been issued by any Department of the State of Ohio (“Permit
Holder”), and the Landowner(s) of the land upon which the actual well will be
drilled and who has leased their land for such purposes (“Surface Owner”),
shall adhere to the following regulations:
   (a)   A copy of the state issued permit shall be filed with the Village
Building Commissioner by the Surface Owner or Permit Holder no later than four
weeks before the commencement of any operations preparatory to drilling in the
Village. Upon receipt by the Building Commissioner, a copy of such permit shall
be delivered by the Surface Owner or Permit Holder to all owners and/or
occupants of all properties which are adjacent to and/or adjoin the unit where
a well is to be drilled with proof of the date of such delivery furnished to
the Building Commissioner by the Surface Owner or Permit Holder not less than
fourteen business days before commencement of any operations preparatory to
drilling in the Village. The Surface Owner or Permit Holder shall check with
the Building Commissioner prior to delivery to these adjacent and/or adjoining
property owners and occupants to obtain information as to the identity of the
individuals to receive the notice and copy of the permit. “Unit”as used in this
section shall mean those properties that are identified on the state issued
permit as being part of the acreage necessary to drill a gas and oil well. A
typical unit comprises twenty acres.
   (b)   Along with a copy of the state issued permit, a letter shall be filed
with the Building Commissioner by the Surface Owner or Permit Holder which
identifies all the property owner(s) and occupants of the unit where the well
is to be drilled; by name and address, identifying all persons, including but
not limited to the Permit Holder, and anyone else who will be responsible for
the drilling and operation of the well. The identification shall include, at a
minimum, names, address and work telephone numbers that are valid twenty-four
hours a day. Any contractors performing gas or oil well drilling work shall
comply with the parameters of Chapters
1309 and
1313 including, but not limited to:
      (1)   Being registered with the Village; and
      (2)   Obtaining a drilling permit from the Village in the amount of five
hundred dollars ($500.00).
   (c)   Plans for all wells, tank batteries, including tank dimensions and gas
meter types; excavation work (including but not limited to boring pits) and all
other site work including final landscaping plans, confirmation of the tracking
methods that will be used in drilling and identification of any required tie
ins into any existing gas line or lines and/or the construction of any new gas
lines, along with material safety data sheets for all materials to be used in
the drilling process shall be presented to the Building Commissioner and the
Village Engineer not less than four weeks prior to the commencement of any
drilling or other operations. These plans shall show the topography of the site
and of all vehicular access to and from the site, from any road or street. Up
to two weeks shall be allowed by the Village for the review and approval of
plans.
   (d)   Plans showing all buildings on the subject premises, and all buildings
within five hundred feet of the well and tank sites, shall be provided.
Incomplete or illegible plans will be returned and the two week review process
will be restarted once all data is available.
   (e)   No well may be drilled, or tank batteries located, in any location
where emergency vehicles (e.g. fire trucks and ambulances) cannot obtain
reasonable access to the site.
   (f)   Proof of insurance shall be filed with the Building Commissioner and
Law Director, prior to the commencement of drilling. The proof of insurance
must establish that the Surface Owner and Permit Holder are insured by a
solvent insurer, licensed to do business in the State of Ohio, with limits of
five million dollars ($5,000,000) per occurrence for personal injury and
property damage. The Village shall be named as an additional insured on the
policy. The amount of such insurance shall be reviewed by the Building
Commissioner every five years and may be adjusted based on inflationary
increases. The Village shall be named as an additional insured on the policy.
   (g)   Emergency contact information for all persons engaged in drilling and
operating the well shall be filed with the Building Commissioner and Fire
Chief, prior to the commencement of drilling. Such information shall be
immediately updated upon any change of circumstance(s).
   (h)   Drilling operations and site preparation and restoration work shall
comply with Chapter
1129 Erosion and Sediment Control.
   (i)   Within thirty days after drilling operations have been completed, the
Permit Holder shall do all of the following:
      (1)   Remove all bore pits, and all well spoils from the subject
property;
      (2)   Fill all bore pits with clean fill dirt, and restore the grade of
the site to its previous elevation;
      (3)   Seed all disturbed sites with grass or other vegetative ground
cover and ensure such ground cover becomes established; and
      (4)   Notify the Building Commissioner and Village Engineer that the site
has been restored pursuant to the terms of subsection (h) and this subsection
(i). The Building Commissioner, Village Engineer and any other professional
needed by the Village, shall inspect the site within fourteen days of the
notification.
   (j)   At all times relative to the drilling, operation and capping of the
well, the well and all tank facilities shall be secured from public access by
sufficient fencing and/or vegetation. The sufficiency of the fencing and
vegetation shall be determined by the Building Commissioner. Representatives of
the Village shall have access to all affected areas during the course of
construction and installation, for the purpose of inspection and monitoring
purposes. In addition, the Surface Owner or Permit Holder shall do the
following:
      (1)   The Permit Holder or Surface Owner of any parcel upon which an oil
or gas well will be located shall be responsible for installation and
maintenance of screening and buffering as set forth in this section.
      (2)   At least fourteen days prior to commencing any oil or gas well
drilling operations within the Village and without regard to whether such
operation is being performed pursuant to a permit issued under Ohio R.C.
1509.06, the Permit Holder or Surface Owner shall submit to the Building
Commissioner a line-of-site plan of sufficient quality and detail as will truly
and accurately depict the actual appearance of the well, including storage
facilities and all other equipment appurtenant thereto, from the following
locations:
         A.   All adjacent public rights-of-way; and
         B.   All adjacent parcels not also owned by the Surface Owner or, if
owned by the Surface Owner, not used in a common manner and/or as part of a
common site development.
The line-of-site plans shall take into consideration the length of any public
rights-of-way or property lines abutting the parcel where the well is to be
located and, when the distances involved are significant enough to warrant
multiple line-of-site renderings along any such lines, the Building
Commissioner may in his sole discretion request from the Surface Owner or
Permit Holder such additional plans. In the sole discretion of the Building
Commissioner, if a topographical map will suffice for purposes of this section,
the Building Commissioner may waive the requirement for line-of-sight plans and
utilize the topographical map.
      (3)   The well, including storage facilities and all other equipment
appurtenant thereto, shall be fully screened at eye-level view from the
locations set forth in subsections (j)(2)A. and B. as follows:
         A.   The built and natural environments in the area, as well as the
topography, shall be taken into account to ensure full screening at eye-level
view.
         B.   Preference in all cases shall be for the sole use of live
vegetative growth of species native to the Northeastern Ohio region, or which,
once established, will not require further maintenance to sustain them. Species
which mature quickly and whose average live spans correlate with the
anticipated operational life of the well should be utilized whenever possible.
The minimum size of vegetation at initial planting shall be specified.
         C.   When, owing to any peculiar site conditions present, it is
necessary to use non-vegetative means to accomplish full screening, preference
shall be given to the use of natural materials to accomplish the screening,
although earthen mounding is to be avoided whenever possible. In such
instances, live vegetative growth shall be used in conjunction with such other
means to the fullest extent possible.
         D.   In all cases, the preference shall be to place the screening as
near to the well site as possible. The precise location of screening shall be
determined on a case-by-case basis to maximize the screening and minimize cost
to the Surface Owner where practicable.
         E.   Where an adjacent parcel is not developed nor in the process of
being developed, the Surface Owner or Permit Holder may elect to delay the
installation of any screening until such development occurs.
   (k)   At all times relative to the drilling, operation and capping
activities of the well, roads and rights-of-way shall be kept clean of all mud,
gravel, silt or other related debris. Road cleaning shall be performed as
needed to meet this requirement, which may include, but not be limited to:
scraping, shoveling, sweeping, or washing. Traffic control shall be
administered at the Permit Holder’s expense, if necessary.
   (l)   In accordance with subsections (i) and (j) hereof, within thirty days
after the drilling operations have been completed, the Surface Owner or Permit
Holder shall plant sufficient vegetation which, in conjunction with any fencing
and natural vegetation, shall effectively and permanently screen all above-
ground facilities from all neighbors and from all public and private rights-of-
way while such facilities are on the subject premises. Damaged or disturbed
pre-existing plantings shall be restored to match the existing surrounding. If
drilling operations are completed during winter months not conducive to
planting, the Building Commissioner shall establish a date in the future when
required plantings shall be completed, not to exceed 180 days. The Building
Commissioner, Village Engineer and any other professional needed by the Village
shall determine the sufficiency of the screening and vegetation and may order
the Surface Owner or Permit Holder to install additional screening or plant
more vegetation.
   (m)   The Permit Holder shall give the Fire Chief and Building Commissioner
at least forty-eight hours notice before commencing to drill. The Permit Holder
shall also submit a drilling report to the Village at least biweekly from the
date preparatory drilling operations begin until the well is fully drilled and
operations. The drilling report shall be in a form similar to that attached as
Appendix 1.
   (n)   A cash deposit of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) per well, shall be
filed with the Building Commissioner by the Permit Holder or Surface Owner to
ensure sufficient securing and screening of facilities, as provided herein, and
to ensure the removal of all equipment and the restoration of the site after
the well is drilled. The Village shall return the cash deposit upon the
restoration of the site after the well has been drilled and all equipment has
been removed. The cash deposit shall also be used to ensure payment of any fees
which will be incurred by the Village Engineer or any other professional the
Village determines it must engage in order to ensure compliance with the code.
Upon completion of all involvement by the Village Engineer (or other
professional), the Village shall return any funds which remain on deposit.
   (o)   It shall be a violation of this section for a Surface Owner or Permit
Holder to violate the terms and conditions of any state issued permit.
   (p)   The Building Commissioner or his designee shall, within fourteen
business days of receipt of the plans, pursuant to subsection (c) hereof,
review said plans and immediately advise the Surface Owner or Permit Holder if
anything shown on the plans does not comply with the regulations set forth
herein. In the event that any Surface Owner or Permit Holder fails to comply
with the regulations herein promulgated, the administrative official
responsible for the enforcement hereof (i.e. the Building Commissioner or Fire
Chief, as designated), shall provide written notice to the Surface Owner and
the Permit Holder within forty-eight hours of the failure to comply. Such
service shall be made to the addresses identified in subsection (b) hereof, and
if no address has been provided, to any address identified on the permit issued
by the State. The notice shall advise the Surface Owner and the Permit Holder
that if they wish to appeal the decision of the administrative official, the
time for appeal is five days after service of the notice. Incomplete or
illegible plan submissions shall cause the time limit for review to be extended
by fourteen days from the time all correct data is submitted to the Village.
   (q)   The Surface Owner or Permit Holder shall be required to comply with
Section
 905.011 relating to Heavy Equipment.
      (Ord. 2009-56. Passed 12-21-09.)
   1179.05 APPEAL.
   The determination of any administrative official, in applying the
regulations promulgated hereunder, which is adverse to the rights of any
Surface Owner or any Permit Holder may be appealed to the Village Board of
Zoning Appeals by filing a notice of appeal with the Building Commissioner
within five days of notification by the administrative official that the Permit
Holder or Surface Owner has not complied with the regulation. The appeal shall
be heard at the next Board of Zoning Appeals meeting, but such further hearings
may be held as required for the Board to resolve the appeal. Decisions of the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall be appealable to Village Council by any
interested person or entity.
(Ord. 2009-56. Passed 12-21-09.)
   1179.99 PENALTY.

(Ord. 93-32. Approved by voters l 1-2-93.)
   1181.07 YARDS.
   (a)    Side Yards in Residence Districts. In a Class U-1, U-2 or U-
3 District, for every building erected there shall be a side yard along each
lot line other than a front line or rear line. Each single-family dwelling,
each two-family dwelling and each apartment house shall be deemed a separate
building and shall have side yards as above prescribed except that two single-
family dwellings may be attached as a double house and be considered a single
building in any area other than an area within a portion of a Class U-
1 District that is within a Class A-1 District.
   In a Class U-1 District, the least dimension of the side yard shall not be
less than ten feet and at least thirty-five percent of the average width of the
lot at the building line occupied by the main building shall be devoted to side
yards.
   For a hotel or motel in a U-3 District, the least dimension of each side
yard shall be not less than twelve percent of the average width of the lot, but
such least dimension need not exceed twelve feet, provided such least dimension
shall in no case be less than one-sixth of the height of the building, nor less
than six feet. The requirements for side yards for apartment buildings shall be
as prescribed in subsection (b) hereof as follows:
(Ord. 93-32. Approved by voters 11-2-93.)
   (b)    Yards for Apartment Development. Apartment buildings shall be planned
and arranged in a relationship to each other and to the surrounding lot line so
as to provide privacy, light and view for each suite and so as to form a
coordinated arrangement of buildings and open space. In order to review and
evaluate the site plans, preliminary and final site development plans for every
proposed apartment house project shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning
Commission by the developer as required in Section
1173.10.
   For all yards, the space between any two apartment buildings and the
distances between any building and the side or rear lines of the lot shall vary
according to the length and height of the buildings. The minimum distance
between any two buildings, designated as buildings A and B. their length as L
and their height as H. shall be as determined by the formula:
 
Minimum distance=    LA + LB + HA + HB
            3.5
   The minimum distance between a side or rear lot line and any building
designated as A, shall be as determined by the formula:
 
Minimum distance=    LA + HA
             3.5
   The length of a building, for the purposes of these formulae shall be
construed as the length of the portion of building A from which lines drawn
perpendicular to the face of such wall, or walls, will intersect any wall of
opposite building B or intersect the lot line in the case of a yard along side
or rear lot line. In cases where lines drawn perpendicular from the face of any
wall of one building will not intersect the face of any wall of another
building, where diagonal but not opposite, the minimum horizontal distance
between such buildings shall be not less than one-half the combined height of
the two buildings. Informal and oblique arrangements of buildings, conformance
to topography and coordinating the site pattern with natural features is
encouraged. The application of the above formulae for spacing of buildings,
especially informal and oblique arrangements, shall be determined by the
Planning and Zoning Commission in the review of the preliminary site
development plan.
   The minimum distances from any apartment house to parking areas, driveways,
walks and recreation areas and to the lot line, as set forth herein are to be
applied in the site planning.

       *Except at building entrances.
(Ord. 77-42. Approved by voters l 1-7-78.)
   (c)    Rear Yards in Residential Districts.
      (l)    In a Class U-l or U-2 District, every building erected shall have
a rear yard. The least dimension of such rear yard shall be twenty percent
(20%) of the depth of the lot, but such least dimension need not be more than
forty feet, provided such least dimension shall in no case be less than the
height of the building. On a corner lot where the rear line is identical with
the side line of the interior lot, no accessory building, if detached from the
main building, shall be erected within twenty-five feet of any street line or
within ten feet of the rear lot line.
         (Ord. 88-28. Approved by voters 5-2-89.)
      (2)    (EDITOR’S NOTE: Former subsection (c)(2) was repealed by Ordinance
2023-05, passed May 15, 2023. See Section
 1157.06 for relevant provisions.)
      (3)    No accessory building referred to in this section shall exceed
fifteen feet in height.
         (Ord. 94-20. Approved by electors 11-8-94.)
   (d)    Side and Rear Yard Exceptions.
      (1)    The area required in a side or rear yard shall be open from the
established grade, or from the natural grade if higher than the established
grade, to the sky, unobstructed except for the ordinary projections of window
sills, belt courses, cornices and other ornamental features to the extent of
not more than four inches, except that within five feet of the street wall, a
cornice may project not over three feet into such yard, and provided that if
the building is not over two and one-half stories in height, the cornice may
project not more than two and one-half feet into such yard.
      (2)    A corner of a yard may be cut off between the walls of the same
building provided that the length of the wall of such cut-off does not exceed
seven feet.
      (3)    A building and any accessory building erected on the same lot
shall, for the purpose of side and rear requirements, be considered as a single
building.
   (e)    Front Yards; Building Lines. For the purpose of regulating front
yards, for the purpose of further regulating side yards or corner buildings and
for the purpose of regulating the alignment of buildings near street frontages,
building lines as set forth on the revised district and zone map, prepared by
the F. A. Pease Engineering Co., and duly approved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and by Council and dated July 19, 1948, which is hereby declared to
be a part hereof, are hereby established. The map designations and the map
designation rules which accompany the map are hereby declared part thereof.
 
   Between a building line and the street line no building or portion of a
building extending above the established grade may be erected. In a Class U-
1 or U-2 District a one-story unenclosed porch may, however, be constructed
between the building line and the street line. On a corner lot between the
building line and the street line and within the triangular space included
between the street lines for a distance of twenty-five feet from their point of
intersection, no fence or other structure more than three feet in height above
the plane of the established grade shall hereafter be erected, and no shrubs or
foliage shall be maintained that in the judgment of the Building Commissioner
will materially obstruct the view by a driver of a vehicle approaching the
intersection and within seventy-five feet of the center of such intersection or
approaching cross traffic within seventy-five feet of the center of such
intersection. Where a building line is shown on the building map as an existing
alignment line, the alignment of the building existing along such frontage
shall determine the building line. On any street frontage in a Class U-1 or U-
2 District, where no building line is designated on the building line map the
location of the building line shall be as follows:
      (1)    On a street frontage on either side of a street between two
intersecting streets, but excluding the frontage along the side line of a
corner lot, the distance of the building line back from the street line shall
be twenty percent of the average or normal depth of the lots having their front
lines along such street frontage, but such distance back from the street line
need not be more than forty feet. Where in any portion of such street frontage
there are lots of markedly less depth than the normal, the Planning and Zoning
Commission in defining and applying this building line regulation may, when in
its opinion the general purpose and intent of this section will be better
served thereby, divide such street frontage into sections for the application
of the above twenty percent building line requirement. For the purpose of this
paragraph the term "lot" shall include unimproved parcels in separate ownership
and unimproved lots or parcels in subdivisions of land.
      (2)    In a Class U-1 District, along the side line of a corner lot, the
distance of the building line back from the street line shall be twenty percent
of the average width of such lot, but such distance back from the street line
need not be more than twenty feet.
      (3)    The revised district and zone map approved, adopted and made a
part of this Zoning Code is amended so that the building line as defined in
this subsection (e) as the same appears on the revised district and zone map
with respect to both sides of S. O. M. Center Road, Wilson Mills Road, Highland
Road, White Road, Lander Road and Ridgebury Road shall be sixty feet back from
the street line of each of the streets. As to the streets, the setback
provision in this paragraph (3) shall apply, rather than the setback provisions
found in paragraphs (1) and (2) hereof.

   1183.01 PURPOSES.
   Off-street parking and loading requirements and regulations are established
in order to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
   (a)   To relieve congestion on streets, so that they can be utilized more
fully for movement of traffic; and
   (b)   To promote the safety and convenience of employees, guests and
shoppers by locating parking areas so as to lessen motor vehicle movements in
areas of congestion; and
   (c)   To promote the general convenience, welfare and prosperity of
institutional, residential, retail business and industrial developments, which
depend upon off-street parking and off-street loading facilities.
      (Ord. 2010-41. Passed 1-18-11.)
   1183.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of determining accessory off-street parking requirements,
definitions and standards shall be as follows:
   (a)   "Accessory parking space" means an open or enclosed area accessible
from a street for parking of motor vehicles of owners, occupants, employees,
customers or tenants of the main building or use. Except for one and two-family
dwellings, each space shall have a maximum square foot area of no more than 180
square feet or nine feet wide and twenty feet in length exclusive of access
drives and aisles. The number of spaces shall be determined from an accurate
plan of the area. In the event that the main building is used by one corporate
entity, employing in excess of 1500 people at such site, then such space shall
not be less than nine feet wide and 180 square feet in area.
   (b)   "Gross floor area"means the total area of all the floors in a building
measured from the exterior faces of the building.
   (c)   "Seat" means the unit capacity of a building to accommodate people,
and in a building including group assembly, such as a church or auditorium, the
unit of measurement shall be seven square feet for the portion of the building
utilized for seating accommodation.
   (d)   "Employees" means a unit of measurement representing the optimum
employment capacity of a business or other use at one time or shift.
   (e)   "Required minimum parking spaces" as computed, means where the
computation results in a fractional unit, one additional off-street parking
space shall be provided.
      (Ord. 2010-41. Passed 1-18-11.)
   1183.03 OFF-STREET PARKING FACILITIES; WHEN REQUIRED.
   Accessory off-street parking facilities, including access driveways, shall
be determined in conformance with the schedule, Section 1183.05, for the
various institutional, residential, business, office-laboratory and production-
distribution buildings and uses, and provided in conformance with the other
provisions of this chapter as a condition precedent to the occupancy and
maintenance of such building or use. Facilities shall be provided for the
entire building or use and shall be located on the same lot as the main
building or use served:
   (a)   Whenever a building is constructed or a new use established.
   (b)   Whenever the use of an existing building is changed to a use requiring
more parking facilities.
   (c)   Whenever an existing building is altered and there is an increase in
the number of dwelling units, seating capacity, type of service or operation or
floor areas of building. (Ord. 2010-41. Passed 1-18-11.)
   1183.04 CONTINUATION OF PARKING FACILITIES.
   (a)   All off-street parking facilities, or those required as necessary to a
use of a proposed or altered building, shall continue unobstructed in
operation, shall not be used for motor vehicle service or repair and shall not
be reduced below the required size as long as the main use remains.
   (b)   In order to insure the continued use for motor vehicle parking
purposes of any areas established therefore, the Planning and Zoning Commission
may require before approval of same, evidence in writing that the owner or
owners of the land to be included in such motor vehicle parking areas have by
covenant agreed to continue the use of such land for off-street parking
accessory to the residential, institutions, business or industrial use for
which such parking areas are required, such covenant to be filed among the
records of Cuyahoga County.

(Ord. 2010-41. Passed 1-18-11.)
   1183.06 LAND BANKING OF REQUIRED PARKING.
   (a)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall determine the number of
parking spaces to be constructed, as may be appropriate, based on the evidence
submitted. Reduction in the number of parking spaces to actually be constructed
may be authorized by the Planning and Zoning Commission when the applicant
shows that the required number of parking spaces set forth in Section
1183.05 is substantially in excess of the parking needed to reasonably serve
the employees, patrons, and other persons frequenting the subject property.
   (b)   The site plan shall indicate how the additional number of spaces
otherwise required could subsequently be provided on the site, and in all
cases, with review and approval by the Village Engineer, the storm water
management systems must be designed and constructed to accommodate all land
banked spaces as detailed in Chapter
1128 Comprehensive Storm Water Management.
      (1)   The additional parking area shall be designed to comply with all
required yards, setbacks, and driveways for subject property and shall meet all
requirements of this Code. The additional parking areas design may be a surface
lot or parking garage, as determined in the site plan.
      (2)   Landscaping of the land banked area must be in full compliance of
the zoning regulations and at a minimum, vegetation approved by the Planning
and Zoning Commission, shall substantially cover the land banked area. The
Planning and Zoning Commission may require additional landscaping of the land
banked area.
   (c)   The land banked area shall not be used for any other purpose and must
be part of the same zoning lot and all under the same ownership.
   (d)   The Planning and Zoning Commission on the basis of increased parking
demand, may require the conversion of all or part of the land banked area to
off-street parking spaces.
   (e)   The reservation of said spaces and the purpose therefore, shall be
shown upon the approved plans as "Land Banked Future Parking" and shall be a
component of any future submittal involving the subject property. (Ord.2010-41.
Passed 1-18-11.)
   1183.07 SEPARATE OR COMBINED USE OF FACILITIES. 
   (a)   A building containing one use shall provide the off-street parking
spaces as required for the specific use. A building or group of buildings
containing two or more uses, operating normally during the same hours, and
which have different off-street parking requirements shall provide spaces for
not less than the sum of the spaces required for each use.
   (b)   Institutions and businesses, as set forth in the Schedule of Section
1183.05, may assume that up to, but not more than fifty percent of their
requirements may be shared in adjacent parking areas which are accessory to
institution or business establishments and which normally have different hours
of operation. Provided, however, where there is a sharing of facilities by
different owners, there shall be a contract covering a period of time as may be
required by the Planning and Zoning Commission and provided further, that
should any of the uses be changed or the facilities discontinued, then the
required spaces for the use remaining shall be provided elsewhere as a
condition precedent to the continued use of such building or buildings. The
applicant must then provide written notification of the change to the Planning
and Zoning Commission within 60 days of change, providing a remedy satisfactory
to the Planning and Zoning Commission to ensure adequate parking.
   (c)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may require the applicant to
provide a parking study with information deemed necessary to its review of a
shared parking arrangement. This information includes but is not limited to:
      (1)   The type and hours of operation and parking demand, for each land
use.
      (2)   A site plan displaying shared use spaces in the lot and walking
distance to the uses sharing the lot.
      (3)   A description of the character of land use and parking patterns of
adjacent land uses.
      (4)   An estimate of anticipated turnover in parking space use over the
course of 12 to 24 hours at the site.
      (5)   Consideration of snow removal activities and snow storage capacity
in lot.
   (d)   Parking spaces to be shared must not be reserved for individuals or
groups on a 24-hour basis.
   (e)   Users sharing a parking facility shall provide for safe, convenient
walking between land uses and parking, including safe, well-marked pedestrian
crossings, signage and adequate lighting. (Ord.2010-41. Passed 1-18-11.)
   1183.08 ACCESS DRIVES TO PARKING AREAS.
   (a)    The location and width of entrance and exit driveways to parking
facilities and "drive-in" businesses, shall be planned to interfere as little
as possible with the use of nearby property and with pedestrian and vehicular
traffic on the nearest streets and the streets to which they connect. Access to
the streets shall be controlled in the interest of public safety and to
maintain the designed capacity of the street system and to control access along
State arterial highways adjacent to freeway interchanges. Therefore, the
centerline of the access driveways on the frontage street shall be at least 100
feet from the right-of-way line of the nearest intersecting street and spaced
at not less than 180 feet intervals measured from the center line of the
driveways, provided, however, that driveways to serve gasoline service stations
shall be in accord with "Regulations Governing Ingress and Egress at Gasoline
Service Stations Fronting on Highways" Ohio Department of Highways, February 1,
1955, or amendments thereto. At least two separate driveways shall be provided,
and whenever possible they shall be limited to either entrance or exit if
deemed necessary by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (b)    Entrances and exits shall be limited to two lanes and shall be so
designed so that all vehicles can be driven forward into the street. The width
of such entrances and exits shall conform to the following schedule:
 
      Width Measured in Feet
Lanes Minimum Maximum
1     10      12
2     20      24
3     30      36
 
      (1)   Joint use driveways: A system of joint use driveways and cross
access easements shall be established and used to the maximum extent
practicable as determined by the Village. The system of joint use driveways
shall incorporate the following:
         A.   Stub-outs and other design features to make it visually obvious
that the abutting properties may be tied in to provide cross-access via a
service drive.
         B.   A unified access and circulation plan for coordinated or shared
parking areas.
         C.   An easement with the deed recorded by all participating property
owners allowing cross access to and from other properties served by the joint
use driveways.
   (c)    In all cases the radius of the edge of the apron shall be at least
twenty feet so that a motor vehicle may enter or leave the curb lane without
obstructing vehicles in other traffic lanes. The maximum curb cut shall be
limited to the width of the entrance or exit plus the radius of the apron.
   (d)    For "drive-in" facilities such as, but not confined to auto washes,
food service or pick-up and bank teller windows, adequate drives in addition to
that specified herein shall be provided on the property for the lining up of
motor vehicles awaiting the occupants turn. Such lines shall not be permitted
to form on public ways.
   (e)    No entrance or exit driveway shall be constructed or maintained so as
to lead to or from a local residential street abutting a local business
district. The words "local residential street" mean a street used primarily for
access to abutting residential properties. The angle of intersection between
the driveway and the street shall be between seventy degrees and ninety
degrees.
   (f)    The developments abutting Wilson Mills Road for a distance of 1200
feet from the nearest intersection of a freeway ramp shall be planned so that
the first access street or driveway onto Wilson Mills shall be not less than
600 feet from the outermost ramp terminal right of way and the successive
access point shall be spaced at intervals not less than 600 feet on center.
These objectives may be accomplished by marginal service roads, parallel
service roads, combining the access of several developments or their approved
facilities. Whenever it is not feasible to provide such facilities at the time
of the original development, the Commission may grant temporary access for use
at lesser distances for a limited period of time, provided the developments and
future control facilities are planned so as not to cause any substantial extra
costs to the public or cause relocations or structures when the permanent
facilities are constructed.
   (g)    To carry out the above purposes and objectives on sections of Wilson
Mills Road or other major streets within the area of influence but more than
1200 feet from the interchange, the Commission may permit the spacing of
accessways at lesser intervals but not less than 200 feet on center, if the
projected volume of traffic warrants more frequent spacing.
(Ord. 2010-41. Passed 1-18-11.)
   1183.09 OFF-STREET LOADING FACILITIES.
   Loading and/or unloading facilities shall be provided for all business,
service, commercial and industrial buildings hereafter erected or altered for
such uses. The facilities shall be maintained as long as such building is
occupied, shall continue unobstructed and not be used for repair or servicing
of motor vehicles. Space required and allocated for off-street parking shall
not be allocated or used to satisfy the space requirements for off-street
loading.
   (a)    Space Required. A required off-street loading space shall be at least
twelve feet wide by at least twenty-five feet in length for buildings less than
15,000 square feet of gross floor area, and each required loading space for a
building of 15,000 square feet or more of floor area shall be not less than
fourteen feet wide by sixty feet in length. Each space shall have a vertical
clearance of at least fourteen feet. The above areas shall be exclusive of
aisle and maneuvering space. For manufacturing and service uses the maneuvering
space or apron for off-street loading shall be at least sixty feet wide
measured from the outermost part of any vehicle backed up to a loading dock or
any other possible obstruction in the maneuvering area.
Uses which otherwise require off-street loading facilities but are located for
buildings of less than 5,000 square feet of floor area shall be provided with a
receiving platform or other facilities adjacent to a service drive or other
open space on the same lot.
   (b)    Location and Design. Loading facilities shall not be located in a
front yard or in a required side or rear yard. Off-street loading spaces shall
be provided with surface improvements as required for parking areas. Each
required off-street loading space shall be designed for direct vehicular access
by means of a driveway or driveways to a public street in a manner which will
least interfere with traffic movements and lane encroachment. The access shall
be located so that the driveway center line shall be not less than 100 feet
from the nearest intersecting street line.
   (c)    Schedule of Requirements. Loading spaces shall be provided in

private or public property.
   (c)    Portland cement concrete at least six (6) inches above the levels of
the surface of the parking area and at least twelve (12) inches below the
surface shall be provided to define the limits of the parking area except at
exits and entrances. Such curbs shall be at least six inches thick. The
following design parameters apply to curb installation:
      (1)    Curbs shall be arranged so that no part of a parked vehicle shall
project into that portion of a required yard in which off-street parking is
prohibited.
      (2)    Curbs separating landscaped areas from parking areas shall allow
storm water runoff to pass through them where appropriate and approved by the
Village Engineer. Curbs may be:
         A.    Perforated with gaps or breaks,
         B.    When applicable, removed from the perimeter of paved areas, or
installed flush with the pavement surface to allowing sheet flow from storm
water runoff into bioretention cells or filter strips. Wheel stops may be
required in place of curbs or where a flush curb is used.
   (d)    Planted islands shall be developed and distributed so as to interrupt
the expanse of paved area. Such islands shall have a minimum dimension of ten
(10) feet.

   1185.01 PURPOSE.
    (a)    Signs obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses
for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. In
addition to causing distractions and obstructions that may contribute to
traffic and pedestrian accidents, signs are as much subject to control as
noise, odors, debris and like characteristics of a use that, if not controlled
and regulated, may become a nuisance to adjacent properties or the community in
general.
 
   (b)    The purpose of this article is to regulate the size, color,
illumination, movement, materials, location, height, and condition of all signs
for exterior observation for the following reasons:
       (1)    Preserve the noncommercial character of residential
neighborhoods, and to provide reasonable, yet appropriate, conditions for
identifying businesses and services rendered in commercial districts;
      (2)    Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards by regulating signs,
including signs with lights and/or motion;
      (3)    Promote expeditious and safe navigation and wayfinding for
pedestrian and vehicular traffic through legible and appropriate signs;
      (4)    Preserve order, attractiveness, and cleanliness, maintain open
spaces, avoid the appearance of clutter, and prevent nuisances and invitations
to vandalism;
      (5)    Require that signs are constructed and maintained in a
structurally sound and attractive condition;
      (6)    Maintain property values and ensure compatibility with surrounding
landscape and architecture including, but not limited to, areas of historical
significance;
      (7)    Encourage aesthetic quality in the design, location, and size of
all signs;
      (8)    Protect the public peace, general health, safety and welfare,
convenience, and comfort, and to protect and encourage a more attractive
economic, business, and overall physical appearance of the community.
 
   (c)    This article must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the
First Amendment guarantee of free speech. If any provision of this article is
found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such finding shall
not affect the validity of other provisions of this article which can be given
effect without the invalid provision.

which the sign is accessory.
   (a)    The gross area of signs for a building or use shall include all
permanent surfaces visible from a public way, including, but not limited to,
the area of permanent window and door signs.
   (b)    Whenever the gross area of signs is related to the size of the
building or lot: the frontage of a building shall be the width in lineal feet
of the facade of the building, business, office or industrial unit which faces
the principal street, or the facade containing the main entrance of a business,
office, or industrial building. The frontage of a lot not occupied by a

         A.    No wooden blocks or anchorage with wood used in connection with
screws, nails, spikes or staples shall be considered proper anchorage.
                  B.    Wall signs attached to wood walls may be supported by
lag screws of not less than one-fourth inch in diameter, but shall be of size
and length to support load involved.
      (e)    Structural Design. Any graphic, sign structure, or canopy as
defined in this chapter, shall be designed and constructed to withstand a wind
pressure of not less than thirty pounds per square foot of net surface area,
allowing for wind from any direction, and shall be constructed to withstand
loads as required in the Building Code. Signs shall not extend above parapets.
The construction, bracing, anchorage and support of permanent signs shall be in
accordance with the requirements of the Building Code of the Municipality and
of this chapter.
   (f)    Relation to Traffic Devices. Signs shall not be erected so as to

   1309.06 DEPOSIT FOR DAMAGE TO PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   Whoever obtains a permit to construct a new building shall, at the time of
issuance thereof, deposit with the Building Commissioner the sum of five
hundred dollars ($500.00) in case of a single or two-family dwelling house, or
a commercial or industrial building, and twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per
dwelling unit, but not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) per building,
in the case of an apartment building of any kind, which shall be paid into the
Treasury of the Municipality. The amount of the cash deposit shall be returned
by the Finance Director to the permit holder when the building has been
approved on final inspection. However, if in the process of such construction
any damage has been done by the permit holder or any of his contractors,
subcontractors, agents or employees or others under his control, to the public
highways or other public property or the property of other persons, the amount
of such damage as calculated by the Commissioner, together with any unpaid
permit or inspection fees, shall be deducted from the amount of the deposit to
be returned. If, in the course of such construction, mud, dirt, waste
materials, rubbish or other debris is deposited on any dedicated or undedicated
street or other public property and is not removed therefrom, within two hours
after written notice to remove the same has been given by the Police Department
to the permit holder, or his contractor, subcontractor, agent or employee, then
the Municipality may cause such substances to be removed and the cost of such
removal shall be deducted from the cash deposit. If during the course of
construction the deductions made by the Municipality from the cash deposit by
reason of repairing any damage or removal of any substance bring the amount of
cash on deposit to less than five hundred dollars ($500.00), then the
Commissioner may demand that the permit holder replenish the deficiency in the
amount of the cash deposit so that it shall again be in the amount of five
hundred dollars ($500.00); or on failure of the permit holder to replenish the
funds within two days after such demand in writing by the Commissioner, the
latter may revoke the permit or may stop construction until such time as the
permit holder has complied with the demand. Whoever fails to comply with such
demand within two days after it is made, shall be fined as provided in Section
1301.99.
   1309.061 LANDSCAPE CONTRACTORS DEPOSIT OR BOND.
   (a)    Before a landscape contractor commences any initial improvements or
landscaping on the site of any new building or commences any work in altering
the grade on any other property he shall deposit with the Building Commissioner
the sum of three hundred dollars ($300.00). This deposit may be paid in cash by
the contractor, by a certified check drawn on a solvent bank in Cuyahoga
County, Ohio, or by a cash performance bond drawn by a surety licensed by the
State of Ohio. Such deposit shall be a guarantee for repair, correction or
reconstruction of rear yard and side yard swales in the event that they have
not been constructed with the flow line set to the proper grade as indicated on
the drawings approved by the Municipal Engineer.
   (b)    Prior to any seeding, sodding or installation of any nursery stock
the landscape contractor shall contact the Building Commissioner to obtain an
inspection of the work completed. If, upon inspection, the Commissioner
determines that either or both the rear yard and side yard swales have not been
constructed with the flow line set to the proper grade as indicated on the
drawings approved by the Engineer, then the landscape contractor shall,
immediately upon being notified by the Commissioner, repair, correct or
reconstruct the swales in the manner indicated by the Engineer. If within seven
days after being notified by the Commissioner the landscape contractor has not
repaired, corrected or reconstructed the swales as indicated, then the
Municipality shall have the right, without further notice to the landscape
contractor and without notice to the owner of the property, to repair, correct
or reconstruct the swales in accordance with the drawings approved by the
Engineer and to reimburse itself from such deposit for all expenses so
incurred.
   (c)    If, upon inspection, the Commissioner determines that the rear yard
and side yard swales have been constructed with the flow line set to the proper
grade as indicated on the drawings approved by the Engineer then the deposit
shall be returned to the landscape contractor.
   (d)    This section shall not preclude the Municipality from prosecuting a
civil action against the landscape contractor if the cost to repair, correct or
reconstruct the swales is in excess of the deposit required herein.

   Copies of the Ohio Building Code adopted herein are on file with the
Building Commissioner for inspection by the public.
   1329.11 AMENDMENTS.
   The Ohio Building Code adopted herein is hereby amended as follows:
Special Provisions Applicable to Certificates of Occupancy for Multiple
Dwellings Only.
The following provisions shall apply to certificates of occupancy for multiple
dwellings.
   (a)   Original Certificates of Occupancy.
      (1)   The original certificate of occupancy shall be granted by the
Building Commissioner if he finds upon inspection that the building or other
structure is in compliance with the provision of this Code and all other laws,
ordinances, rules and regulations applicable thereto. The certificate shall
state the name and address of the owner, and, if the owner does not reside on
the premises, the name and address of the resident agent in charge of the
building or structure, and the name and address of the nonresident agent, if
any.
      (2)   The certificate of occupancy shall state the period for which it is
issued. The certificate shall not be valid beyond the last day of December in
the year for which it is issued. A renewal certificate shall be obtained each
year before February 1, subject to the provisions of subsection (a) hereof.
      (3)   The fee for a certificate of occupancy issued upon the completion
of an apartment building shall be as provided in Chapter
1309. Such fees shall accompany the application for certificate of occupancy or
renewal thereof and shall be nonrefundable.
   (b)   Changes; New Certificate of Occupancy and Fees.
      (1)   In the event there is a change in the resident agent or nonresident
agent as shown by the certificate of occupancy, the owner shall notify the
Building Commissioner in writing within 30 days of such change, giving the name
and address of the new resident agent or nonresident agent. Failure to so
notify the Commissioner within the specified time shall constitute a violation
of this Code.
      (2)   In the event there is a change in ownership of record, the
certificate of occupancy issued under the provisions of this Code to the former
owner shall become void within 30 days after the recorded date of such change
of ownership and a new certificate of occupancy must be obtained by the new
owner. Application for such new certificate of occupancy shall be made not more
than 30 days after such change of ownership has occurred on forms supplied by
the Commissioner. Such new certificate of occupancy shall expire on the same
date as that of the certificate which it replaces.
      (3)   A change in the nature or extent of the use or occupancy as
specified on the certificate of occupancy shall render the certificate of
occupancy void upon the happening of such change. No such change is permissible
under this Code unless such change has been approved by the municipal
authorities pursuant to this Code, and unless a new certificate of occupancy,
incorporating such change, has been issued. Any such change without the
approval of the proper municipal authorities will subject the owner, operator
or agent to the penalties provided in this Code. If such change involves the
addition of any dwelling units to the number of dwelling units previously
authorized, an additional fee as provided in Chapter 1309 shall be charged for
each such additional dwelling unit, regardless of the date authorized. Such new
certificate shall expire on the same date as that of the certificate which it
replaces.
   (c)   Revocation of Certificate of Occupancy.  The Building Commissioner
shall have the power to revoke a certificate of occupancy if any false
statement shall be made by the applicant in connection with the issuance of
such certificate, or for noncompliance of a structure or its use with the
requirements of this Code or if the owner, agent or person in charge of a
structure shall refuse to comply with any provision of this Code required to be
observed by him.
      (Ord. 98-28. Passed 9-28-98.)
   1329.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter or any Code adopted herein or
fails to comply with any lawful order issued pursuant thereto is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be fined not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000) or imprisoned not more than six months or both. Each day
during which noncompliance or a violation continues shall constitute a separate
offense. The Municipality may institute injunction proceedings in Common Pleas
Court to abate the nuisance of failure to cease work after receipt of a stop
work order as referred to in Section
1329.07.

   1337.02 ABANDONED AND INOPERATIVE GASOLINE SERVICE STATIONS.
   If any gasoline service station becomes abandoned, such station shall be
presumed to be a nuisance affecting or endangering surrounding property values
and to be detrimental to the public health, safety, convenience, comfort,
property or general welfare of the community and shall be abated. "Abandoned"
means failure to operate the service station as a gasoline service station, for
at least three consecutive months, or for at least three months in any
eighteen-month period.
   Whenever the Building Commissioner and Service Director shall find any
gasoline service station to be abandoned within the meaning of this section, he
shall give notice in the same manner as service of summons in civil cases, or
by certified mail, express mail, or any other commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt addressed to the
owner of record of the premises at his last known address or to the address to
which tax bills are sent, or by a combination of the foregoing methods, to
abate such abandoned condition within sixty days after service of the notice,
either by placing the station in operation in accordance with the ordinances of
the Municipality or adapting and using all buildings and land on the premises
for another purpose or purposes permitted by the ordinances of the
Municipality, removing the pumps and signs, abandoning underground storage
tanks in accordance with accepted safe practice as prescribed by the National
Fire Protection Association in Appendix C to N. F. P. A. No. 30, under the
supervision of the Fire Department of the Municipality and filling depressions
to the grade level of the lot.
   However, if the station is in operation as a gasoline service station at the
time the notice is served, and remains in continuous operation for at least
three months thereafter, the provisions of this section shall not apply; and if
there should be declared a national emergency which would curtail the operation
of motor vehicles or the sale of gasoline, or if Council shall determine that
there exists a state of general economic depression, the provisions of this
section shall not apply.
   Upon the failure, neglect or refusal of any owner to comply with the notice
to abate such abandonment, the Building Commissioner and Service Director shall
take such action as may be necessary to abate such nuisance, including without
limitation as to other remedies, the razing of the buildings on the premises,
and the owner shall be liable to the Municipality for any expense incurred by
the Municipality in abating the nuisance.
   Inoperative gasoline service stations which do not come within the
definition of abandoned service stations shall be maintained in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter and the owner shall cut all grass and remove
rubbish and weeds from the premises. The parking of motor vehicles upon the
premises shall in such case be prohibited and the owner shall place in the
window of the service station a sign of at least ten square feet in area
notifying the public of this fact. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
chapter, if the Building Commissioner and Service Director find that the notice
is not complied with by the public he may order the owner of the premises on
which any such station is inoperative for more than one month to install
fencing or barricade approved by the Building Commissioner and Service Director
which will be sufficient to block motor vehicle access to the property.

the utilities will be affected except when the removal is limited to a
relocation on the same or an abutting lot and no portion of any Municipal

approval or disapproval, and the permit shall not be issued without the
approval of the Board. All persons owning property abutting both sides of the

     1359.01 INTENT.
   Mayfield Village has determined that conserving its existing tree canopy is
beneficial to the community. Therefore, in order to protect and further the
public health, safety and general welfare and to promote the coexistence of
development and the natural environment, this Chapter establishes regulations
for tree preservation in connection with the clearing and grading of land for
construction-related or other purposes. More specifically the purposes of these
regulations are to:
   (a)    Encourage responsible development and minimize the negative
environmental impacts that can be associated with development.
   (b)    Encourage the preservation of trees in order to reduce air, water and
noise pollution; reduce the quantity of storm water run-off; protect natural
stream assets; and protect, and, where possible, enhance valuable natural water
resources.
   (c)    Ensure that residential subdivisions, business, and industrial
developments are carefully planned, designed and constructed to maintain and
preserve the natural features of the site.
   (d)    Ensure that proposed development integrates the natural features of a
site into the development in ways that maximize the site's ecosystem benefits,
including natural surface drainage and stabilization by minimizing grading
activities, the destruction of trees and the removal of topsoil to the extent
practicable.
   (e)    Improve property values by ensuring the natural and unique features
of the site are conserved, including mature trees, which studies show increase
the value of real estate. (Ord. 2020-07. Passed 5-18-20.)
   1359.02 PERMITTED LAND CLEARING.
   No person shall in any calendar year, remove or destroy or cause to remove
or destroy, by cutting, burning, bulldozing or any other means, more than three
(3) living trees having a diameter at breast height (DBH) of eight (8) inches
or greater on any lot or parcel of land within the Municipality without first
receiving a permit for such purpose from the Building Commissioner. Tree
cutting shall only be permitted when approved according to this Chapter and
only for purposes of grading or excavating an area in preparation for
construction thereon of dwellings, buildings or structures permitted in the
district in which the area is located, except as exempted in Section
1359.10. All tree removal and land clearing activities shall comply with the
regulations set forth in this Chapter.
(Ord. 2020-07. Passed 5-18-20.)
   1359.03 CUTTING OF TREES.
   (a)    Approval Required. There shall be no clear-cutting, timbering,
selective cutting, or commercial cutting of trees on any piece or parcel of
land located within the Village without a permit, except as otherwise exempted
in Section
1359.10.
   (b) Clear Cutting. Clear cutting, as used in this Chapter, means a system of
tree harvesting that removes all the trees in a given area. Clear-cutting is
prohibited, except to the extent necessary to clear a building site, yard,
driveway and right-of-way providing access to the site from a public street.
   (c)    Selective Cutting. As used in this Chapter, "timbering, selective
cutting or commercial cutting" means the cutting of trees having a DBH of eight
(8) inches or greater. Selective cutting of timber shall be permitted under the
following conditions, upon application to and approval of the Building
Commissioner, as follows:
      (1)    The Building Commissioner, the Engineer, an Arborist selected by
the Village and the property owner or his or her representative shall together
inspect the wooded area to be selectively cut in order to butt brand and paint
stripe the specific trees to be cut.
      (2)   Only trees so branded and marked shall be cut. Each unauthorized
cutting of an unmarked tree shall constitute a separate violation of the Zoning
Code and shall constitute grounds for the immediate revocation of the approval
to cut trees and/or any other permit issued.
         (Ord. 2020-07. Passed 5-18-20.)
        
   1359.04 APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS.
      For applications involving the removal or destruction of trees, the
applicant, who must be the owner of the parcel, shall provide:
   (a)    The address or a legal description of each lot or parcel, or in lieu
thereof, a description of sufficient detail so that such lot or parcel may be

   (b)    A statement of the kind, number and dimensions of the trees to be
removed, including the diameter of the tree measured at breast height (DBH);
   (c)    The name and address of the owner of the parcel and the name and
address of each person who shall engage in the cutting or removal of trees on
such parcel, either under contract or any other arrangement with the owner; and
   (d)    A copy of the contract covering such arrangement for the cutting or
removal of trees, or if there is no such contract reduced to writing, a
succinct statement of the terms and provisions of such arrangement.
      (Ord. 2020-07. Passed 5-18-20.)
   1359.05 ISSUANCE OF TREE REMOVAL PERMIT.
   Within ten (10) days of receipt of an application for tree removal, the
Building Commissioner, Engineer and an Arborist selected by the Village, shall
review the matter and the Building Commissioner shall issue to the applicant a
permit specifying the trees that are permitted to be removed. If, in the
opinion of the Building Commissioner, Engineer and Arborist, there are
additional trees that should be removed or destroyed because their location is
such that they shall suffer extensive damage during any proposed construction
resulting in their ultimate death, these additional trees will be permitted to
be removed and will be included in the permit, whether or not they were
included in the original application.
   In no event shall the removal or destruction of trees be permitted prior to
the approval of the preliminary plan of a new subdivision, or if no new
subdivision is to be created, prior to the approval of a development plan or
the issuing of a building permit for construction.
(Ord. 2020-07. Passed 5-18-20.)
   1359.06 APPEAL TO BOARD OF APPEALS.
   Within ten (10) days of receipt of the permit issued by the Building
Commissioner, the applicant may appeal the terms of the permit to the Board of
Appeals. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of an appeal, the Board of Appeals
shall set a date for hearing and shall notify, in writing, the applicant and
any other persons whom the Board deems to have an interest in the matter, at
least five (5) days prior to the hearing. The Board of Appeals shall consider
the recommendation of the Building Commissioner, Engineer and Arborist, as well
as any and all additional evidence presented by the applicant and other persons
at the hearing. The Board of Appeals shall determine whether the permit shall
be expanded and may attach such conditions as it deems necessary to promote the
public welfare. The Board of Appeals shall not expand the permit if it finds
that such removal or destruction of trees is reasonably likely to cause soil
erosion, result in pollution or an unreasonably large loss of oxygen,
interference with drainage and the natural supply of water, or that it will
result in an unsightly and blighted condition, or will depress property value
in the Municipality. (Ord. 2020-07. Passed 5-18-20.)
   1359.07 APPEAL TO COUNCIL.
   If the Board of Appeals denies the appeal of the applicant or attaches
conditions to its approval, the applicant may appeal in writing to Council
within thirty (30) days after notification by the Board of Appeals of its
decision. Council, by a vote of the majority of the members elected thereto,
shall at its next regularly scheduled meeting affirm, reverse or modify the
decision of the Board of Appeals, subject to the limitations set forth in this
chapter. Council shall not expand the permit if it finds that such removal or
destruction of trees is reasonably likely to cause soil erosion, result in
pollution or an unreasonably large loss of oxygen, interference with drainage
and the natural supply of water, or that it will result in an unsightly and
blighted condition, or will depress property value in the Municipality.
(Ord. 2020-07. Passed 5-18-20.)
   1359.08 RESTRAINING INJUNCTION PERMITTED.
   The Law Director or the owner of any property which will be damaged by the
violation of this Chapter is hereby authorized to apply to a court of general
jurisdiction for an injunction to restrain violations of this Chapter.
(Ord. 2020-07. Passed 5-18-20.)
   1359.09 PERMIT; FEE; BOND.
   The fee for a tree removal permit shall be as provided in Chapter
1309. The Building Commissioner is authorized to require the filing by the
applicant of a bond, the penal sum of which shall be in an amount which the
Commissioner reasonably estimates will be sufficient to pay the cost and
expense of removing the rubble and refuse resulting from the cutting and
removal of the trees. All such rubble and refuse shall be removed from the
premises in such a manner that no fire hazard will result therefrom. The
sureties on the bond shall be approved by the Mayor and the Law Director, as to
form.

   1375.01 FACTUAL BASIS.
   (a)   The flood hazard areas of Mayfield Village are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.
   (b)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities
and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately flood-proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss.
(Ord. 92-9. Passed 3-16-92.)
   1375.02 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private loss due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief effort associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
   (h)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
      (Ord. 92-9. Passed 3-16-92.)
   1375.03 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
      (Ord. 92-9. Passed 3-16-92.)

   (e)   Interpretation of Flood Boundaries. Make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions). Where a map boundary and field
elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood elevation profile
shall prevail. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in
Section
1375.15.
      (Ord. 92-9. Passed 3-16-92.)
   1375.15 VARIANCE PROCEDURE.

Village Engineer in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
      (3)   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Commission or any taxpayer,
may appeal such decision to the Court of Common Pleas as provided in Ohio R.C.
Chapter 2506.
      (4)   In passing upon such applications, the Commission shall consider
all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where
applicable;
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood plain management program for that area;
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and

      (5)   Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (a)(4) hereof and
the purposes of this chapter, the Commission may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
chapter.
      (6)   The Village Engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variance to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon
request.
   (b)   Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing the items in subsection (a)(4) hereof
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre,
the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (2)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this section.
      (3)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance shall not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in
subsection (a)(4) hereof, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (6)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure shall be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
         (Ord. 92-9. Passed 3-16-92.)
   1375.16 PROVISIONS OF FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   (a)   General Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards the following
standards are required:
      (1)   Anchoring.
         A.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
         B.   All manufactured homes not otherwise regulated by the Ohio
Revised Code pertaining to manufactured home parks shall be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Methods
of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or
frame ties to ground anchors.
      (2)   Construction materials and methods.
         A.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.
         B.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.

discharge from the systems into flood water; and
         C.   Individual waste water treatment systems shall be located to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      (4)   Subdivision proposals.
         A.   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
         B.   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood
damage; and
         C.   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood
damage; and
         D.   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals, including manufactured home subdivisions, and other proposed
developments which contain at least fifty lots or five acres, whichever is
less.
   (b)   Standards in Areas of Special Flood Hazard Without Base Flood
Elevation Data. In all areas of special flood hazard identified as Zone A on
the Flood Insurance Rate Map where base flood elevation data are not available
from any source, the following provisions apply:
      (1)   New construction and substantial improvement of any residential,
commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall have the lowest
floor, including basement, elevated to at least two feet above the highest
adjacent natural grade.
   (c)   Specific Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base
flood elevation data have been provided as set forth in Sections
1375.06  or
1375.14 (b), the following provisions are required:
      (1)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including

      (2)   Nonresidential construction.
         A.   New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest
floor, including basement, elevated to the level of the base flood elevation;
or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:
            1.   Be floodproofed so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water to the level of the base
flood elevation. In order to be eligible for lower flood insurance rates, the
structure should be floodproofed at least one foot above the base flood
elevation.
            2.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
            3.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with
accepted standards of practice for meeting the standards of this subsection.
Such certification shall be provided to the officials as set forth in Section
1375.11(c).
      (3)   Accessory structures.

be granted for accessory structures, such as sheds or detached garages,
containing 576 square feet or less in gross floor area. Such structures shall
meet the encroachment provisions of subsection (d)(1) hereof and the following
additional standards:
            1.   They shall not be used for human habitation;
            2.   They shall be designed to have low flood damage potential;
            3.   They shall be constructed and placed on the building site so
as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of flood waters;
            4.   They shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation; and
            5.   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment
shall be elevated or floodproofed.
      (4)   Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
         A.   The following standards shall apply to all new and substantially
improved manufactured homes not subject to the manufactured home requirements
of Ohio R.C. 3733.01:
            1.   Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with
subsection (a)(1)B. hereof;
            2.   Manufactured homes shall be elevated on a permanent foundation
such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at the base flood
elevation.
         B.   These standards also apply to recreational vehicles that are
either:
            1.   Located on sites for 180 days or more; or
            2.   Are not fully licensed and ready for highway use.
      (5)   Enclosures below the lowest floor. The following standards apply to
all new and substantially improved residential and nonresidential structures
which are elevated to the base flood elevation using pilings, columns or posts.
Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and
which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement shall:
         A.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or
         B.   Meet or exceed the following criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
openings provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
   (d)   Areas With Floodways. The Flood Insurance Study referenced in Section
1375.06 identifies a segment within areas of special flood hazard known as a
floodway. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of flood
information as specified in Section
1375.14(b). The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential.
The following provisions apply within all delineated floodway areas:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development unless a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practices
demonstrates that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   If subsection (d)(1) hereof is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of subsection (c) hereof.
      (3)   Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an
increase in base flood elevations can only be granted upon the prior approval
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Such requests shall be submitted by
the Village Engineer to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and shall meet
the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
         (Ord. 92-9. Passed 3-16-92.)
   1375.99 PENALTY.
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor of the first degree. Any person
who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements
(including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection
with conditions) shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of Mayfield Village. Each day such violation continues

development is the owner thereof, he should give written notification to each
prospective tenant before entering into a lease with such rental units that
they may be converted to condominiums within such period.
   (b)    Notice of Conversion and Public Offering Statement. A developer of a
conversion condominium development shall deliver to each of the tenants in
possession written notice of conversion and the public offering statement not
less than 120 days before requiring the tenant to vacate, provided that in the
case of any tenant who is over sixty years of age, or who is deaf or blind or
who is unable to walk without assistance, the developer shall deliver such
notice of conversion and the public offering statement not less than 180 days
before requiring such tenant to vacate.
   (c)    Appropriate Notices. A developer of a conversion condominium
development shall deliver appropriate notices of conversion based upon his best
knowledge and information as to the age or health of each tenant, No tenant who
receives other than a 180 day notice of conversion shall be deemed to be
entitled to a 180 day notice unless within fifteen days of receipt of such
inappropriate notice the tenant delivers a written statement to the developer
declaring that the tenant is over sixty years of age or is deaf or blind or is
unable to walk without assistance, and in such case such statement shall be
presumed to be true in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
   (d)    Expiration of Tenancy Before End of Notice Period. Any tenant whose
tenancy expires other than for cause before the expiration of 120 days from the
date of delivery of such notice of conversion shall have the right to an
additional tenancy on the same terms and conditions and for the same rental
until the expiration of such 120 day period by the giving of written notice
thereof by the tenant to the developer within thirty days of the date of
delivery of such notice of conversion, provided that in the case of any tenant
who is over sixty years of age, or who is deaf or blind or who is unable to
walk without assistance, such tenant shall have the right to an additional
tenancy on the same terms and conditions and for the same rental until the

of delivery of such notice of conversion shall have the right to terminate the
lease upon forty-five days written notice, without penalty or other termination
charge to the tenant. By delivering the notice of termination, the tenant
waives the right of first refusal under subsection (h) hereof.

received notification under subsection (a) hereof before entering into a lease.
   (f)   Contents of Notice of Conversion.
      (1)    The notice of conversion shall include a copy of this chapter as

tenant that he may advise the Building Department of any structural or
mechanical defects in the building or common areas and of any unhealthful or
unsafe conditions therein which the tenant believes should be corrected.

residence, which may be the address of the property subject to the lease, sent
by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, with sufficient
prepaid postage, affixed to carry it to its destination. A tenant's refusal to
accept delivery shall be deemed adequate service. If such mailing is returned
to developer undelivered to the tenant for any reason other than refusal of the
tenant to accept delivery, the developer shall forthwith remail the mailing by
regular United States mail, and such remailing shall be deemed to be delivered
on the third day after it is deposited in the mail. Personal delivery is
permissable if service cannot be made by United States mail.

prospective purchasers other than the tenant at a price not less than offered
to the tenant or on terms not more favorable than offered to the tenant, and
each contract for sale of the unit shall conspicuously disclose the existence
of, and shall be subject to, such right of first refusal.
      (3)    If during such period the tenant fails to purchase the unit, the
developer shall not offer to sell that unit during the following ninety days at
a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms

shall have ten days therefrom within which to accept the offer.
   (i)    Co-tenant's Rights.
      (1)    If there is more than one tenant leasing a unit then each such
tenant shall be entitled to contract for the purchase of a proportionate share
of the unit and of a proportionate share of the share of any tenant who elects
not to purchase.
      (2)    In no case shall this provision be deemed to authorize the

      (2)    Except in the case of an emergency, or unless it is impracticable
to do so, the developer shall give the tenant reasonable notice of his intent
to enter and may answer only at reasonable times. Twenty-four hours is presumed
to be a reasonable notice in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
      (3)    The developer shall not abuse the right of access or use it to
harass the tenant. Entry by the developer in excess of twice in any seven day
period for the purpose of showing the unit to purchasers shall be presumed to
be an abuse of the right of access in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
   (l)    Nonwaiverability of Obligations and Rights. Neither the obligations
nor the rights under this section may be waived in a contract of lease, a
contract of sale or otherwise, and any attempted waiver is void.

receive from the developer an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the sales
price of the unit as liquidated damages.

addition to the tenant's right to cancel under subsection (j) hereof.
