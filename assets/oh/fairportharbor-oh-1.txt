   WHEREAS, the Council of the Village of Fairport Harbor, Ohio, has had the
matter of recodification and general revision of the ordinances before it for
some time, and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such recodification, and
   WHEREAS, the recodification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council,
   NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the Village of Fairport
Harbor, State of Ohio:
   SECTION 1. The ordinances of the Village of Fairport Harbor, Ohio, of a
general and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated
into component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved,
adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Fairport Harbor, Ohio, 1986.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk-Treasurer, attached to this ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of the Village of
Fairport Harbor, Ohio.
   SECTION 2. The provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions of the
Codified Ordinances shall be in full force and effect immediately after passage
of this Ordinance and approval by the Mayor. All ordinances resolutions or
parts thereof, enacted prior to June 15, 1986, which are inconsistent with any
provision of the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective
date of this ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege.
      (2)   The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property.
      (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment.
      (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation.
      (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other

summary of new matter contained in the Codified Ordinances. Copies of the
Codified Ordinances shall be posted in the five most public places as required
by law. All sections of the Codified Ordinances, without a previous ordinance
or resolution history at the end thereof, indicate that the section contains
new matter ordained by this Adopting Ordinance. The Comparative Section Table
lists by section number all sections which contain new matter adopted by this
Adopting Ordinance.
   SECTION 4. This ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety
of the Village, and for the further reason that there exists an imperative
necessity for the earliest publication and distribution of the Codified
Ordinances to the officials and citizens of the Village, so as to facilitate
administration, daily operation and avoid practical and legal entanglements,
wherefore, this ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and
immediately after its passage and approval by the Mayor.

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

done on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
         B.   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last
day for doing the act or before its usual closing time on that day, the act may

101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
 
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance. (ORC 1.54)
 
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

re-enactments or amendments thereof. (ORC 1.55)
 
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included. (ORC 1.56)
 
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
 
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
 
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended. (ORC 1.47)
 
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
 
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

105.02   Record requests.
105.03   Costs for public records.
105.04   E-mail.
 
105.01 PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   In accordance with the Ohio Revised Code and applicable judicial
decisions, records are defined as any item that:
      (1)   Contains information stored on a fixed medium (such as paper,
electronic, including but not limited to email, and other formats);
      (2)   Is created or received by, or sent under the jurisdiction of a
public office and
      (3)   Documents the organization, functions, policies, decisions,
procedures, operations or other activities of the office.
   (b)   Public records are to be open to the public at all reasonable times
with exceptions only as provided for in the law.
      (1)   As required by Ohio law, records will be organized and maintained
so that they are readily available for inspection and copying within a
reasonable period of time during regular business hours. Record retention
schedules are to be updated regularly.
         (Res. 2007-112. Passed 10-2-07.)
105.02 RECORD REQUESTS.
   Each request for public records should be evaluated for a response using the
following guidelines:
   (a)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian may contact
the requester for clarification, and should let the requestor revise the
request by informing the requestor of the manner in which the office keeps its
records.
   (b)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing, and
does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record. It is this office’s general policy that if this
information is requested upon disclosure that the requester may decline to give
the information.
   (c)   Public records that are requested are to be available for inspection
during regular business hours, with the exception of published holidays. Public
records must be made available for inspection promptly. Copies of public
records must be made available within a reasonable period of time. “Prompt” and
“reasonable” take into account the volume of records requested; the proximity
of the location where the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal
review of the records requested.
   (d)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records.
   (e)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority. If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released. If there
are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation,
including legal authority.
      (Res. 2007-112. Passed 10-2-07.)
105.03 COSTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual cost of making
copies.
   (a)   There will be a charge for copies.
   (b)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is one
dollar ($1.00) per disc.
   (c)   There is no charge for documents e-mailed.
   (d)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. They will be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies.
      (Res. 2007-112. Passed 10-2-07.)
105.04 E-MAIL.
   (a)   Records in private e-mail accounts used to conduct public business are
subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of this office are
instructed to retain their e- mails that relate to public business (see 105.01
Public Records) and to copy them to their business e-mail accounts and/or to
the office’s records custodian.
   (b)   The records custodian is to treat the e-mails from private accounts as
records of the public office, filing them in the appropriate way, retaining
them per established schedules and making them available for inspection and
copying in accordance with the Public Records Act.

account, financial depository-issued credit card account, affinity credit card
account, or any other card account allowing the holder to purchase goods or

   (e)   Types of Expenses Authorized.
      (1)   Credit card account purchases must be for proper public purposes.
Expenditures must be for authorized Village work related expenses that benefit
the Village. Examples of appropriate expenditures are:
         A.   Tools to complete Village tasks and owned by the Village,
including online purchases
         B.   Materials and/or supplies that are necessary for completion of a
Village project or task, including online purchases

instances where the lowest best vendor will not accept a Village purchase
order, including online purchases.
      (2)   Credit Card accounts cannot be used for the following expenses:
         A.   Personal expense, including but not limited to entertainment,
personal goods or personal services. Any purchase/use for personal benefit
rather than the benefit of the Village is an unauthorized use and misuse of a
credit card.
         B.   Alcohol.
         C.   Cash Withdrawals - No officer or employee of the Village shall
make a cash withdrawal (to include additional cash with purchase).
         D.   Refunds - No officer or employee of the Village shall accept a
cash refund. Any refund or credit for returned materials, goods, or services
must be entered by the Vendor against the Credit Card for the Village.

purchased by the Mayor or Village Administrator for the purpose of employee
recognition. The Fiscal Officer shall separately track said purchase
exceptions.
      (3)   No late charges or finance charges shall be allowed unless

   (f)   Procedure for Management of Credit Card Accounts.

provider, payment of credit card bills, managing issuance, cancellation of
accounts and ensuring proper use.
      (2)   The Fiscal Officer shall retain general possession and control of
all credit card accounts and presentation instruments (credit cards) related to
the accounts.
      (3)   Village credit cards retained by the Fiscal Officer shall be
safeguarded when not in use.
      (4)   The Fiscal Officer shall establish a system to sign out credit
cards to authorized users.
      (5)   The Fiscal Officer shall maintain a list of all authorized users.
In those cases where designees are in place and need to be added or removed
from the list of authorized users, Department heads shall notify the Fiscal
Officer in writing of these changes.
      (6)   The Fiscal Officer may/shall develop additional internal accounting
controls for management and use of credit card accounts.
   (g)   Procedure for Credit Card Use and Sign out System.
      (1)   The Name "Village of Fairport Harbor" shall appear on each
"presentation instrument" (credit card) related to any credit card account
      (2)   Authorized users will sign a written acknowledgement indicating
they have received a copy of the policy, understand the intent of the
guidelines and agree to adhere to those policies. The Fiscal officer will
retain a signed copy of the acknowledgment.
      (3)   Authorized Users will sign out a credit card in each instance of
use, listing their name, date, Vendor, and reason for purchase. The credit card
will be returned within twenty-four hours unless being used for travel. On
those occasions where the card is required on a Friday, the card shall be
returned before the close of that workday.
      (4)   Credit Card use will still require the normal appropriation and
encumbrance system to be followed. All purchases via credit card must assure
that all purchases have sufficient funds appropriated and encumbered to cover
the purchase. Purchase orders must be obtained prior to making the purchase.
      (5)   Itemized Receipts.
         A.   For every transaction/use of a credit card, the Authorized User
must submit an itemized receipt to the Fiscal Officer or their designee as soon
as practical, but in no event later than the return of the credit card
         B.   The itemized receipt shall be identified to the Fiscal Officer or
their designee as to purchase order and or project, whether in writing on the
receipt or attached to a copy of the purchase order.
         C.   For all travel related expenses, purchases must comply with
itemized receipt procedures and turned in to the Fiscal Officer no later than
four days after the business related travel is complete.
         D.   Credit Card statements will not suffice for an itemized receipt.
         E.   Missing documentation (itemized receipts) may result in the User
being held responsible for the purchase expense.
 
   (h)   Personal Liability. The officer or employee is liable in person and
upon any official bond the officer or employee has given to the Village to
reimburse the treasury of the Village the amount for which the officer or
employee does not provide itemized receipts in accordance with this policy.
   (i)   Actions or Omissions that Qualify as Misuse of a Credit Card Account.
      (1)   Use of the card for cash advances, personal purchases (which may
include, but are not necessarily limited to, gratuities and excess daily meal
allowance, gasoline for a personal vehicle, and alcoholic beverages), and/or
purchases on behalf of someone other than the Village are absolutely
prohibited.
      (2)   Permitting anyone other than the Authorized User who signed out the
card to use it for any purpose.
      (3)   Failure to use the card in accordance with the control limits
established for it.
   
Notice:
The use of a credit card account for expenses beyond those authorized by the
Village Council constitutes misuse of a credit card account. Any officer or
employee who knowingly misuses a Village credit card account violates 2913.21
of the Revised Code.
   (j)   Procedure for Problems Related to the Account Including Cards and
Checks.
(1)   The situation may arise where there is a problem with a purchased item or
service. Examples include broken merchandise, the billed amount does not match
the quote, the billed amount includes sales tax, the statement contains a
charge not recognized by the Authorized User, or the statement contains
duplicate charges from a vendor. In these instances, the Authorized User should
try to resolve the dispute with the supplier or merchant. If the purchased item
needs to be returned for any reason, send the item back to the supplier and
request a credit to the account card. The Authorized User should notify the
Fiscal Officer so subsequent statements can be monitored for the credit. The
Village cannot accept cash or a rain check instead of a vendor credit. If the
dispute cannot be resolved, the Authorized User should contact the Fiscal
Officer.
   (k)   Procedure for Credit Card Cancellation and the Process for Reporting
Lost or Stolen Credit Cards.
      (1)   The Authorized User shall report a lost or stolen credit card
immediately to the card issuer and the Fiscal Officer. Further use of the card
will be blocked. Prompt action will reduce the liability for fraudulent
charges. The Authorized User must confirm the phone call by written
notification to the card issuer via mail or fax, with copies promptly given to
the Fiscal Officer. The date and time of the phone report of the lost or stolen
card shall be included in the written notification. The Village will initiate
issuance of a replacement card.
   (l)   Membership Cards.
      (1)   The Village may maintain a membership to Sam's Club or other
similar memberships in an effort to save costs on supplies for the Village.
      (2)   Council shall designate the officers/employees who are entitled to
usage of these memberships and shall determine how many membership cards are
issued to those individuals.
      (3)   All purchases made using these memberships for Village business
shall be tax exempt from Ohio sales tax. Employees are responsible for
informing vendors of the sales tax exemption. If requested by a vendor, a State
of Ohio sales tax exemption certificate is available from the Auditor's office.
   (m)   Council's Periodic Review and Annual Report.
      (1)   The Village Council shall review quarterly the number of cards and
accounts issued, the number of active cards and accounts issued, the cards' and
accounts' expiration dates, and the cards' and accounts' credit limit.
      (2)   The Fiscal Officer quarterly shall file a report with the Village
Council detailing all rewards received based on the use of the Village's credit
card account(s).

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
161. Mayor's Court
CHAPTER 161
Mayor's Court
161.01   Computer Fund.
161.02   Magistrate.
161.03   Clerk.
161.04      Violations Bureau; transferring complaint.
161.05      Waivable offenses; schedule.
 
 
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and Criminal
Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged with an
offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is such
that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before him
and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipalty and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

171.02 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)    Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this
chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the
ORC, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the ORC and the use is not consistent, then the use of the
term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall
control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the ORC.
   (B)    The singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall
include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   (C)    As used in this chapter:
      (1)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file
as a C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C
corporation under (C)(24)(d) of this division, means a C corporation's federal
taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
         (a)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal
taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income.
         (b)    Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (C)(1)(a) of this section, but excluding that portion
of intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of property described in Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (c)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or

Revenue Code;
         (d)   (i)    Except as provided in (C)(1)(d)(ii) of this section,

extent the income or gain is income or gain described in Section 1245 or 1250
of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (e)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction
in the computation of federal taxable income;
         (f)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated

The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is
reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
            (ii)    No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (C)
(1)(h) of this section to offset qualifying wages.
            (iii)   (a)    For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020,

than fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the deduction otherwise allowed by
division (C)(1)(h)(i) of this section.
               (b)    For taxable years beginning in 2023 or thereafter, a
person may deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a municipal

allowed by (C)(1)(h)(i) of this section.

section. To the extent that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully
utilized in one or more taxable years by operation of division (C)(1)(h)(iii)
(a) of this section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed
for a taxable year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation

compute adjusted federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer
were a C corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid
or accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless
such payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as
payment of interest under Section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United
States treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-
employed retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer,
amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts
paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.

on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. This

commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities

nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
   (C)    For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to "Municipal

section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the
Village for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.

business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever

taxes are not required to be withheld under

         (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Village to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same
period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Village, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of

171.12 (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F) (2) (a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by
171.12 (A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits

         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this

liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer

behalf of the Village in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the Village in any month of the preceding calendar
quarter exceeded $200.
Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made so that the
payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the
last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
         (c)    Intentionally left blank.
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the Village as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold Village income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the Village the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to a
Village income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for Village during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year,;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar yea;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold Village income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under
the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section
Occasional Entrant - Withholding.
   (C)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Employer" includes a person that is a related member to or of
an employer.
         (b)    "Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing business in
this state, such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar location owned
or controlled by an employer.
         (c)    "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.

         (g)    "Worksite location" means a construction site or other
temporary worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for
more than 20 days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not
include the home of an employee.
      (2)   (a)    Subject to divisions (C)(3), (5), (6), and (7) of this
section, an employer is not required to withhold Village income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the Village if the employee performed such services in the Village on 20 or
fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Village.
            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Village. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
Village at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a
calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than 20 days" if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:
               (a)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.
            (iii)    The employee is a resident of the Village and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in
171.04.
            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the Village than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee
spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)    Traveling from any location to another location in order
to pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property
that has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            (iv)    Transporting or delivering property described in division
(C)(2)(b)(iii) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property,
the employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real
estate owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's
employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Village exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to the Village for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in the Village.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village
under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
Village for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to
the employee for personal services performed in the Village.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the Village and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in
171.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Village, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the Village.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of
171.04.
(Ord. 2015-094. Passed 11-17-15.)
171.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)    An annual Village income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every individual taxpayer eighteen (18) years of age or older and any taxpayer
that is not an individual for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is
subject to the tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under
171.05 of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due the Village.
      (2)    Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for Village income tax
purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which
retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the Village, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the Village, the return or notice required of that individual shall

perjury.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and,
with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to
support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who
files the annual return required by this section electronically is not required
to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Village to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)   (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each return
required to be filed under this section shall be completed and filed as
required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed for the
filing of state individual income tax returns under division (G) of Section
5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice
on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the Village . No remittance is required if the net

         (b)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall completer and file the return of
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the Village. No remittance is required
if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Village's income tax
return. The extended due date of Village's income tax return shall be the 15th
day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Village's income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's the Village income tax return. If the request is received
by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Village income tax return is
due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a
Village's income tax return. The extended due date of Village's income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Village, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Village shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Village an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section.
   (I)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (B)(1)(a) of
171.04 or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the Village by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in
171.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the Village, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the Village and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Village to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Village, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the
Village or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this
chapter and of the Village's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the
Village's income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or
extension for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of
amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)    Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the Village
for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time
for payment of taxes required by the Village during the period of the member's
or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)    For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.

return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (R)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to Village's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Village income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the Village. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated
Village income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated Village
income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer
requests and receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a
separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Village income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States department of treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in
171.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section (2)(C)(1) to the
extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment
has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal
taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
171.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
171.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall
not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's
net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
171.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Village;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Village income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Village income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of
171.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the Village in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (Y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

171.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the Village who is required to
and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed the tax due the Village under this chapter.
 
   (B)    Village shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Village who works in a joint economic development zone created under
Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under Section
715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
 
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
 
   (D)    Intentionally left blank.
(Ord. 2015-094. Passed 11-17-15.)
171.07 ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the Village's income tax for
the current taxable year.
      (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the Village for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for the Village from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the Village in equal amounts on each payment date unless
the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld,
in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the
amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of

taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Village,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability
for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of
the taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
171.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to
171.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Village under
171.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in Village but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 2015-094. Passed 11-17-15.)
171.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 2015-094. Passed 11-17-15.)
171.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
171.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars or more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under
171.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
171.18 (A)(4).
(Ord. 2015-094. Passed 11-17-15.)
171.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the Village, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the Village as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
 
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village is subject to recovery by the Village. If
the Village's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, Village shall
allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding Village claims is
due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid
to the first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
 
   (C)    If the Village's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using Village's
tax rate. However, if Village's tax rate is greater than the tax rate in the
other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is to be
paid to Village, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during the
period of nonpayment.
 
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2015-094. Passed 11-17-15.)
171.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the Village changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal
or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
Village. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
171.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of
Section
171.12 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the Village. A request filed under this division shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in
171.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to Village
income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Village income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars.

penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section

limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in
171.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after

required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in
171.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by
171.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of
171.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover Village income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

171.13 AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
 
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
 
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
 
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
 
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
 
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 2014-094. Passed 11-17-15.)
171.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Village official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.

to the Village that arises pursuant to Village's income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-094. Passed 11-17-15.)
171.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
 
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Village from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-094. Passed 11-17-15.)
171.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Village ordinance or state law
to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of

      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or

before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to

the Village to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.

171.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)    Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the

memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         (b)    The powers referred to in this division of this section shall
be exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance
of the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the
Village's income tax ordinance;
      (2)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax

      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and

period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to

for the income tax levied by the Village or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that

affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying

171.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in

identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of
171.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to
171.18.
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in
171.99 for a violation of
171.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.

the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not

meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall

remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
      (6)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons

within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax

provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.

   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property. If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may

private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private

the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the

unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.

a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.

      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
331.43.
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a
utility.
   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the
duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio Director of
Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes the course,
the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender
submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and such written
evidence.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(ORC 4511.13)
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall

   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
or a combination of them as described in this section when a person submits to
a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request of a law
enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine sample is
obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered nurse, an
emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical technician-
paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall withdraw a
blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, controlled
substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the
whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does not apply to
the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood
under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this subsection, if in
that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person would be endangered
by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic

      (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
 
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
 
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

vehicle is the subject of an immobilization waiver order issued under Ohio R.C.
4503.235 and the other person is prohibited from operating the vehicle under
that order.
   (b)   Without limiting or precluding the consideration of any other evidence
in determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5)
of this section has occurred, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the
offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the operator of the
motor vehicle owned by the offender or under the offender’s control is in a
category described in subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5) of this section
if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Regarding an operator allegedly in the category described in

this section.
      (1)   Except as provided in subsection (c)(2) of this section, whoever

Ohio R.C. 2705.02.
      (2)   A.   If, within three years of a violation of subsection (a)(1),
(2) or (3) of this section, the offender previously has pleaded guilty to or
been convicted of two or more violations of division (A)(1), (2) or (3) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offender
is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree.
         B.   Whoever violates subsection (a)(4) or (5) of this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (3)   For any violation of this section, in addition to the penalties

section, the court may order, for thirty days, the immobilization of the
vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license
plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C.
4503.233.
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the court may order, for sixty days, the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to
the state of the vehicle involved in the offense. If issued, the order shall be
issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as
determined by publications of the national automobile dealer’s association. The
proceeds from any fine imposed under this subsection shall be distributed in
accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the
immobilization before the termination of the period of immobilization ordered
unless the court is presented with current proof of financial responsibility
with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the
registration of the vehicle.
   (f)   This section does not apply to motor vehicle rental dealers or motor
vehicle leasing dealers, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4549.65.
   (g)   Evidence of a conviction of, plea of guilty to, or adjudication as a
delinquent child for a violation of this section or a substantially similar
municipal ordinance shall not be admissible as evidence in any civil action
that involves the offender or delinquent child who is the subject of the
conviction, plea, or adjudication and that arises from the wrongful entrustment
of a motor vehicle.
   (h)   For purposes of this section, a vehicle is owned by a person if, at
the time of a violation of this section, the vehicle is registered in the
person’s name. (ORC 4511.203)

license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver’s
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.
2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be sentenced to a jail
term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community residential sanction
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division (A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C.

notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be
ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community
service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an offender to complete a
term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect
criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.
4507.35 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a
misdemeanor of the first degree. (ORC 4507.35)

violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

for thirty days and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license plates for thirty
days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         B.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

of two violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11 or Ohio R.C. 4510.111 or 4510.16, or of
a substantially similar municipal ordinance, the court, in addition to any
other sentence that it imposes on the offender may order the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11, or any
combination of three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4501.11 or Ohio R.C.

State.
   (e)   Any order for immobilization and impoundment under this section shall
be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.233 and 4507.02, as applicable. The

section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (f)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order
from the court, neither the Ohio Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy
registrar shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of
registration of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the
declaration of forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five
years after the date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or

under this section and who, during the suspension, operates any motor vehicle
upon any public roads and highways is guilty of driving under a twelve-point
suspension, a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court shall sentence the
offender to a minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the
first three days of jail time imposed pursuant to this subsection. (ORC

occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:

that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.

or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
         C.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject to
the payment of a fee established by the Municipality in accordance with this
section.
      (2)   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a permit
under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Municipality, with respect to
highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good cause
shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,

section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
   (i)   A permit issued by the Municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer. (ORC 4513.34)

381.05 OPERATING REGULATIONS.
   The following rules for preventing collisions shall be followed in the
navigation of all public and private watercraft operating upon the waters of
this Village.
   (a)   Every watercraft which is under way propelled by sail alone shall be
considered a sailboat. Every watercraft which is under way propelled by sail
and machinery shall be considered a powercraft. Every watercraft shall be
considered under way when it is not at anchor or made fast to the shore or
aground. In addition to any other situation, risk of collision shall be
determined to exist whenever the compass bearing of the approaching watercraft
remains substantially the same.
   (b)   When two sailboats are approaching one another so as to involve the
risk of collision, one of them shall keep out of the way of the other, as
follows, namely:
      (1)   When one sailboat has the wind on the port side and the other has
the wind on the starboard side, the sailboat with the wind on the port side
shall keep out of the way of the sailboat with the wind on the starboard side.
      (2)   When both sailboats have the wind on the same side, the sailboat
which is to the windward shall keep out of the way of the sailboat which is
leeward.
      (3)   When a sailboat with the wind on the port side sees a sailboat to
windward and cannot determine with certainty whether the other sailboat has the
wind on the port or the starboard side, it shall keep out of the way of the
other sailboat.
   (c)   When two powercraft are meeting on reciprocal or nearly reciprocal
courses, so as to involve the risk of collision, each shall alter its course to
starboard, so that each shall pass on the port side of the other.
   (d)   When two powercraft are crossing at right angles or obliquely, so as
to involve the risk of collision, the powercraft which has the other on its own
starboard side shall keep out of the way and shall, if possible, avoid crossing
ahead of the other.
   (e)   When a powercraft and a sailboat are proceeding in such directions as
to involve the risk of collision, the powercraft shall yield the right of way o
the sailboat, except when the sailboat is overtaking the powercraft.
   (f)   Every watercraft which is directed by these rules to yield the right
of way to another watercraft shall, on approaching such other watercraft, if
necessary, slacken its speed, stop, reverse, or alter course. Where, by any of
the rules prescribed by this chapter, one of two watercraft shall yield the
right of way, the other shall keep its course and speed.
   (g)   Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules, every watercraft
overtaking another shall yield the right of way to the overtaken watercraft.
Every watercraft coming up with another watercraft from any direction more than
twenty-two and one-half degrees abaft the other's beam, that is, at such a
position with reference to the watercraft which it is overtaking that at night
it would be unable to see either of the other's side or combination bow lights,
is an overtaking watercraft; and no subsequent alteration of bearing between
the two watercraft shall make the overtaking watercraft a crossing watercraft
within the meaning of these rules, or relieve it of the duty of keeping clear
of the overtaken watercraft until it is finally passed and clear. If the
overtaking watercraft is in doubt as to whether it is forward of or abaft this
direction from the other watercraft, it should assume that it is an overtaking
watercraft and yield the right of way.
   (h)   In rivers and streams or other areas in which there is a water
current, the descending watercraft shall have the right of way over a
watercraft which is ascending.
   (i)   When a powercraft and a row boat are proceeding in such direction as
to involve the risk of collision, such powercraft shall yield the right of way
to such row boat.
   (j)   Watercraft leaving a dock, boat slip, or tie-up space shall yield the
right of way to all watercraft approaching such dock, boat slip, or tie-up
space.
   (k)   At all times the operator of a watercraft shall maintain a proper
lookout required by the ordinary practice of seamen and by the special
circumstances of the case.
   (l)   In obeying and construing these rules, due regard shall be had to all
dangers of navigation and collision and to any special circumstances which may
render a departure from the above rules necessary in order to avoid immediate
danger.

mandatory jail term of three, ten or thirty consecutive days that the court is
required by subsection (d)(1), (2) or (3) of this section to impose. No court

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.

the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by

   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the

      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a

         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. (ORC
2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. (ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
 
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
 
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
 
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
 
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC

a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
“The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from the
witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
      A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
      B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
      C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
      D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

   (b)   The Chief of Police or his designee, upon finding that two or more
nuisance activities declared in this Section have occurred within any twelve
month period, may cause a written notice and order to be served on the owner of
the property declaring that such property is a nuisance property. The notice
and order shall set forth the nature of the nuisances, the estimated costs to
abate any future nuisance, and state that the owner may avoid being charged the
costs of abatement by taking steps to prevent any further nuisance activity as
set forth in this Section. The notice shall further state that if a third or
subsequent nuisance activity as declared in this Section occurs within twelve
months of the dates of the first two activities, the Village may abate the
nuisance by responding to the activities using administrative and law
enforcement actions, and the costs of such abatement shall be assessed on the
nuisance property.
   The notice shall be served on the owner(s) that are listed on the records of
the Lake County Auditor by delivering it personally to the owner or leaving it
at the owner’s usual place of business or residence, or by posting it in a

in Section
521.05(h) of the Codified Ordinances, and the costs shall be calculated as set
forth in subsection (e) of this Section. The Village shall provide notice to
the owner of the nuisance property of the Village’s intent to assess the costs
of abatement against the owner’s property at least thirty (30) days before such
costs are certified to the County for assessment against the property, and such
notice shall contain a description of the nuisance activity that is the basis
for the notice of intent to assess the property, and the cost to abate. Notice
shall be served as set forth above in subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   The owner of a nuisance property who receives a notice from the Chief
of Police or his designee pursuant to this Section may appeal such notice by
submitting a written request for reconsideration to the Chief of Police within
thirty (30) days of the date of the notice. If the Chief of Police finds that
the facts presented do not support the declaration of a nuisance, the Chief
shall rescind the notice. Otherwise the Chief shall deny the request and refer
the appeal for hearing by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Any such appeal shall
not stay any actions by the Village to abate the first or any subsequent
nuisance activity. In any such appeal, the Village must show by a preponderance
of the evidence that each violation stated in the notice being appealed has
occurred, and that the declaration of the property as a nuisance property or of
the intent of the Village to assess the property for abatement costs, whichever
is applicable, is justified. The Village shall be deemed to have failed to have
met this standard if the owner demonstrates by a preponderance of evidence
that:
      (1)   He or she was not the owner at the time of any of the nuisance
activity that is the basis of the notice; or
      (2)   He or she had knowledge of the nuisance activity, but has promptly
and vigorously taken all actions necessary to abate each nuisance including,
without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio Revised Code
Sections 5321.17(C) and 5321.04(A)(9), or
      (3)   He or she had no knowledge of the nuisance activity and could not,
with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance activity; and
upon receipt of the notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance
property, he or she promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance
including, without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio Revised
Code Sections 5321.17(C) and 5321.04(A)(9).
   (e)   Costs of abatement shall be assessed based upon the hourly wage of the
police officer or officers involved in the abatement of the nuisance activity,
plus 75%, multiplied by the number of hours required to abate the nuisance.
   (f)   The declaration of a nuisance property, an order to abate a nuisance,
or the assessment of costs by the Village on a property, do not affect or limit
the Village’s right or authority to bring criminal prosecution or other legal
action against any person for violation of the Village’s ordinances. (Ord.
2006-39. Passed 4-4-06.)
521.13  SPREADING CONTAGION.

reasonable measures to prevent exposing self to other persons, except when
seeking medical aid.

purpose;

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2909.11)

   (b)   (1)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause
or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that

      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

dangerous agency or substance.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of criminal damaging or

creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an

involved in the offense.

545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
 
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

R.C. 4503.22, a temporary motor vehicle license registration as prescribed by
Ohio R.C. 4503.182, or any comparable temporary motor vehicle license

concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the Village. The
provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a
limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials,
including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor
effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually

and/or a trade secret so as to remain confidential. In this event, the Village
shall seek to maintain the confidentiality of such maps and/or as-built plans;
provided, however, that such information is subject to applicable public
records laws and exceptions thereto. The Village shall provide a Service

Section
905.08 , as may be determined by the Village. (Ord. 2017-026. Passed 4-18-17.)

   (i)   Leased City. A Service Provider shall have the right, without prior
Village approval, to lease City or bandwidth to an unaffiliated Service
Provider, provided that when a lessee has physical access to the leased
Facilities:
      (1)   The Service Provider shall notify the Village of the lease
agreement within thirty (30) days of such lease agreement; and
      (2)   The lessee has complied, to the extent applicable, with the

   (j)   Assignments or Transfers of Consent. Consent to Occupy or Use the
Public Right-of-Way may be, directly or indirectly, transferred, assigned or
disposed of by sale, lease, merger, consolidation or other act of the Service

         B.   Any other information reasonably required by the Village.
   (k)   Transactions Affecting Control of Consent. Any transactions that

more of the ownership or ultimate working control of a Service Provider, of the
ownership or working control of the Service Provider's Facility, or of control
of the City or bandwidth of the Service Provider's System, Facilities or

apparent violation or noncompliance, providing a short and concise statement of
the nature and general facts of the violation or noncompliance, and providing
the Service Provider a reasonable period of time not exceeding thirty (30) days
to furnish evidence:
      (1)   That corrective action has been, or is being actively and
expeditiously pursued, to remedy the violation or noncompliance;
      (2)   That rebuts the alleged violation or noncompliance; and/or
      (3)   That it would be in the public interest to impose some penalty or
sanction less than revocation.
   (n)   Identification of Facilities. When the Village determines that
identification of Facilities is necessary to begin planning for Right-of-Way
improvement projects, Service Providers, upon receipt of notice by the Village,
are required to use reasonable efforts to field identify their Facilities. In
identifying Facilities, customary industry standards must be adhered to and
markings must identify the Service Provider responsible for the Facilities. All

Provider's name, logo and identification numbering or tracking. Advertising is
not permitted and all marking colors shall be those approved by the Village.
   (o)   Waiver of Requirements. It is within the Village Engineer's reasonable

requirements, in the Village Engineer's judgment, are not necessary or
appropriate to protect the Village's interests and the purposes and intent of
this Chapter.
 
   (p)   New or Additional Facilities When the Right-of-Way is Full. The
Village shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or
additional Facilities within the Public Right-of-Way if the Right-of-Way is
full. In making such decisions, the Village shall strive to the extent possible
to accommodate all existing and potential users of the Right-of-Way, but shall
be guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety and welfare,
the condition of the Right-of-Way, the time of year with respect to essential
Utilities, the protection of existing Facilities in the Right-of-Way, future
Village and County plans, if applicable, for public improvements, development
projects which have been determined to be in the public interest and
nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral treatment among Service Providers.
(Ord. 2017-026. Passed 4-18-17.)
905.05 LOCATION, RELOCATION AND REMOVAL OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   Location of Facilities. All Facilities shall be Constructed,
Reconstructed, installed and located in accordance with the following terms and
conditions:
      (1)   Facilities shall be installed within an existing compatible
underground duct or conduit whenever Excess City exists within such Facility.
      (2)   Unless application of this provision is specifically prohibited by
state or federal law, a Service Provider with permission to install Overhead
Facilities shall install its Facilities on pole attachments to existing utility
poles only, and then only if Surplus Space is available; and no pole located
within the Public Right-of-Way shall exceed fifty (50) feet in height unless
approved by Village Council ordinance.
      (3)   Whenever the existing electric, cable, telecommunications and other
similar Facilities are located underground in a certain area in a Public Right-
of-Way, a Service Provider with permission to Occupy the same Public Right-of-
Way with the electric, cable, telecommunications or other similar Facilities,
must also locate its Facilities underground to the extent technologically
feasible and economically practicable.
      (4)   Whenever a Service Provider is required to locate or relocate
Facilities underground in a certain area of the Right-of-Way, every Provider
with Facilities within the same certain area of the Right-of-Way shall
concurrently relocate their Facilities underground. This requirement may be
waived by the Village for good cause shown including consideration of such
factors as: the remaining economic life of the Facilities, public safety,
customer service needs, any Law precluding such undergrounding of the
Facilities, and hardship to the Provider, as determined by the Village
Engineer. If a Provider is denied a requested waiver from the above
requirements, the Provider may appeal the denial of the Village Engineer to the
Village Administrator as set forth in Section
905.99 (c).
      (5)   Except for Overhead Facilities as provided herein, no Facilities
shall be located above ground in a Public Right-of-Way without the express
written permission of the Village Engineer.
      (6)   The Village reserves the right to require a Service Provider to
provide Excess City in the Public Right-of-Way at the time of Construction,
Reconstruction, installation, location or relocation of Facilities.
   (b)   Excess City. To reduce Excavation in the Public Right-of-Way, it is
the Village's goal to encourage Service Providers to share occupancy of
underground conduit as well as to construct, whenever possible, excess conduit
City for occupancy of future Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way. Therefore,
if a Service Provider is constructing underground conduit in the Public Right-
of-Way for its own Facilities, and the Village reasonably determines such
construction is in an area in which other Service Providers would likely
construct Facilities in the future, the Village may require the Service
Provider to construct the conduit in the Public Right-of-Way with Excess City
in the Public Right-of-Way, provided the Service Provider shall be reimbursed
for the use of the Excess City by another Service Provider. The Service
Provider may charge a reasonable market lease rate for occupancy of the
additional conduit space as reimbursement.
   (c)   Village Owned Conduit.  If the Village owns or leases conduit in the
path of a Service Provider's proposed Facilities, and provided it is
technologically feasible for the Service Provider's Facilities to Occupy the
conduit owned or leased by the Village, the Service Provider shall be required
to Occupy the conduit owned or leased by the Village in order to reduce the
necessity to Excavate the Public Right-of-Way. The Service Provider shall pay
to the Village a Public Way Fee that is assessed pursuant to Section
905.08  for such Occupancy.
   (d)   Relocation or Removal of Facilities.  Within thirty (30) days
following written notice from the Village, a Service Provider shall, at its own
expense, temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the
position of any Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way whenever the Village
shall have determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration is
reasonably necessary for:
      (1)   The Construction, Reconstruction, repair, maintenance or
installation of any Village or other public improvement, in, upon, or near the
Public Right-of-Way;
      (2)   The operations of the Village or other governmental entity in or
upon the Public Right-of-Way;
      (3)   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the Public Rights of Way; or
      (4)   The sale, conveyance, vacation, or narrowing of all or any part of
the Public Right-of-Way. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Service Provider who
has Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way subject to a vacation or narrowing
that is not required for the purposes of the Village, shall have a permanent
easement in such vacated portion or excess portion in conformity with Ohio
Revised Code Section 723.041.
Notwithstanding the above, no Service Provider shall be required to bear the
expense of removal, relocation, change or alteration of position of any
Facilities if such requirement would be prohibited by law.
   (e)   Removal of Unauthorized Facilities. Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the Village, any Service Provider or other Person that
owns, controls or maintains any unauthorized System, Facility or related
appurtenances in the Public Right-of-Way shall, at its own expense, remove
those Facilities or appurtenances from the Public Right-of-Way of the Village
or shall arrange to sell the System, Facilities or appurtenances to the
Village. A System or Facility is unauthorized and subject to removal, following
notice, in the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon revocation of the Service Provider's consent to Occupy or Use
the Public Right-of-Way;
      (2)   If the System or Facility was Constructed, Reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained without the consent to do so, except
as otherwise provided by this Chapter;
      (3)   Upon abandonment of a Facility in the Public Right-of-Way, with the
exception of underground facilities abandoned in a manner authorized and
approved by the Village;
      (4)   If the System or Facility was Constructed, Reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any Excavation of a Public
Right-of-Way was performed, without prior issuance of a required Construction
Permit, except as otherwise provided by this Chapter;
      (5)   If the System or Facility was Constructed, Reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any Excavation of a Public
Right-of-Way was performed, at a location not permitted pursuant to the
Village's consent to Occupy or Use the Public Right-of-Way or Construction
Permit; or
      (6)   If the Service Provider fails to comply with the Registration
requirements of Section
905.03  of this Chapter.
   (f)   Failure to remove and/or relocate Facilities. If the Service Provider
fails to remove and/or relocate any of its Facilities within the thirty (30)
days period set forth in subsection (e) of this Section
905.05 , or receive an extension of time from the Village Engineer for
commencement and completion of removal or relocation, then, to the extent not
inconsistent with applicable law, the Village shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to do the following:
      (1)   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the Facilities
belong to the Village with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited
to, the right to connect and use the Facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the Facilities to another Person for operation; or
      (2)   Authorize removal of the Facilities installed by the Service
Provider in, on, over or under the Rights of Way of the Village at Service
Provider's cost and expense, by another Person; however, the Village shall have
no liability for any damage caused by such action and the Service Provider
shall be liable to the Village for all reasonable costs incurred by the Village
in such action; and
      (3)   To the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, any portion of
the Service Provider's Facilities in, on, over or under the Public Right-of-Way
of the Village designated by the Village for removal and not timely removed by
the Service Provider shall belong to and become the property of the Village,
without payment to the Service Provider, and the Service Provider shall execute
and deliver such documents, as the Village shall request, in form and substance
acceptable to the Village, to evidence such ownership by the Village.
   (g)   Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities. The Village retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any Facilities, or stop work on any
Construction, Reconstruction, installation, operation or Excavation, located in
the Public Right-of-Way of the Village, as the Village may determine to be
necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any need to protect the public
health, safety or welfare; except to the extent that the Village's actions
would cause a dangerous or potentially dangerous situation. (Ord. 2017-026.
Passed 4-18-17.)

Section
905.06 (c), or for Routine Maintenance as provided in Section

      (2)   For Routine Maintenance and New Service Orders that require the

913.03 SEWER RENTAL CHARGE; COMPUTATION AND RATE.
   For the purposes provided in Sections
913.01 and
913.07, there is levied a charge or rental to be paid by every person, firm or
corporation whose lots, lands and premises are served by a connection, directly
or indirectly, to the sanitary sewerage system, or otherwise discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either directly or
indirectly, into the Village sanitary sewage system, a charge or rental payable
and collectible as hereinafter provided and in an amount determinable as
follows:
   (a)   Except as herein provided, sewer charges or rentals shall be based
upon the water consumed on the premises served by a connection, directly or
indirectly, to the sanitary sewerage system, as measured by the Village water
meter or meters used thereon. In the event water used upon any such premises is
derived from a source other than or in addition to the Village water supply,
measurement or estimation thereof and a determination of the percentage of such
water which is self-produced or otherwise obtained and which is discharged into
the sanitary sewer system shall be made by the Village Engineer and shall be
the basis of computing the sewer rental charge. In case of a disagreement as to
the amount, the owner or other interested party may, at his own expense,
install and maintain a meter acceptable to the Board of Public Affairs for such
purpose.
      In the event that a premises is served both by the Village water supply
and a properly metered self-producer's supply, the rates or charges shall be
computed by combining the consumption of both sources of supply.
   (b)   In any case where industrial wastes or other liquids discharged into
the sanitary sewer system, either directly or indirectly, are not susceptible
to meter measurement, such wastes or other liquids shall be measured or
estimated in such manner as the Village Engineer shall determine in order to
establish the sewer rental or charges therefor, except that rain water
discharge directly or indirectly from roofs into the sanitary sewerage system
shall be charged for in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d)
hereof.
   (c)   Sewer charges or rentals shall be twenty-five percent (25%) of the
gross bill charged by the Village for water passing through a Village water
meter; or in respect to premises being supplied from sources other than or in
addition to the municipal water system, twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount
which would have been charged for water consumed and discharged in the sanitary
sewage system, measured as herein provided; if such water had been supplied by
the Village. In no event shall sewer charges or rentals be less than twenty-
five percent (25%) of the monthly minimum water rental as now or hereafter
charged by the Village.
      (Ord. 1984-14. Passed 1-16-84.)
   (d)   No person shall permit roof water to be discharged into the sanitary
sewer system of the Village directly or indirectly from any residence,
commercial, industrial, public or semipublic building or any roof whatsoever.
      (Ord. 73-52. Passed 5-7-73.)
   (e)   In the event that water supplied from the Village water system to
large consumers is used for such purposes that it will not be returned to the
sanitary sewerage system, that portion not returned shall be exempt from the
sewer charges or rentals, provided the user, at his own expense, furnishes,
installs and maintains suitable metering devices acceptable to the Village
Water Department for the determination of the same.
      (Ord. 2285. Passed 6-2-53.)
913.04 METHOD OF BILLING AND PAYMENT.
   The charge or rental provided in this chapter shall be payable quarterly at
the office of the Water Department in the Village Hall and shall be billed
jointly and combined with the charges for water, except as provided in Section
913.03(d). The charge shall cover the same period as the water bill in the
distribution in which the property is located. In the event a sewer user does
not obtain his water from the Village, he shall be billed separately and at the
same time and for the same period as water bills are rendered in the district
in which the property is located.
   For any lot, parcel of land, building or premises now discharging sanitary
sewerage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the Village's sewerage
system, either directly or indirectly, the sewer charge or rental shall begin
with the first full quarterly period in the district the property is located.
(Ord. 2285. Passed 6-2-53.)
913.05 DELINQUENT WATER OR SEWER RENTAL CHARGE; SERVICE DISCONTINUANCE.
   The Board of Public Affairs is authorized to collect the sewer charges or
rentals. No user of the Village water service may pay a quarterly sewer charge
unless he also pays his water bill for the same period, and no user of Village
sewer service may pay a quarterly water charge unless he also pays his sewer
service bill for the same period. When the water or sewer service bill for the
premises for which the water and sewer charges, or either of them, become
delinquent, service may be discontinued until the delinquent bill has been
paid.
(Ord. 2285. Passed 6-2-53.)
913.06 CHARGES A LIEN; COLLECTION BY ASSESSMENT.
   Each sewer charge or rental under or pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter is made a lien upon the corresponding lot, parcel of land, building or
premises served by a connection, either directly or indirectly, to the sewerage
system of the Village. If the charge is not paid when due and payable, it shall
be certified to the Auditor of Lake County, who shall place the same on the tax
duplicate as a tax lien or assessment against such lot or parcel of land, with
interest and penalties allowed by law, and shall be collected in the same
manner and at the same time as other taxes are collected. (Ord. 2285. Passed 6-
2-53.)
913.07 USE OF FUNDS.
   The funds received from the collection of the charges or rentals authorized
by this chapter shall be deposited weekly with the Village Treasurer and shall
be accounted for and be known as the Sewer Rental Fund. When appropriated by
Council, the fund shall be available for the purposes provided in Ohio R.C.
729.52.
913.99 PENALTY.

storm water from either their buildings or premises to enter the sanitary sewer
on or along any street abutting their property. Foundation drains on any new
construction shall not be permitted to drain into the sanitary sewer system.
(Ord. 90-37. Passed 4-10-90.)
915.02 NUISANCE TO BE ABATED.
   All "storm sewers" including all pipes and other conduits now used to convey
storm water into sanitary sewers in any street are declared to be a public
nuisance and are ordered abated.
(Ord. 90-37. Passed 4-10-90.)
915.03 STORM DRAINAGE CONNECTIONS PROHIBITED.
   No person owning or occupying property abutting upon any street, land,

drainage purposes.
(Ord. 90-37. Passed 4-10-90.)
915.04 DISCONNECTION OF ROOF DRAINS FROM GROUND PIPES.
   It is determined and declared that all downspouts from buildings or
structures which discharge below the surface of the ground are public nuisances
unless and until it is determined that the water discharging from such
downspouts does in fact discharge into a storm sewer located in the public way.
The Director of Utilities and Public Services and his duly authorized agents
are directed to commence a Village-wide survey of all roof and gutter
downspouts within the Village that discharge into underground receptacles and,
in the event it cannot be determined that the storm water discharging into the
ground receptacles and piping, is in fact flowing into the public storm sewer
system, such Director is authorized to give notice to the landowner and/or
occupant upon which any such downspout is located to sever such downspout from
the receptacle and piping located in the ground. Upon severing of such
downspout, the receptacle and/or piping shall be securely capped so as to
prohibit the flow of any surface water into such area and the downspout shall
be caused to discharge into a splash block, such splash block and its placement
to be approved by the Director or his duly authorized agent and such splash
block shall have a minimum of thirty-six inches in length and twelve inches in
width placed immediately below the downspout outlet. The downspout outlets
shall be angled to direct flow away from the structure and shall be no closer
to a finished lawn than six inches. Upon notice to disconnect a downspout as
herein provided, the landowner and/or occupant shall have a period of thirty
days after receipt of notice to provide for the severing of the downspout and
the flow of the storm water into a splash block.

is located, no transfer of such real estate shall be effective unless and until
a zoning certificate is issued to the prospective new owner of the real estate.
No such zoning certificate shall be issued to the new owner unless and until
the seller of the property shall have produced evidence, satisfactory to the
Director of Utilities and Public Service, that the sewer piping on such
property from building to right of way is in good condition, properly connected

and performs tests necessary in order to provide the evidence required by this
section, there shall be a fee of thirty dollars ($30.00) per hour charged for
performance of such tests. No person, agent, firm or corporation shall sell any
interest in any land containing an existing building or structure without
furnishing the buyer, prior to the sale, proof that the sewer piping on the
property from building or structure to right of way is in good condition,
properly connected and reasonably free from infiltration, and, in the event
there is an escrow established to provide for the delivery of instruments,
documents and funds in connection with the sale, the seller shall deposit in
escrow, prior to delivery of possession or transfer of title, the written
statement from the buyer acknowledging receipt of a statement from the Director
of Utilities and Public Services confirming that the sewer piping on the
property from the building to the right of way is in good condition, properly
connected and reasonably free from infiltration.

   If the number of parking spaces required in Section
1125.05.05 is substantially larger than the number anticipated by the applicant
and/or the project is to be built in phases, and the applicant provides
sufficient evidence to the Zoning Inspector that supports the reduced parking
needs, a site plan may be approved with a lesser number of parking spaces
provided:
   (a)   That the total number of spaces initially provided shall not be less
than seventy percent (70%) of the spaces required under Section
1125.05.05.

1125.05.07 LOCATION OF PARKING SPACES.
   (a)   All parking spaces as required under this Section shall be located on
the same lot or parcel as the building or use being served, unless one of the
following conditions is present:
      (1)   An increase in the number of spaces is required by a change of use
or enlargement of use where such spaces are provided collectively or used
jointly by two or more buildings or establishments, the required spaces may be
located not more than three hundred (300) feet from an institutional building
served and not more than five hundred (500) feet from any other non-residential
building being served, provided however, that such spaces have reasonable and
safe access to the building being served.
      (2)   The existing building takes up a majority of the parcel of land and
parking cannot be reasonably located on the lot.
         A.   The property owner or business may use on-street parking as part
of the number of parking spaces that are provided so long as the on-street
parking is within 500 feet of the building and not claimed by another use. Half
of the required parking spaces shall be in an off-street parking area. If the
lot meets the criteria in subsection (a)(2) hereof, then property owner or
business may use all off-street parking to meet their minimum number of spaces.
         B.   The property owner may lease off-street parking spaces from
another property owner and count them as part of the number of parking spaces

      (Ord. 1998-119. Passed 10-20-98.)
1126.02 APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY PLOT PLAN; FINISHED GROUND GRADE AND GRADE OF
FOUNDATION.
   (a)    Upon receipt of the application and plot plan, as described in
Section
1126.01, the Village Zoning Inspector shall, if all other aspects of the
application for the permit are in order, submit a copy of the application and
plot plan to the Village Engineer. The Engineer shall examine such plot plan
for conformity to the proper relation with existing or proposed sanitary
sewers, water lines, storm drainage and existing grades of adjacent lands and
buildings, following the guidelines of subsection (b) hereof. If the plan does
not so conform, the Engineer shall call the applicant's attention to the lack
of conformity and require that the plan be changed in that respect. Once the
Village Engineer finds that the plan conforms to the within Codified Ordinance,
it shall be approved. Such approved plan shall be a condition of any permit
which may be issued pursuant to this Chapter for such construction. It shall
then be the responsibility of the applicant to perform all work in conformity
with the various grades and elevations of the final approved plot plan and to
set witness markers clearly designating the lot corners.
 
   (b)    The finished ground grade of a building shall be established in
proper relation to the surrounding grade, driveway and street. The parcel of
land or lot shall be graded so that water drains away from each building at a
minimum grade of two percent. Surface drainage swales shall have a minimum
grade of .5 percent designed so that surface water will drain onto a swale,
street gutter, storm sewer, drain inlet or natural drainage way. The grades of
driveways shall be a minimum of .4 percent and a maximum of fifteen percent.
Grading shall be adjusted so there will be no abrupt grades in the front yards
and along side lot lines. The grades of earth terraces shall not exceed three
to one. If a masonry retaining wall exceeds three feet in height, a hedge,
fence or railing shall be provided.
 
   (c)    At such time as the permit holder has constructed the foundation or
slab referred to in Section
1126.01(h), he or she shall request that the Village Engineer check the grade.
No further construction shall be permitted until the Engineer has checked the
elevation of such foundation and found it be in accordance with the plot plan
approved pursuant to subsection (a) hereof.
 
   (d)    At appropriate times, the Village Engineer may inspect the progress
of the site work. The permit holder shall be notified of any deficiencies
discovered during such inspection, and he or she shall repair such deficiency
within the time frame acceptable to the Village Engineer.
 
   (e)    Upon completion of construction and before a certificate of occupancy
is issued for a building by the County Building Inspection Department, the
permit holder shall schedule, with the Village Engineer, a pre-final inspection
of the site work completed at that time. As soon as weather conditions allow
for an adequate inspection, the Village Engineer shall inspect the site work.
Any deficiency observed during such inspection shall be brought to the
attention of the permit holder who shall correct such deficiency within a time
frame acceptable to the Village Engineer. The Village Engineer shall bring to
the permit holder's attention any change or addition to the site work which is
to be incorporated into the final plot plan.
(Ord. 1998-119. Passed 10-20-98.)
1126.03 FINAL PLOT PLAN.
   Upon completion of the final grading and seeding of the site, the permit
holder shall file with the Village Engineer a final plot plan, which shall show
the final grades of the improvement as constructed. Such plan shall be
certified, by a registered civil engineer or surveyor, as to the accuracy of
the plan in depicting the actual construction. Such civil engineer or surveyor
shall also certify that he or she has made an actual field observation of as-
built conditions and that such conditions are as shown on the plan. The form of
such certification shall be prescribed by the Village Engineer. (Ord. 1998-119.
Passed 10-20-98.)
1126.04  DEPOSIT, COSTS AND FEES.
   (a)    The Fiscal Officer or Zoning Inspector shall collect a five hundred
dollar ($500.00) deposit at the time of application for a permit. The Village
Engineer shall estimate the cost of the grade plan review. If the estimated
cost exceeds the five hundred dollar ($500.00) deposit, the applicant shall be
informed of the estimated cost and shall be directed to deposit the difference
between the Engineer's estimate and the applicant's original five hundred
dollar ($500.00) deposit, which difference shall be deposited prior to the
Engineer's examination of the plot plan.
 
   (b)    The applicant shall be charged for the actual costs incurred by the
Village Engineer for reviewing the plot plan, issuing the permit, inspecting
the site and setting the grade, and any and all other expenses associated with
the issuance of the permit. Such costs shall be computed on the basis and in
accordance with the legislation governing the right of compensation for the
Village Engineer at the time. Any deficiency between the actual costs of the
services rendered by the Village Engineer and the deposit paid by the applicant
shall be paid to the Village prior to the approval of the final plot plan. Any
excess of the deposit over the actual costs of the Village Engineer and the
permit fee shall be returned to the applicant.
 
   (c)    All costs and fees paid pursuant to this Chapter shall be deposited
in the General Fund of the Village.

            (Ord. 2017-033. Passed 3-7-17.)
1127.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization).
   The approved SWP3, and the sediment and erosion controls, and non-sediment
pollution controls contained therein, shall be implemented upon the
commencement of construction. Perimeter controls must be installed two working
days prior to commencement of construction. The approved plan must be
implemented until the site reaches final stabilization. All properties adjacent
to the site of soil-disturbing activity shall be protected from soil erosion
and sediment run-off and damage, including, but not limited to, private
properties, natural and artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers and public
lands.
   It is the owner's responsibility to maintain current records of contractor
(s) responsible for implementation the SWP3 and providing that information to
[community engineer or administrator of code]. The SWP3 shall identify all
subcontractors engaged in activities that could impact stormwater runoff. The
SWP3 shall contain signatures from all of the identified subcontractors
indicating that they have been informed and understand their roles and
responsibilities in complying with the SWP3. The applicant shall review the
SWP3 with the primary contractor prior to commencement of construction
activities and keep a SWP3 training log to demonstrate that this review had
occurred.
   Erosion and sediment controls shall be designed, installed and maintained
effectively to minimize the discharge of pollutants during the course of earth
disturbing activities. The controls shall include the following minimum
components:
   (a)    NON-STRUCTURAL PRESERVATION MEASURES: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
minimizing disturbance of steep slopes, designation of tree preservation areas
or other protective clearing or grubbing practices. Soil compaction shall be
minimized and, unless infeasible, topsoil shall be preserved. Provide and
maintain a 50-foot buffer of undisturbed natural vegetation around surface
waters of the state, or riparian or wetland setbacks, if applicable, whichever
is greater, unless maintaining this buffer is infeasible (e.g., stream
crossings for roads or utilities, or for channel and floodplain rehabilitation
and restoration). Direct stormwater to vegetated areas to increase sediment
removal and maximize stormwater infiltration.
   (b)    EROSION CONTROL PRACTICES: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. The amount of soil
exposed during construction activity shall be minimized. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
      Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.

Disturbed areas that     Prior to November 1 or the onset of winter weather,
will be idle over winter whichever occurs first.
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed.
      (2)    Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels. Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www .nrcs. usda. gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)    RUNOFF CONTROL PRACTICES. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff within the site to prevent
erosion. Peak flow rates and total stormwater volume shall be controlled to
minimize erosion and outlets, downstream channel and streambank erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge
locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive
flow velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural physical
and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected.
   (d)    SEDIMENT CONTROL PRACTICES. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas to minimize sediment discharges from
the site. Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days. Such practices
may include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain
inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to
a sediment settling pond. The design, installation and maintenance of erosion
and sediment controls shall address factors such as the amount, frequency,
intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of resulting stormwater
runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of soil particle sizes
expected to be present on the site.
   (e)    All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are
not considered a sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a
sediment settling pond.
      Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)    Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
best management practice upon approval from the Village of Fairport Harbor
Engineer and/or the Lake County SWCD, is required for any one of the following
conditions:
         A.    Concentrated storm water runoff.
         B.    Runoff from drainage areas which exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence (see Table 3)- inlet protection, or other sediment barriers;
         C.    Runoff from common drainage locations with 10 or more acres of
disturbed land;
Sediment settling ponds shall be provided in the form of a sediment trap or
sediment basin as defined in the latest edition of Rainwater and Land
Development. The maximum allowable contributing drainage area to a sediment
trap shall be limited to less than 5 acres. Contributing-drainage areas of 5
acres or more shall be treated with a sediment basin. An equivalent best-
management practice may be utilized upon approval from the Village of Fairport
Harbor.
The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage zone and a
dewatering zone. The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least 1,800
cubic feet of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area. The
dewatering structure of sediment basins shall be designed to have a minimum 48-
hour drain time, and, unless infeasible, be designed to always withdraw runoff
from the surface of the pond throughout the storm cycle. As such, a skimmer
discharge device consistent with Rainwater and Land Development shall be
provided to dewater sediment basins. Sediment traps shall also provide both a
sediment storage zone and dewatering zone, but the outlet structure shall be
constructed consistent with the specifications contained in the latest edition
of Rainwater and Land Development.
When post-construction detention/water quality ponds are to be used as
temporary sediment trapping BMPs, a skimmer discharge device consistent with
Rainwater and Land Development shall be utilized during construction phase and
until the site is deemed permanently stabilized by the Village of Fairport
Harbor.
The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirements of sediment
basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of the pond
provides an equivalent or better sediment storage zone and dewatering zone. As
such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall be no
discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage zone
and the discharge of storm water within the dewatering zone shall only occur
through the skimmer.
The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one of the
following methods:
Method 1: The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1000ft3 per
disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
Method 2: The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the volume necessary
to store the sediment as calculated with RUSLE or other generally accepted
erosion prediction model.
When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas
which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless
runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is
not comingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the dewatering zone must
be less than or equal to five (5) feet. The configuration between the inlets
and the outlet of the sediment-settling pond must provide at least two units of
length for each one unit of width > 2:1 length-to-width ratio; however, a
length to width ratio of > 4:1 is recommended. Sediment must be removed from
the sediment settling pond when the design capacity of the sediment storage
zone has been completely filled by sediment accumulations. This limit is
typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin depth. When
designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider public safety,
especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the sediment basin
and alternative sediment controls must be used where site limitations would
preclude a safe design. The use of a combination of sediment and erosion
control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is encouraged.
      (3)    Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent properties
and water resources from sediment transported via sheet flow. Where intended to
provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on a level contour and
shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The relationship between the
maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is shown in
Table 3 below. Placing silt fence in a parallel series does not extend the size
of the permissible drainage area.
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence Based on Slope
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 linear feet of silt Range of slope for
fence                                                    a drainage area (%)
0.5                                                      <2%
0.25                                                     > 2% < 20%
0.125                                                    > 20% but < 50%
 
      (4)    Alternative perimeter controls for sheet flow discharges may be
considered by the Village of Fairport Harbor, but their use shall not exceed
the limitations indicated in Table 3 above. Detail drawings and plan notes
shall specify the diameter of filter socks, compost berms and other such
alternative perimeter controls if used instead of silt fence.
      (5)    Stormwater diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away
from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices, which include swales,
dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to 10 acres.
      (6)    Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. All inlets receiving runoff from drainage
areas of one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond. Straw or hay
bales and filter socks around catch basins are not acceptable forms of inlet
protection.
      (7)    Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control. Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.    Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the
only permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These
entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled
concrete or cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile
fabric, and constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent
edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.    Streets and catch basins adjacent to construction entrances
shall be kept free of sediment tracked off site. Streets directly adjacent to
construction entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall
be cleaned daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch
basins on these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall also be
cleaned weekly and protected from sediment-laden runoff, if feasible without
posing a public safety hazard.
Based on site conditions, Village of Fairport Harbor Engineer and/or the Lake
County SWCD may require additional best management practices to control off
site tracking and dust. These additional BMPs may include:
         C.    Fencing shall be installed around the perimeter of the
development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to designated
construction entrances.
         D.    Designated vehicle and wheel-washing areas. Wash water from
these areas must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment
settling pond, or to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
1127.09 (g) of this regulation. No surfactants or detergents may be used to
wash vehicles.
         E.    Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The Village of Fairport Harbor Engineer
and/or the Lake County SWCD may require dust controls including the use of
water trucks to wet disturbed areas, tarping stockpiles, temporary
stabilization of disturbed areas, and regulation of the speed of vehicles on
the site.
      (8)    Surface Waters of the State protection. Construction vehicles
shall avoid water resources. A 50 foot undisturbed natural buffer shall be
provided around surface waters of the state unless infeasible. If it is
infeasible to provide and maintain an undisturbed 50-foot natural buffer, the
SWP3 shall comply with the stabilization requirements in
1127.09(b)(1) for areas within 50 feet of a surface water or riparian or
wetland setback if applicable, whichever is greater; and minimize soil
compaction and, unless infeasible, preserve topsoil. [Communities with riparian
and/or wetland setbacks include the following language: If a riparian or
wetland setback is greater than 50 feet, no disturbance of natural vegetation
shall occur within the riparian or wetland setback unless a variance to the
riparian or wetland setback regulation has been granted]. If the applicant is
permitted to disturb areas within 50 feet of a water resource, the following
conditions shall be addressed in the SWP3:
         A.    All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.    Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.    No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in water resources
or wetlands.
         D.    Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.    Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.    Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control
structures shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or
close to the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough,
slip, or erode.
         G.    Concentrated stormwater runoff from BMPs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measure before the runoff enters the wetlands. The flow should
be released such that no erosion occurs downslope. Level spreaders may need to
be placed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities.
         H.    Protected areas or critical areas, including wetlands and
riparian areas shall be physically marked in the field prior to earth
disturbing activities.
      (9)    Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (f)    NON-SEDIMENT POLLUTANT CONTROLS: No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources, wetlands or
the MS4. These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Waste Materials: A covered dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, other public facility, natural resource or water of the
state is prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made
available.
      (3)   Disposal of Other Wastewaters: The discharge of washout and
cleanout of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds, and other
construction materials to a street, catch basin, other public facility, natural
resource or waters of the state is prohibited. The discharge of soaps or
solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing is also prohibited. If
generated, these wastewaters must be collected and disposed of properly.
      (4)   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage:  All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of the largest
containers in the storage area and/or a spill kit shall be provided to clean up
spills. The SWP3 shall contain spill prevention and response procedures and
these procedures shall be discussed at the pre-construction meeting.
      (5)   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly. The discharge of fuels, oils, and other
pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance is
prohibited.
      (6)   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Discovery of previously
unknown contaminated soils onsite shall be self-reported to Ohio EPA and local
authorities. Contaminated soils from redevelopment sites shall be disposed of
properly. Runoff from contaminated soils shall not be discharged from the site.
Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid waste
landfill sites or redevelopment sites. Where construction activities are to
occur on sites with contamination from previous activities, operators shall be
aware that concentrations of materials that meet other criteria (i.e. not
considered a Hazardous Waste, meeting Voluntary Action Program (VAP standards))
may still result in storm water discharges in excess of Ohio Water Quality
Standards. Such discharges are not authorized by this code. Control measures
which may be utilized to meet this requirement include, but are not limited to:
         A.   Use berms, trenches, pits or tanks to collect contaminated runoff
and prevent discharge.
         B.   Pump runoff from contaminated soils to the sanitary sewer with
the prior approval of the sanitary sewer system operator, or pump into a
container for transport to an appropriate treatment or disposal facility; and
         C.   Cover areas of contamination with tarps, daily cover or other
such methods to prevent storm water from coming into contact with contaminated
materials.
The SWP3 must include methods to minimize the exposure of building materials,
building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste to
precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt. The SWP3 shall include
measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and leaks. Applicants may
also reference the existence of other plans (i.e., Spill Prevention Control and
Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs, Safety Response Plans,
etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement and a copy of such
plan is maintained on site.
   (g)    COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (h)    TRENCH AND GROUND WATER CONTROL. There shall be no sediment- laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (i)    INTERNAL INSPECTIONS.
      (1)   All controls on the site shall be inspected at least once every
seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-
half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The inspection frequency may be reduced
to at least once every month if the entire site is temporarily stabilized or
runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g., site is covered with snow,
ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of inspection requirements is available
until one month before thawing conditions are expected to result in a discharge
if prior written approval has been attained from the Village of Fairport Harbor
Engineer and/or the Lake County SWCD and all of the following conditions are
met:
         A.    The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one (1)
month).
         B.    Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
         C.    The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
         D.    For sites that will not be completed by October 1, a Pre-Winter
Stabilization Meeting shall be held by the landowner and the developer,
engineer and contractor of the project and the Village of Fairport Harbor prior
to October 1, in order to plan and approve winter erosion and sediment controls
as defined in the most current online edition of Rainwater and Land
Development.
      (2)   The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to
conduct these inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional
and to evaluate whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control
measures are required. Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with
knowledge and experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and
erosion controls. Certified inspection reports shall be submitted to the
Fairport Harbor engineer within seven (7) working days from the inspection and
retained at the development site.
      (3)   These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
         A.   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
         B.   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3
shall be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The applicant
shall utilize an inspection form provided by the Village of Fairport Harbor or
an alternate form acceptable to the Village of Fairport Harbor Engineer. The
inspection form shall include:
            1.   The inspection date.
            2.   Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
            3.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
            4.   Weather information and a description of any discharges
occurring at the time of inspection.
            5.   Locations of:
               a.   Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
               b.   BMPs that need to be maintained.
               c.   BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved
inadequate for a particular location.
               d.   Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
            6.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to
the SWP3 and implementation dates.
         C.   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether
erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
         D.   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be
inspected for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
         E.   The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
non-compliance determined by these inspections.
   (j)    MAINTENANCE. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All BMPs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure
continued performance of their intended function until final stabilization. All
sediment control practices must be maintained in a functional condition until
all up slope areas they control reach final stabilization. The applicant shall
provide a description of maintenance procedures needed to ensure the continued
performance of control practices and shall ensure a responsible party and
adequate funding to conduct this maintenance, all as determined by the Village
of Fairport Harbor Engineer.
When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of
erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   When BMPs require repair or maintenance. If an internal inspection
reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the exception of a
sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within three (3) days
of the inspection. Sediment-settling ponds must be repaired or maintained
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)    When BMPs fail to provide their intended function. If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function as
detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be
installed within three (3) to ten (10) days of the inspection as determined by
the community engineer or site inspector.
      (3)    When BMPs depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in accordance with the
schedule, the control practice must be implemented within ten (10) days from
the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection reveals that the planned
control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of
explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
   (k)   FINAL STABILIZATION. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
Village of Fairport Harbor Engineer. Once a definable area has achieved final
stabilization, the applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further
inspection requirement applies to that portion of the site. Final stabilization
also requires the installation of permanent (post-construction) stormwater
control measures (SCMs). Obligations under this chapter, shall not be completed
until installation of post-construction BMPs is verified.
      (Ord. 2017-033. Passed 3-7-17.)
1127.10 ABBREVIATED EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL PLAN(SWP3).
   (a)   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the
applicant shall submit an Abbreviated SWP3 in accordance with the requirements
of this regulation.
   (b)   The Abbreviated SWP3 shall be certified by a professional engineer, a
registered surveyor, certified professional erosion and sediment control
specialist, or a registered landscape architect.
   (c)   The Abbreviated SWP3 shall include a minimum of the following BMPs.
Village of Fairport Harbor may require other BMPs as site conditions warrant.
      (1)   Construction Entrances: Construction entrances shall be built and
shall serve as the only permitted points of ingress and egress to the
development area. These entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of
aggregate stone or recycled concrete or cement sized greater than 2" in
diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and constructed in conformance with
specifications in the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
      (2)    Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a

Disturbed areas that will be idle over Prior to November 1
winter
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization
techniques must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion
matting.
 
      (5)    Inlet Protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems, including rear yard inlets. Straw, hay
bales, and filter socks are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (6)    Silt Fence and Other Perimeter Controls. Silt fence and other
perimeter controls approved by the Village of Fairport Harbor shall be used to
protect adjacent properties and water resources from sediment discharged via
sheet (diffused) flow. Silt fence shall be placed along level contours and the
permissible drainage area is limited to those indicated in Table 3 in
1127.09 of these regulations.
      (7)    Internal Inspection and Maintenance. All controls on the
development area shall be inspected at least once every seven calendar days and
within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24
hour period. Maintenance shall occur as detailed below:
         A.    When BMPs require repair or maintenance. If the internal
inspection reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         B.    When BMPs fail to provide their intended function. If the
internal inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function
and that another, more appropriate control practice is required, the
Abbreviated SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be installed
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         C.    When BMPs depicted on the Abbreviated SWP3 are not installed. If
the internal inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection. If the inspection reveals that
the planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement
of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
      (8)    Final Stabilization: Final stabilization shall be determined by
the Village of Fairport Harbor Engineer. (Ord. 2017-033. Passed 3-7-17.)
1127.11 FEES.

under this regulation.
   (b)    Upon notice, the Mayor, the Village Administrator and/or designee may
suspend any active soil disturbing activity for a period not to exceed ninety
(90) days, and may require immediate erosion and sediment control measures
whenever he or she determines that such activity is not meeting the intent of
this regulation. Such notice shall be in writing, shall be given to the
applicant, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. In
instances, however, where the Mayor, the Village Administrator and/or designee
finds that immediate action is necessary for public safety or the public
interest, he or she may require that work be stopped upon verbal order pending
issuance of the written notice.
(Ord. 2017-033. Passed 3-7-17.)
1127.15 APPEALS.
   Any person aggrieved by any order, requirement, determination, or any other

1128.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable stormwater management standards to achieve a level
of stormwater quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the Village of Fairport Harbor:
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the Village of Fairport Harbor to:
      (1)   Control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all
Stormwater Control Measures (SCMs) are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and groundwater are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the Village of Fairport
Harbor's future expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream
crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section
1128.01.
 
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Lake County, and the
Village of Fairport Harbor shall comply with this regulation for roadway
projects initiated after March 10, 2006 and, to the maximum extent practicable,
for projects initiated before that time.
 
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
 
   (f)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface as
determined by the Village of Fairport Harbor engineer. Such projects must be
designed to minimize the number of stream crossings and the width of
disturbance. Linear construction projects must comply with the requirements of
Chapter
1128 Erosion and Sediment Control.

(Ord. 2017-025. Passed 2-21-17.)
1128.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General:  The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources.
The SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the physical, biological, and chemical integrity
of the water resources receiving stormwater discharges from the site.
Acceptable practices shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project and complies with Chapter 1286 of the
Village of Fairport Harbor's riparian setback ordinance requirements.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows in accordance
with the requirements of this Chapter of the Code.
   SCMs that meet the criteria in this regulation, and additional criteria
required by the Village of Fairport Harbor engineer, shall comply with this
regulation.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use:  SCMs shall be designed to
achieve the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be
compatible with the proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine
maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Part Twelve, Title Two, Chapters 1220 to 1230
Village of Fairport Harbor subdivision code, shall provide stormwater
management and water quality controls for the development of all subdivided
lots. This shall include provisions for lot grading and drainage that prevent
structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm; and maintain, to the
extent practicable, the pre-development runoff patterns, volumes, and peaks
from each lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources: SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as
required in Section
1128.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1127 Village of Fairport Harbor's erosion and sediment control requirements and
the Lake County standards for riparian setback requirements unless the Village
determines that a modified setback is required, all as determined by the
Village Engineer.
      (5)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels: All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption: The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
1128.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Village of Fairport
Harbor engineer that the site is part of a larger common plan of development
where the stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by an
existing SCMs, or if the stormwater management requirements for the site are
provided by practices defined in a regional or local stormwater management plan
approved by the Village of Fairport Harbor engineer.
      (7)   Maintenance: All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements approved by the Village of
Fairport Harbor engineer as detailed in Section
1128.08.
      (8)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the Village of Fairport
Harbor, SCMs serving multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot
held and maintained by an entity of common ownership or, if compensated by the
property owners, by the Village of Fairport Harbor. SCMs serving single lots
shall be placed on these lots, protected within an easement, and maintained by
the property owner.
      (9)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage: Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and
grubbing practices; and maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and
through these areas. Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide
perpetual management of runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving
stream's physical, chemical and biological characteristics are protected and
ecological functions are maintained.
      (10)   Preservation of Wetland Hydrology: Concentrated stormwater runoff
from SCMs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters the wetlands in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and
wetland flora. The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope. Practices such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration
basins, conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent
streams, depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the
wetland hydrology.
If the applicant proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a hydrological
analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the proposed discharge matches
the pre-development hydroperiods and hydrodynamics that support the wetland.
   
   (b)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria: All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Surface water protection: The Village of Fairport Harbor engineer
may allow modification to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface
waters only if the applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate
permits from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal,
state, and local agencies as required in Section
1128.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1127 Village of Fairport Harbor's erosion and sediment control requirements and
the Lake County standards for riparian setback requirements unless the Village
determines that a modified setback is required, all as determined by the
Village of Fairport Harbor engineer. At a minimum, stream relocation designs
must show how the project will minimize changes to the vertical stability,
floodplain form, channel form, and habitat of upstream and downstream channels
on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges:  Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Village of Fairport Harbor
engineer that off-site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the
development site in a manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream
flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow: The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other SCMs from areas too long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as
determined by the Village of Fairport Harbor engineer.
      (4)   Open channels: Unless otherwise allowed by the Village of Fairport
Harbor engineer, drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open
channel with vegetated banks and designed to carry the 10 year, 24 hour
stormwater runoff from upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under Village of Fairport Harbor zoning or where the use of an open
drainage system affects public health or safety, all as determined by the
Village of Fairport Harbor engineer. The following criteria shall be used to
design storm sewer systems when necessary:
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5 year, 24 hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10 year, 24 hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributing drainage area within the
proposed development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream
from the development.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the Village of Fairport Harbor engineer.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the Village of Fairport
Harbor:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25 year, 24 hour storm.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
(25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of box culverts
and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or
conveyance must to be sized to carry the 25-year storm under these conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100 year,
24 hour storm, or the 100 year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding:  Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100 year, 24 hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the finished grade
elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance cap Village of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the Village of Fairport
Harbor must be compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume. First
consideration for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be
given to areas where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new
floodplain within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also
be given to enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for
floodplain fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing
watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by the Village of Fairport Harbor,
reductions in volume due to floodplain fills must be mitigated within the legal
boundaries of the development. Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage
areas must reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed
area. The use of vertical retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
NOTE: The subsection(b)(8) above should be coordinated with the Lake County
standards for riparian setback requirements. The requirement for compensatory
floodplain storage is only in effect when the riparian setback does not include
the entire 100-year floodplain, when the Village of Fairport Harbor grants a
variance that allows filling in the floodplain due to site constraints, or when
the Village of Fairport Harbor Engineer determines that stream or floodplain
restoration is needed to meet the objectives of this regulation.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control:  
      (1)   Direct runoff to an SCM: The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more of the following SCMs. These practices are listed in
Table 2 of this regulation and shall be designed to meet the following general
performance standards:
         A.   Extended detention facilities that detain stormwater; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled stormwater to a water
resource.
         B.   Infiltration facilities that retain stormwater; promote settling,
filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured stormwater
into the ground. The Village of Fairport Harbor engineer may require a soil
engineering report to be prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed
infiltration facilities meet these performance standards.
For sites less than five (5) acres, but required to create a comprehensive
stormwater management plan, the Village of Fairport Harbor engineer may approve
other SCMs if the applicant demonstrates to the Village of Fairport Harbor
engineer's satisfaction that these SCMs meet the objectives of this regulation
as stated in Section
1128.09(c)(6).
         C.   For sites greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5)
acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will
disturb five (5) or more acres, the Village of Fairport Harbor engineer may
approve other SCMs if the applicant demonstrates to the Village of Fairport
Harbor engineer's satisfaction that these SCMs meet the objectives of this
regulation as stated in Section
1128.09(c)(6), and has prior written approval from the Ohio EPA.
         D.   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by public entities (i.e. the state, counties, townships, cities, or
villages), the Village of Fairport Harbor engineer may approve SCMs not
included in Table 2 of this regulation, but must show compliance with the
current version of the Ohio Department of Transportation "Location and Design
Manual, Volume Two Drainage Design".
      (2)   Criteria applying to all SCMs. SCMs chosen must be sized to treat
the water quality volume (WQv) and to ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality
Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1).
         A.   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            1.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the Village of
Fairport Harbor engineer that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-
specific hydrologic parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration
characteristics, slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed SCMs
controlling the amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local long-
term hourly records, or
            2.   Using the following equation:
               WQv = C*P*A/12
               where terms have the following meanings:
                  WQv   = water quality volume in acre-feet
                  C    = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1
in.
                  P   = 0.75 inch precipitation depth
                  A   = area draining into the stormwater practice, in acres.
Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA) for use in determining the WQv can be determined using the list in Table 1
or using the following equation to calculate the runoff coefficient
               C=0.858i3 - 0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:   
               i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
Table 1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage
area to the stormwater treatment structure is Low Density Residential, 30% is
High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1)(0.2) = (0.35)
         B.   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the stormwater practice for sediment storage. This volume
shall be incorporated into the sections of stormwater practices where
pollutants will accumulate.
         C.   (intentionally left blank)
         D.   Stormwater quality management practices shall be designed such
that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment and protect against
downstream bank erosion, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events as defined in Table 2.
         E.   (intentionally left blank)
         F.   Each practice shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection Plan and Maintenance Agreement for the site.

1 Practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv shall empty within 48 hours to
provide storage for subsequent storm events.
2 The use of a forebay and micropool is required on all dry extended setention
basins. Each is to be sized at a minimum 10% of the WQv. 3Provide both a
permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the permanent pool, each
sized with at least 0.75*WQv .
4Extended detention shall be provided for the WQv above the permanent water
pool.
5 The surface ponding area shall completely empty within 24 hours so that there
is no standing water. Shorter drawdown times are acceptable as long as design
criteria in Rainwater and Land Development have been met.
6 This includes grassed linear bioretention, which was previously titled
enhanced water quality swale.
7 Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the WQv in
a pool and 75% in marshes. The EDv above the permanent pool must be equal to
the WQv.
 
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
         A.   Infiltration facilities should be designed to meet all criteria
in Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove coarser sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         C.   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site. No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities: 
         A.   The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
half of the water quality volume in less than 1/3rd of the drain time. The
outlet shall be designed to minimize clogging, vandalism, maintenance, and
promote the capture of floatable pollutants.
         B.   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            1.   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run to
rise ratio of 4:1 or flatter.
            2.   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than 4 feet
shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least 8 feet and no
more than 15 feet outward from the normal water edge. The 8 feet wide portion
of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an average depth of 6
inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of aquatic vegetation.
The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than 15 inches below the
permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to individuals who accidentally or
intentionally enter the basin, and to limit growth of dense vegetation in a
manner that allows waves and mosquito predators to pass through the vegetation.
The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall be 10 (H) to 1 (V). The aquatic
bench shall be planted with hearty plant species comparable to wetland
vegetation that are able to withstand prolonged inundation.
            3.   A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at basin inlets. The forebay and micropool volume shall
be equal to at least 10% of the water quality volume (WQv).
            4.   Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency drain,
where practicable, so that the basin may be emptied if the primary outlet
becomes clogged and/or to drain the permanent pool to facilitate maintenance.
The emergency drain should be designed to drain by gravity where possible.
Note: The section below identifies the criteria that are currently be used by
the Ohio EPA to assess the equivalency of alternative practices that are not
listed in Table 2.
      (5)   Criteria for the Acceptance of Alternative post-construction SCMs:
The applicant may request approval from the Village of Fairport Harbor engineer
for the use of alternative structural post-construction SCMs if the applicant
shows to the satisfaction of the Village of Fairport Harbor engineer that these
SCMs are equivalent in pollutant removal and runoff flow/volume reduction
effectiveness to those listed in Table 2. If the site is greater than five (5)
acres, or less than five (5) acres but part of a larger common plan of
development or sale which will disturb five (5) or more acres, prior approval
from the Ohio EPA is necessary. To demonstrate the equivalency, the applicant
must show:
         A.   The alternative SCM has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of 80 percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance
Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         B.   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected SCM is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State. The discharge
rate from the SCM will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate
one of the following conditions:
            1.   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            2.   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            3.   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100 percent of
the project area is already impervious surface and the stormwater discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
            4.   The stormwater drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than 5 percent of the water area upstream of the
development site, unless a (TMDL) has identified water quality problems in the
receiving surface water of the State.
   (d)   Stormwater Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
       (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than
the Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method or other
hydrologic method approved by the Village of Fairport Harbor engineer, the
total volume (acre-feet) of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on
the development drainage area before and after development. These calculations
shall meet the following standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   (intentionally left blank).
            4.   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            5.   Rainfall Depth - For the most accurate, up-to-date, location-
specific rainfall data for stormwater design, use the Precipitation-Frequency
Atlas of the United States, NOAA Atlas 14, Vol 2(3). [available online: http://
hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.]
            6.   Temporal Distribution - Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events with a recurrence interval greater than 1
year. Include lot coverage assumptions used for full build out of the proposed
condition.
            7.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition shall reflect
the average type of land use over the past 10 years and not only the current
land use.
            8.   (intentionally left blank)
            9.   (intentionally left blank).
         B.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface proposed in the site
description except in instances of engineered permeable pavement systems. From
the volume determined in Section
1128.09(d)(3)A., determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table
3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
                                                       
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff is: The Critical Storm
                                                      will be:
                                                       
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:               
----                      10                          1 year
10                        20                          2 year
20                        50                          5 year
50                        100                         10 year
100                       250                         25 year
250                       500                         50 year
500                       ---                         100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area. The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
 
   (e)   Stormwater Management on Redevelopment Projects
      (1)   Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans for redevelopment
projects shall reduce existing site impervious areas by at least 20 percent. A
one-for-one credit towards the 20 percent net reduction of impervious area can
be obtained through the use of green roofs. Where site conditions prevent the
reduction of impervious area, SCMs shall be implemented to treat at least 20
percent of the WQv
      (2)   When a combination of impervious area reduction and stormwater
quality control facilities are used, ensure a 20 percent net reduction of the
site impervious area, provide for treatment of at least 20 percent of the WQv,
or a combination of the two.
      (3)   Where projects are a combination of new development and
redevelopment, the total water quality volume required to be treated shall be
calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the new development at
100 percent water quality volume and redevelopment at 20 percent.
      (4)   Where conditions prevent impervious area reduction or on-site
stormwater management for redevelopment projects, practical alternatives as
detailed in Section
1128.10 may be approved by the Village of Fairport Harbor engineer.
         (Ord. 2017-025. Passed 2-21-17.)
1128.10 ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   (a)   When the Village of Fairport Harbor determines that site constraints
compromise the intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used
that result in an improvement of water quality and a reduction of stormwater
quantity. Such alternatives shall meet the following standards:
      (1)   Shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity and quality
control that would be achieved by the on-site controls required under this
regulation.
      (2)   Implemented in the same Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 12 watershed
unit as the proposed development project.
      (3)   The mitigation ratio of the water quality volume is 1.5 to 1 or the
water quality volume at the point of retrofit, whichever is greater.
      (4)   An inspection and maintenance agreement as described in Chapter
1128.08(d)(10) is established to ensure operations and treatment in perpetuity.
      (5)   Obtain prior written approval from Ohio EPA.
   (b)   Alternative actions may include, but are not limited to the following.
All alternative actions shall be approved by the Village of Fairport Harbor
engineer:

   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the Village of Fairport Harbor engineer,
access easements between a public right-of-way and all SCMs shall be no less
than 25-feet wide. The easement shall also incorporate the entire practice plus
an additional 25-foot wide band around the perimeter of the SCM.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
   (e)   Easements to structural SCMs shall be restricted against the
construction therein of buildings, fences, walls, and other structures that may
obstruct the free flow of stormwater and the passage of inspectors and
maintenance equipment; and against the changing of final grade from that
described by the final grading plan approved by the Village of Fairport Harbor.
Any re-grading and/or obstruction placed within a maintenance easement may be
removed by the Village of Fairport Harbor at the property owners' expense.
      (Ord. 2017-025. Passed 2-21-17.)
1128.12 MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.

estimated cost for providing these services.
(Ord. 2017-025. Passed 2-21-17.)
1128.15 BOND.
   (a)   If a Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan is required by this
regulation, soil-disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a cash bond
of 5% of the total project cost has been deposited with the Village of Fairport
Harbor Finance Department. This bond shall be posted for the Village of
Fairport Harbor to perform the obligations otherwise to be performed by the
owner of the development area as stated in this regulation and to allow all
work to be performed as needed in the event that the applicant fails to comply
with the provisions of this regulation. The stormwater bond will be returned,
less Village of Fairport Harbor administrative fees as detailed in Chapter
1128 of the Village of Fairport Harbor Codified Ordinances, when the following
three criteria are met:
      (1)   After 80% of the lots of the project have been complete or 100% of
the total project has been permanently stabilized or three (3) years from the
time of permanent stabilization have passed.
      (2)   An As-Built Inspection of all stormwater control measures as
described in
1128.12 is approved by the Village of Fairport Harbor engineer.
      (3)   An Inspection and Maintenance Plan has been approved by the Village
of Fairport Harbor and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement has been signed by
the developer, the contractor, the Village of Fairport Harbor, and the private
owner or homeowners association who will take long term responsibility for
these SCMs, is accepted by the Village of Fairport Harbor engineer.
   (b)   Once these criteria are met, the applicant shall be reimbursed all
bond monies that were not used for any part of the project. If all of these
criteria are not met after three years of permanent stabilization of the site,
the Village of Fairport Harbor may use the bond monies to fix any outstanding
issues with all stormwater management structures on the site and the remainder
of the bond shall be given to the private lot owner/ homeowners association for
the purpose of long term maintenance of the project.
(Ord. 2017-025. Passed 2-21-17.)
1128.16 INSTALLATION OF WATER QUALITY STORMWATER CONTROL MEASURES.
   The applicant may not direct runoff through any water quality structures or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the Village of Fairport Harbor engineer. This occurs after the
completion of the final grade at the site, after all of the utilities are
installed, and the site is subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other
appropriate methods. The developer must provide documentation acceptable to the
Village of Fairport Harbor engineer to demonstrate that the site is completely
stabilized. Upon this proof of compliance, the water quality structure(s) may
be completed and placed into service. Upon completion of installation of these
practices, all disturbed areas and/or exposed soils caused by the installation
of these practices must be stabilized within 2 days.
(Ord. 2017-025. Passed 2-21-17.)

1129.16 ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN: NEIGHBORHOOD AND SUBURBAN CONTEXT COMMERCIAL AND
RETAIL STRUCTURES.
   (a)   Applicability. These requirements apply in the C-3 District.
Development in the C-1 District must conform to the standards in this section,
or the village center commercial and retail standards.
 
   (b)   Intent. Commercial buildings in the Village should not be considered
disposable, but rather built to age gracefully and maintain their
functionality, with the intent of being a future landmark worthy of
preservation efforts decades after construction. These standards are intended
to ensure new development is compatible with the built environment, and
respects and reinforces the unique character and sense of place of the Village,
while creating a built environment attractive to prospective consumers, thus
resulting in a healthy and desirable business climate.
 
   (c)   Character and Image. Building design must contribute to the sense of
place by using predominant materials, elements, features, color range and
activity areas tailored specifically to the site and its context. Standard
formula or prototype building designs must be modified if necessary to conform
to Village design standards; cookie-cutter architecture is unacceptable. In
shopping centers or multiple building developments, individual buildings must
include predominant characteristics shared by all buildings in the development
so the development forms a cohesive place.
 
   (d)   Forms and Mass. A single, large, dominant building mass must be
avoided in new buildings and projects involving changes to the mass of existing
buildings. Changes in mass should be related to entrances, the integral
structure and/or the interior space organization and activities, and not just
for cosmetic effect. False fronts or parapets create an insubstantial
appearance and are prohibited.
 
   (e)   Exterior Walls and Facades.
      (1)   Pattern.
         A.   Facades and walls must include a repeating pattern with an
expression of architectural or structural bays through a change in plane >1

elements must repeat at intervals of <30 feet.
      (2)   Base. Facades and walls must have a recognizable “base” with (but
not limited to):
         A.    Integrally textured materials such as stone or other masonry;
         B.   Integrally colored and patterned materials such as smooth-
finished stone;
         C.   Lighter or darker colored materials, mullions or panels; or
         D.   Planters and a recognizable “top” with (but not limited to):
         E.   Cornice treatments, other than colored “stripes” or “bands”
alone, with integrally textured materials such as stone or other masonry or
differently colored materials;
         F.   Sloping roof with overhangs and brackets;
         G.   Stepped parapets.
      (3)   Four-sided design. All walls must include materials and design
characteristics consistent with those on the front. Lesser quality materials
for side or rear walls are prohibited. Rear and side wall materials that are
allowed to be used are: Brick, vinyl siding, wood shingles, shakes or siding
(except plywood sheeting as the exposed material) or any materials that are
greater quality and approved by the Village Architectural Review Officer.

long must include wall plane projections or recesses having a >3% depth of the
facade length, and extending >20% of the facade length.
      (5)   Street facing walls. Walls must not have a blank, uninterrupted
length >30 feet without including two or more of these features: change in
plane, change in texture or masonry pattern, windows, or other equivalent
elements that subdivide the wall into human scale proportions. Side or rear
walls facing walkways may include false windows and door openings defined by
frames, sills and lintels, or similarly proportioned modulations, only when
actual doors and windows are not feasible because of the building use.
      (6)   Street facing facades. Facades and walls facing streets, parking
lots (excluding parking lots at rear loading docks), and/or connecting
pedestrian walkways must be divided and proportioned using features such as
windows, display areas, entrances, arcades, arbors, and awnings along >60% of
the facade.
      (7)   Primary building entrances. Primary building entrances must be
clearly defined and recessed or framed by a sheltering element such as an
awning, arcade or portico to provide shelter from the sun and inclement
weather.
      (8)   Retail building entrances. Anchor stores, >50% of the stores in a
shopping center; and freestanding, single-use buildings, must have a clearly
defined, highly visible customer entrance with four or more of the following
design elements:

         (Ord. 2008-133. Passed 12-15-08.)
1129.17  ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN: INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURES.
   (a)   Applicability. These requirements apply in the I District.
 
   (b)   Intent. Industrial sites are not frequently visited by the public, but
they are often quite visible to Village residents and visitors. Quality
architectural design helps offset the perceived impact of industrial uses, and
creates a professional environment that reflects positively on the Village and
its businesses.
 
   (c)   Character and Image. Building design must include predominant
materials, elements, features, color range and activity areas tailored
specifically to the site and its context. In industrial parks, each building
must include predominant characteristics shared by all buildings in the
development, so the development forms a cohesive place.
 
   (d)   Form and Mass. A single, large, dominant building mass must be avoided
in new buildings and, to a reasonable feasible extent, in projects involving
changes to the mass of existing buildings. Changes in mass must be related to
entrances, the integral structure and/or the organization of interior spaces
and activities and not merely for cosmetic effect. False fronts or parapets
create an insubstantial appearance and are prohibited.
 
   (e)   Exterior Walls and Facades.  
      (1)   Pattern.  
         A.   Facades and walls must include a repeating pattern with an
expression of architectural or structural bays through a change in plane >12"
wide, such as:

and one or more of the following elements:
            1.   Color change;
            2.   Texture change; and
            3.   Material module change.
         B.   All elements must repeat at intervals of <30 feet.
      (2)   Four-sided design. All facades and walls must include materials and
design characteristics consistent with those on the front facade. Rear and side
wall materials that are allowed to be used are: brick, vinyl siding, wood
shingles, shakes or siding (except plywood sheeting as the exposed material) or
any materials that are greater quality and approved by the Village
Architectural Review Officer.
      (3)   Garage doors. Bay doors must be screened using wing walls,
carefully placed berms on the site, or other effective screening and site
planning techniques, or otherwise sited so visibility from the public right-of-
way is minimized. Bay doors must not face the street. Bay doors must be
integrated into the overall design theme of the site with color, texture, and
windows. Segmented garage bay doors with windows are preferred to roll-up
garage doors.
       (4)   Primary building entrances.
         A.   Primary building entrances must be clearly defined and recessed
or framed by a sheltering element as an awning, arcade or portico to provide
shelter from the sun and inclement weather.
         B.   High Street accessibility ramp and landscaping planter locations.
All future improvements to commercial establishments along the east side of
High Street from Third Street to Fourth Street that require a building permit
or improve the sidewalk and/or entrances to the commercial establishments along
this section of High Street shall require the installation of accessibility
ramps to the entrance of the building.
The accessibility ramps must be a minimum of 5 feet - 4 inches in width from
the face of the building and leave a remaining sidewalk width of 10 feet - 4
inches to the face of the roadway curb. In cases where the accessibility ramp
and remaining sidewalk width is greater than the combined 15 feet - 8 inches, a
concrete landscaping planter shall be installed from the distance of 10 feet -
4 inches from the face of the roadway curb to the limit of the 5 feet - 4 inch
accessibility ramp. As a result, the limit of the accessibility ramps and/or
concrete landscaping planter will be 10 feet - 4 inches from the face of the
roadway curb for all of the commercial establishments along this defined
section of High Street. Refer to the Accessibility Ramp Standards - Typical
Drawings for the typical layout of the accessibility ramps and/or Concrete
Landscaping Planters, attached as Exhibit A of original Ordinance 2009-032.
         C.   High Street accessibility ramp and landscaping planter materials
and dimensions. Commercial establishments requiring the installation of
accessibility ramps and concrete landscaping planters as previously defined

granular material foundation. The accessibility ramp railings shall be
constructed with metal railings meeting the materials and style as defined by
the Accessibility Ramp Standards - Typical Drawings, attached as Exhibit B of
original Ordinance 2009-032. All accessibility ramps, concrete landscaping
planters and railing dimensions shall be as defined by the Accessibility Ramp
Standards - Typical Drawings, are attached as Exhibit C of original Ordinance
2009-032.
All accessibility ramps, concrete landscaping planters and railings shall be
submitted for review and approval through the preparation of the site plan as
prepared by a registered civil engineer. The site plan submittal shall be in
accordance with these Codified Ordinances. All accessibility ramps, concrete
landscaping planters and railing installations will require inspection during
construction by the Village or the Village Engineer.
         D.   When the accessibility ramps are built in conformity with the
requirements of this section, the accessibility ramps do not have to meet the
building or structure setback requirements that are set forth in these Codified
Ordinances at Part Eleven - Planning and Zoning Code, Title Three - Zoning.
         E.   When the accessibility ramps are to be installed in the road
right of way, the accessibility ramps shall be maintained in a safe condition
and the accessibility ramp, landscaping planters and railings shall be
maintained in good repair by the property owner who is contiguous to the
accessibility ramp. The property owner who is contiguous to the accessibility
ramp shall indemnify, protect, and hold harmless the Village from any claim,
loss, or damage arising in any way from property owner who is contiguous to the
accessibility ramp use or the user’s use of the right-of-way including, but not
limited to traffic control, OSHA, or the construction, operation or maintenance
of the user’s facilities or from any user’s negligent or wrongful act or
omission. In addition to other requirements set forth herein, each property
owner who is contiguous to the accessibility ramp and/or the user of the right-
of-way shall:
            1.   Locate the accessibility ramp within the right-of-way in
accordance with the provisions of this section;
            2.   Use its best efforts to cooperate with other users and the
Village for the best, most efficient, most aesthetic, and least obtrusive use
of the rights-of-way, consistent with safety, and to minimize traffic and other
disruptions, including street cuts;
            3.   Ensure that above ground structures and facilities do not
constitute a hazard to traffic and would not cause undue damage to any person
or vehicle using the rights-of-way;

1129.18 LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING.
   (a)   Purpose Statement:  The purpose of these regulations is to help
protect and preserve important natural and environmental variables, and their
functions, of a site while enhancing the overall character and appearance of
the built environment. Specific objectives include:
      (1)   Minimize potential noise, glare and visual clutter of outdoor
storage, rubbish areas, dumpsters, parking and loading areas by obscuring the
view with landscaping and screening.
      (2)   Provide protection from soil erosion
      (3)   Soften the appearance of building masses and break up and reduce
the impact of large parking areas.
      (4)   Remove, reduce, lessen or absorb the impact between one use or zone
and another.
(Ord. 2008-133. Passed 12-16-08.)
   (b)   Applicability. A Landscape Plan is required to be submitted for any
use or development involving the construction, reconstruction or expansion of
structures in the C-1, C-2, C-3, I, M-R, M-I, and MF zones or non-residential
uses permitted in the residential zones. The Landscape Plan shall be submitted
as part of the Site Plan requirements set forth in Section
1125.08  (d)(3)O.
(Ord. 2008-133. Passed 12-16-08; Ord. 2010-28. Passed 7-6-10.)
   Existing landscape material shown on a site plan that is in satisfactory
condition may be used to satisfy any landscaping requirement in whole or part.
   Where this section and other areas of the Zoning Ordinance conflict one
another, the provisions in this section shall apply.
 
   (c)    General Requirements. The proposed location of buildings, off-street
parking areas, and other earth disturbing activities shall be accomplished with
the desire to minimize the removal of individual trees having a trunk diameter
of six (6) inches or greater as measured four and one-half (4 1/2 ) feet above
ground level.
    Landscape materials shall be arranged to create varied and attractive views
and complement the architectural features of the principal structure on the
site. Any landscape or screening material that is a required element of a
regulation or approved development plan that dies or is destroyed shall be
replaced within 60 days, or when soil conditions permit, and shall take place
for the first two(2)years after project completion. Plans shall be implemented
within 120 days of project or phase completion or when soil conditions permit.
   In areas where general planting will not prosper, other materials such as
fences, walls, shavings of wood, brick, stone, gravel and cobbles shall be
used. Carefully selected plants shall be combined with such materials where
possible. Every effort shall be made during construction to preserve existing
healthy trees and shrubs on the site. Preservation of trees and vegetation of
special significance due to size, age, habitat, or historical significance is
highly encouraged.
   A mature tree, tree mass or woodland should remain on the site providing it
does not pose any undue threat to health, safety and welfare by its location
with respect to any proposed improvements to the site.
   Consultation/review by a certified Arborist, Urban Forester or similar
expert shall be used, if needed, at the expense of the property owner.
   The plan must be prepared by a landscape architect or other landscape design
professional. The plan shall contain the items set forth in Section
1125.08(d)(3)O. of the Site Plan Review.
 
   (d) Building Planting Requirements (All Districts Except C-2):
      (1)   General requirement: A minimum five foot (5') planting area shall
be provided between all building walls and paved areas except at service areas,
mechanical equipment areas and primary pedestrian access points to the
structure. Open structures such as porches, canopies, balconies, platforms,
carports, covered patios and walkways and similar architectural projections
shall be considered parts of the building to which attached. The five (5) foot
planting area shall be landscaped.
      (2)   Planted rear and side yard: Landscape areas will be in accordance
with the rear and side-yard setbacks established in the zoning district in
which the proposal is located. Areas outside the requirements in subsection (d)
(1) hereof, a, and areas not paved, shall be landscaped with live ground cover
or lawn.
 
   (e)    Building Planting Requirements C-2. General Requirement: Any area
between the building and the property or right-of-way line shall be a planting
area, except at service areas, mechanical equipment areas, and primary
pedestrian access points to the structure. Open structures such as porches,
canopies, balconies, platforms, carports, covered patios and walkways, and
similar architectural projections shall be considered parts of the building to

IMAGES/0-0-0-3038.jpg]
   Interior parking guidelines are intended to define major circulation aisles
and driving lanes and provide visual and climatic relief from broad expanses of
pavement.
      (1)   Any open parking area (including parking spaces and interior access
lanes, but excluding loading, unloading and storage areas) that contain more
than six thousand (6,000) square feet of area or twenty (20) or more vehicular
parking spaces shall provide interior landscaping in addition to any other
required perimeter landscaping.
      (2)   The amount of this interior landscaping shall be a minimum of ten
percent (10%) of the total parking area. Interior parking area does not include
access drives or ingress/egress areas.
      (3)   Landscaped areas shall be evenly dispersed throughout parking area
in islands or peninsulas, provided each island or peninsula is not less than
one hundred (100) square feet in size. Design shall not impede internal
vehicular traffic circulation. Each island shall be a minimum of five (5) feet
in any horizontal direction.
      (4)   Within landscaped islands or peninsulas, one major shade tree shall
be provided for every ten (10) parking spaces. Required trees placed in islands
shall be placed in a space containing at least one hundred fifty (150) square
feet of pervious area per tree to allow for adequate root aeration and
expansion.
      (5)   Each tree, at the time of installation, shall have a clear trunk
height of at least six (6) feet and a minimum caliper of two (2) inches.
      (6)    Remaining areas shall be vegetated with grass or similar low level
plant material not to exceed two (2) feet in height.

(Ord. 2008-133. Passed 12-16-08.)
 
   (g)    Landscaping along Road Frontage (Illustration 2). The landscape strip
is required in the C-1, C-3, I, M-R, M-I and MF districts. The landscape strip
is measured from the right-of-way line to the parking lot.
(Ord. 2008-133. Passed 12-16-08; Ord. 2010-28. Passed 7-6-10.)
      (1)   This landscape strip shall be provided along the full width of the
lot and shall be unoccupied, except for landscape treatments such as trees,
plantings, earth mounds, terraces, shrubs, permitted signs, and driveways
(generally perpendicular to the right-of-way line).
      (2)   Within this landscape strip, there shall be at least one (1), two
(2) inch caliper deciduous tree or small flowering tree with creative placement
for every thirty-five (35) feet of road frontage, along with random shrub
plantings. Recommend five (5) shrubs randomly staggered every thirty-five (35)
feet of road frontage.
      (3)   Landscape mounds shall have an elevation at least two feet (2)
higher than the finished elevation of the parking lot. Earth mounds and
decorative landscape treatments shall not block adequate safe distances at
driveway locations and intersections.
      (4)    The width of the landscape strip shall be no less than ten (10)
feet. Corner lots shall have a landscape strip of required width on both
frontages.
       (5)   Mounds shall block or screen the view of adjacent off-street
parking areas and shall be constructed with plant materials to prevent erosion.
Slopes on earthen mounds shall be no greater than 2:1 with a minimum crown
width of at least two feet (2) to create a generally flat crest.
         A.   The transition between existing grade and the slope of a mound
should be gradual with contouring intended to make the mound appear as part of
natural landscape. Gradual slope variation within the mound will encourage a
more natural appearance.
         B.   Where applicable, trees should be planted on the shallower
portion of the slope.
         C.   It is recommended the top twelve inches (12") of the mound
consist solely of high quality topsoil.
      (6)   The grading plan and landscape plan shall evaluate the site and
ensure underground utilities, surface water and groundwater flow, and mature
trees are not adversely affected by the landscape strip.

(Ord. 2008-133. Passed 12-16-08.)
 
   (h)   Perimeter Parking Lot Guidelines. Landscaping around the perimeter of
parking lots is required in the C-1, C-2, C-3, I, M-I, M-R and MF districts.
(Ord. 2008-133. Passed 12-16-08; Ord. 2010-28. Passed 7-6-10.)
      (1)   Landscape areas will be in accordance with the side-yard setbacks
established in the zoning district in which the proposal is located. Perimeter
screening shall effectively conceal parking areas and interior driveways from
adjoining property with the use of earth mounds, a planting strip, hedge, or
fence material for visual separation from adjoining property.
       (2)   In areas where a common (shared) interior access point between
businesses is proposed, the perimeter landscaping requirement for that area is
waived.
 
   (i)   Landscaping/screening for Service Structure(s). Service structures
include, but are not limited to, loading/unloading docks, propane tanks,
electrical transformers, and other equipment or elements providing service to
the building or site.
      (1)   Screening shall include a continuous planting, hedge, fence or
similar feature that will enclose any service structure on all sides. Fences
shall be designed in accordance with Chapter
1307 .
      (2)   Screening established with plant materials shall provide seventy-
five percent (75%) opacity with two years (2) of planting and shall be equally
effective in the winter and summer. All other types of screening shall
completely screen service structures. Construction materials and design
features shall be consistent with the primary structure on site.
      (3)   The minimum height of screening material shall be two (2) feet more
than the height of the enclosed structure, but shall not exceed ten (10) feet.
      (4)   If a service structure is designed to be removed or emptied
mechanically on a regular basis, a curb to contain the placement of the
structure is required.
 
   (j)   Landscaping/screening Adjacent to Residential Areas.
      (1)   A minimum buffer strip of ten (10) feet shall be used when said
district abuts any residential district. This ten (10) foot buffer strip shall
be included in the side and rear yard clearance and shall not be additional
footage.
      (2)   The twenty 20-foot required buffer zone will be considered a
protected “Green Space”. The “Green Space” is a canopy cover with existing
mature trees or, if necessary, planted with additional selected hardwoods. If
soil and environmental conditions require other types of trees or plants, Best
Management Practices shall be utilized as recommended by a certified Arborist,
Urban Forester or other expert. Trees planted are required to be a variety of
the type (i.e. Maples, Oak, Beech, Elms, Conifers, etc.) that can achieve, as a
goal, a fifty percent ( 50%) canopy cover.
      (3)   Mature trees, tree masses, or woodlands existing in the required
buffer “Green Space” shall be designated “Tree Save Area" on all plans
including landscaping and site plans. All “tree save areas” shall be
unmistakably delineated in the field so that it is obvious to all equipment
operators and other construction personnel. A temporary physical barrier such
as a snow fence shall be erected a minimum of one (1) foot outside the drip
line on all sides of individual trees, trees masses or woodlands prior to major
clearing or construction. The barrier shall be placed to prevent the
disturbance to or compaction of soil inside the barrier, and shall remain until
construction is complete. The barrier shall be shown on all plans including the
landscape plan.
      (4)   The following practices are not permitted and considered harmful in
a “tree save area”: grading or trenching; placing backfill near trees; driving
or parking equipment in “tree save” areas; dumping of trash; storage of
construction materials and supplies.
         A.   Protected “Green Space” is not allowed to be used for water
retention, retention basins, storage, out buildings, or dumping of any type.
         B.   “Green space” maintenance, proper pruning, proper clearing of
dead trees, control of grape vine and other invasive plants/vegetation is
required to take place annually by the property owner (minimum requirement).
Consultation/review by a certified Arborist, Urban Forester or similar expert
shall be used, if needed, at the expense of the property owner.
 
   (k)   The site shall be planned to accomplish a desirable transition with
the streetscape, and to provide for adequate planting, pedestrian movement and
parking areas. In order to minimize run-off and provide adequate open space,
sites shall have a minimum pervious area of thirty percent (30%). Storm water
and water quality measures shall be integrated in the design of parking lots
and roof water runoff to assure that the runoff water quality is maintained or
improved. Incorporation of Best Management Practices (B.M.P.) such as rain
gardens and or bio retention basins shall be used.

capture an incoming and/or to transmit an outgoing radio frequency signal.
Includes the following types:
      (1)   “Omni-directional (or "whip") antenna”- receives and transmits
signals in a 360 degree pattern, and which is up to fifteen feet in height and
up to four inches in diameter.
      (2)   “Directional (or "panel") antenna” - receives and transmits signals
in a directional pattern typically encompassing and arc of 120 degrees.
      (3)   “Parabolic (or "dish") antenna” - a bowl-shaped device that
receives and transmits signals in a specific directional pattern.
      (4)   “Ancillary antenna” - an antenna that is less than twelve inches in
its largest dimension and that is not directly used to provide personal
wireless communications services. An example would be a global positioning
satellite (GPS) antenna.
      (5)   Other - all other transmitting or receiving equipment not
specifically described herein shall be regulated in conformity with the type of
antenna described herein which most closely resembles such equipment.
   (b)   “Co-location” means the use of a single support structure and/or site
by more than one wireless communications provider.
   (c)   “Equipment enclosure” means a structure, shelter, cabinet, or vault
used to house and protect the electronic equipment necessary for processing
wireless communications signals.
   (d)   “Personal wireless service” means a broad range of spectrum-based
services including commercial mobile services such as personal communications
services (PCS), cellular radio mobile services and paging services.
   (e)   “Substantial expansion” means an increase in the size of an existing
facility by twenty-five percent (25%) or more, of the height or width of tower
and/or equipment enclosure or a twenty-five percent (25%) or more increase in
the footprint of the existing site's ancillary structures (i.e., fencing, etc.)
   (f)   “Support structure” means the structure to which antenna and other
necessary associated hardware is mounted. Support structures include, but are
not limited to, the following:

the mobile unit with the land-based telephone lines.
(Ord. 98-37. Passed 6-2-98.)
1134.02  PERMITTED LOCATIONS.
   New wireless communications facilities may be located only on non-
residentially used properties in the following areas: municipal/government,
schools, and/or public parks. Additionally, wireless communication facilities
may be located inside/attached to existing electric high tension towers.
   These facilities shall be subject to the Regulations set forth in this
chapter and the regulations of the particular zoning district in which the
facility is proposed to be located, but only to the extent such regulations do
not conflict with the regulations set forth in this chapter.
   Wireless communication providers are expected to co-locate facilities. In
the event a new structure is necessary, providers are expected to site the
facilities in locations which are substantially sheltered from view. Facilities
requiring construction of a support structure should be located on a site that
is effectively isolated from view by structures or terrain features, or the
structure should be made to appear as an architectural element such as a flag
pole or light fixture. The location of the facility shall comply with all
natural resource protection standards, including those for floodplain wetlands,
and steep slopes.
(Ord. 98-37. Passed 6-2-98.)
1134.03  PROCEDURE: APPLICATION FOR CONSTRUCTION OF NEW FACILITIES OR EXPANSION
OF EXISTING FACILITIES.
   (a)   Applications are to be filed first with the Village Zoning Office for
its review, after which they shall be forwarded to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for its review of the proposed wireless communication antenna and/or
tower site(s). This review shall be conducted at a regularly scheduled meeting
of the Planning and Zoning Commission after the applicant's submission of a
site plan showing the location, type of structure and height being proposed,
and surrounding land uses. The applicant shall provide:
      (1)   A diagram or map showing the appearance of the proposed facility.
      (2)   Photosimulations of the proposed facility from effected residential
properties and rights of way.
      (3)   A map showing the locations and service areas of other wireless
communication facilities operated by the applicant in abutting communities and
those that are proposed by the applicant which are close enough to impact
service within the Village.
      (4)   A site/landscaping plan showing the specific placement of the
facility on the site; showing the location of existing structures, trees, and
other significant site features; and indicating type, locations and size of
plant materials used to screen facility components, and the proposed color(s)
for the facility.
      (5)   A signed statement indicating:
         A.   The applicant agrees to allow for the potential co-location of
two additional wireless communication facility equipment by other providers on
the applicant's structure or within the same site location; and will respond to
written requests for co-location within thirty days and provide a copy to the
Village.
         B.   That the applicant agrees to remove the facility within six
months after that site's use is discontinued.
      (6)   A lease agreement with the landholder that:
         Allows the landholder to enter into leases with other providers; and
provides that if the provider fails to remove the facility within six months
after its discontinued use, a bond will be provided by the applicant to
compensate the landholder for the cost of removal of the facility.
      (7)   The application shall also include the applicant's proposed number
of towers, if more than one, and the additional tower locations in the Village
and each contiguous community.
      (8)    The applicant shall also place on deposit the applicable fees as
required and obtain a certification from a registered engineer that the
proposal is in compliance with all federal, state, and local regulations.
      (9)   As part of the permit application, the applicant shall provide the
Village with a list of competitors and their addresses so the Village may
notify the competitors of the application to encourage co-location.
      (10)   The applicant for construction of a new facility shall provide
evidence acceptable to the Village that there is no technically suitable space
for the applicant's facilities reasonably available on an existing tower within
the geographic area to be served. If another existing tower is technically
suitable, the applicant must demonstrate that it has made written request to
co-locate on the existing tower and that the request was rejected by the owner
of the tower.
   (b)   Approval for construction of new telecommunication facilities or
expansion of existing facilities by the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
become effective only following review and public hearing by Village Council. A
copy of the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be filed with
the Fiscal Officer by the Clerk of the Planning and Zoning Commission. If,
within the thirty day period next succeeding such filing, Council, by a
majority vote, disapproves the Commission's action in granting the permit, the
permit shall be void and shall not be issued. Otherwise, it, together with any
additional conditions imposed by Council, becomes and is in full force and
effect on the day next succeeding the thirty day period. However, should
Council approve the action of the Commission within the thirty day period, the
permit becomes in full force and effect from the date of the approval. Any
decision to deny a permit to place, construct, or modify a wireless
communication antenna and/or tower shall be in writing and supported by
substantial evidence contained in a written record of the proceedings of
Council. A time limit of one year shall be included in the permit for
commencement of construction.
   (c)   Fees for the construction of new facilities or substantial expansion
of existing facilities shall be as follows:
      (1)   New wireless communication tower and facility and expansion of
existing facilities:    $2,000.00
      (2)   New wireless communication antenna:    $ 500.00
         (Ord. 98-37. Passed 6-2-98.)
1134.04 PROCEDURE: APPLICATION FOR CO-LOCATION ON EXISTING FACILITIES.
   (a)   Applicants for co-location on existing facilities are to appear before
the Planning and Zoning Commission after submission of a plan detailing the co-
location. The applicant shall provide:
      (1)   A map showing the locations and service areas of other wireless
communication facilities operated by the applicant in abutting communities and
those that are proposed by the applicant which are close enough to impact
service within the Village.
      (2)   A lease agreement with the landholder that provides for removal of
the additional equipment within ninety days after its discontinued use.
      (3)   The applicant shall place on deposit the applicable fees as
required and obtain a certification from a registered engineer that the
proposal is in compliance with all federal, state and local regulations.
   (b)   The requirement for review and public hearing by Village Council may
be waived upon notification of Council by the Planning and Zoning Commission
that the co- location or existing facilities does not require the construction
of a new tower or associated facilities, and the applicant's proposal will have
no significant impact on the existing appearance of the facility.
   (c)   Fees for the co-location on existing facilities, or minimal expansion
of existing facilities shall be as follows:
      (1)   Co-location of wireless communication facility on existing
structure:          $500.00

1134.05  TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION.
   Wireless communication monopole tower constructed up to, but not including,
200 feet in height above the finished grade, unless a lesser height is
technically feasible to service the geographical service area of the applicant
and potential co-locators.
   All applicants shall be required to construct or locate on a base tower
structure and structure foundation that is designed to be buildable up to, but
not including, 200 feet above the finished grade. Such structure shall be
designed to have sufficient structural capacity for the Village to allow for at
least three providers to be located on the structure when constructed to the
maximum allowable height. The wireless communication facility shall also be
designed to show that the applicant has enough space on its site plan for an
equipment building large enough to accommodate at least three users. If an
equipment building is initially constructed to accommodate only one user, space
shall be reserved on site for equipment building expansions to accommodate at
least three users. The maximum size of above-ground equipment buildings is 300
square feet for one provider and no more than 750 square feet in total.
   Towers and antennas shall be designed in accordance with the Ohio Basic
Building Code for winds and design loads.
(Ord. 98-37. Passed 6-2-98.)
1134.06  SITE DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   Free-standing telecommunications facilities (i.e., those not located
on or in existing electric high tension towers) shall conform to the following
site development standards:
      (1)   Support structures shall be set back from all residential property
lines a distance of no less than the height of the tower and shall comply with
all required setbacks of the zoning district in which it is located. The
Planning and Zoning Commission may permit the tower to be located closer to a
residential property line if the visual impact is therefore reduced, but in no
case shall be located less than 100 feet from a residential property line.
      (2)   Support structures shall be designed and placed on the site in a
manner that takes maximum advantage of existing trees, mature vegetation, and
structures so as to use existing site features to screen as much of the total
facility as possible from view, and use existing site features as a background
so that the facility blends into the background.
      (3)   Support structures, panel and parabolic antennas, and any
associated hardware shall be painted a nonreflective color or color scheme
appropriate and inconspicuous to the background against which the facility
would be viewed from a majority of points within its viewshed. The final colors
and color scheme must meet the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission
and blend with surrounding environmental characteristics.
   (b)   Equipment enclosures shall be placed underground, or partially
underground, unless site conditions do not permit such construction.
   The maximum size of equipment buildings is 300 square feet for one provider
and no more than 750 square feet in total. If there are multiple users, the
equipment must be sheltered in a single building, unless the applicant can show
a technical necessity for a separate building; in which case multiple buildings
must appear to be a single building.
 
   (c)   Fencing shall be constructed for both aesthetic and public safety
reasons. Fencing shall be at least six feet in height, but no more than eight
feet. Barbed wire at the top of the fence may be permitted upon approval of the
Village Planning Commission. The type of fence must meet the approval of the
Planning and Zoning Commission.
 
   (d)   Existing vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible.
A buffer area of not less than ten feet in depth shall be placed between the
facility and the public right- of-way, and any adjacent residential uses. This
buffer shall be landscaped with hardy evergreen shrubbery or trees in a tight
configuration at least six feet in height, so as to screen the facility. The
landscaping shall be maintained and promptly restored when necessary by the
owner of the tower.
(Ord. 98-37. Passed 6-2-98.)
 
1134.07  CO-LOCATION.
   A permittee shall cooperate with other providers in co-locating additional
antennas on support structures. A permittee shall exercise good faith in co-
locating with other providers and sharing the permitted site, provided such
shared use does not give rise to a substantial technical level impairment of
the ability to provide the permitted use. Such good faith shall include sharing
technical information to evaluate the feasibility of co-location. All
applicants shall demonstrate reasonable efforts in developing a co-location
alternative for their proposal.
(Ord. 98-37. Passed 6-2-98.)
1134.08 GENERAL.
   (a)   "No Trespassing" signs shall be posted around the facility with a
telephone number of a contact in case of emergency.
 
   (b)   The owner or operator of the facility shall agree to remove a non-
functioning facility within six months of ceasing its use. The owner of the
antenna and/or tower shall annually file a declaration with the Village as to
the continuing operation of every facility installed by the owner and shall
consent to an inspection of the facility upon request of the Village Engineer.
 
   (c)   The owner or operator shall be required as a condition of issuance of
a permit to post a cash or surety bond acceptable to the Village Solicitor of
not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per vertical foot from natural
grade of the wireless communication tower which bond shall insure that an
abandoned, obsolete or destroyed wireless communication antenna and/or tower
shall be removed within six months of cessation of use and abandonment. Any co-
locator shall be required to additionally execute such bond, as principal, to
insure that the bond will be in place during the period of time that the co-
locator occupies the tower.
 
   (d)   Outdoor storage of any supplies, vehicles, or equipment related to the
use of the facility is prohibited, except during initial construction or to
supply emergency power in the event of a power outage.
 
   (e)   Except as required by law, an antenna or a tower shall not be
illuminated and lighting fixtures or signs shall not be attached to the antenna
or tower. If lighting is required by FAA regulations, white strobe lights shall
not be permitted at night unless no other alternative is permitted by the FAA.
Lighting for security purposes shall be permitted only with prior approval of
the Planning and Zoning Commission.
 
   (f)   No advertising shall be permitted on the facility.
 
   (g)    There shall be a separation of at least one-half mile between new
wireless communication towers. The Planning and Zoning Commission may waive
this requirement with the approval of the Village Council for the purposes of
clustering of towers within electric high-tension towers right-of-way.
 
   (h)   Vehicular access to the equipment and facility shall be integrated
with existing parking and drives to the extent feasible, taking into
consideration existing traffic flow and safety.
 
   (i)   If an access road is developed exclusively for the facility, a locking
gate shall be installed to prevent unauthorized use of the access road.
 
   (j)   The wireless telecommunications facility shall be fully automated and
unstaffed except for periodic and necessary maintenance (except in the event of
an emergency or during construction).
 
   (k)   Construction activity shall comply with Section
511.03(b) of the Codified Ordinances to minimize the impact of construction
noise on nearby residents.
 
   (l)   The owner/operator shall provide the Village with information

1315.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization Village of Fairport Harbor. ARTICLE XVIII,
Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority
to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the health, safety, and
general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Council of the Village of
Fairport Harbor, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The Village of Fairport Harbor has special flood
hazard areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss
of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Fairport Harbor as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any
additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by Village of Fairport Harbor.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Lake County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Lake County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective May 4, 2021
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Fairport Harbor as required by Section
1315.04(c) Subdivisions and Other New Developments.
         Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Village of Fairport Harbor Village Hall, 220
Third Street, Fairport Harbor, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances or resolutions including subdivision
regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these
regulations and any other ordinance or resolution, the more restrictive shall
be followed. These regulations are not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair
any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this
ordinance and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction
conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall
prevail.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Fairport Harbor, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof,
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2021-35. Passed 4-20-21.)
1315.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
Accessory Structure
A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental and
subordinate to, the principal structure.
Appeal
A request for review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any
provision of these
regulations or a request for a variance.
Base Flood

year. The base flood may also be referred to as the one percent (1%) chance
annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)
The water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum,
usually the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American

assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified
special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
The agency with the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood
Insurance Program.
Fill
A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
Flood or Flooding
A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally
dry land areas from:
   (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
   (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)
Usually the initial map, produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting
approximate special flood hazard areas.
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
An official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development has delineated the areas of special
flood hazard.
Flood Insurance Risk Zones
Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood
hazard in specific areas of a community. Following are the zone definitions:
   Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
base flood elevations are not determined.
   Zones Al-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
with flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
   Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet (usually areas of ponding); base
flood elevations are determined.
   Zone A99:

the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than one (1) foot or with contributing drainage area less than
one (1) square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   Zone V
Coastal special flood hazard area subject to a 100-year flood from velocity
hazard (wave action); base flood elevations are not determined.
   Zone VE and Vl-30
Coastal special flood hazard area subject to a 100-year from velocity hazard
(wave action); base flood elevations are determined.
Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
The official report in which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has provided flood profiles,
floodway boundaries (sometimes shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and
the water surface elevations of the base flood.
Floodproofing
Any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or
adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate
or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their
contents.
Flood Protection Elevation
The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the base flood elevation plus one
(1) foot of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
Floodway
A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one-half foot at any point within the
community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
Freeboard
A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the
purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many
unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height
calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic
effect of urbanization in a watershed.
Historic structure
Any structure that is:
   (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
   (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district; or
   (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained by
Village of Fairport Harbor's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis
An analysis performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of
Ohio, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA,
used to determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
Letter of Map Change (LOMC)
A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend
or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the following
categories:
   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
A comment by FEMA regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction,
affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and
thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the
effective base flood elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
Lowest floor
The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a
structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the lowest floor" which
is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area,
provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design
requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures below the lowest
floor.
Manufactured home
A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes of these
regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile homes
as defined in Chapter 4781 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Mean sea level
For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations
shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
Manufactured home park
As specified in the Ohio Adm. Code 4781-12-0l(K), a manufactured home park
means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for
habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and
includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority. Manufactured home park does not include any tract of land used
solely for the storage or display for sale of manufactured homes.
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating
communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. This
insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster
assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and
their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an
agreement between local communities and the Federal government that states if a
community will adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce
future flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the
Federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as
a financial protection against flood loss.
New construction
Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by Village of Fairport Harbor
and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the
"start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial
or after May 15, 1980, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
Person
Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership,
association, or any other entity, including state and local governments and
agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code 111.15(A)(2) as

Special Flood Hazard Area
Also known as "Areas of Special Flood Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain
subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al-30,
A99, or V, VE. Special flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are
flood prone and designated from other federal state or local sources of data
including but not limited to historical flood information reflecting high water
marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a
watercourse.
Start of construction
The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of a building.
Structure
A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally above ground.
Substantial Damage
Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
structure to the before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial Improvement
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
   (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration
would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
Variance
A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations.
Violation
The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with
these regulations.

         A.   Each federal agency has a responsibility to evaluate the
potential effects of any actions it may take in a floodplain; to ensure that
its planning programs and budget request reflect consideration of flood hazards
and floodplain management; and to prescribe procedures to implement the
policies and requirements of EO 11988.
   (k)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that FAIRPORT HARBOR flood maps, studies and other data identified in
Section
1315.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six (6) months of the date
such information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or other new development proposals requiring the

         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in riverine areas where FEMA has provided base flood
elevations but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (k)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the
Village of Fairport Harbor, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Fairport Harbor have been modified by annexation or the community
has assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and
enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that
the Village of Fairport Harbor's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent
the Village of Fairport Harbor boundaries, include within such notification a
copy of a map of the Village of Fairport Harbor suitable for reproduction,
clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the Village
of Fairport Harbor has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory
authority.
   (l)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1315.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (4)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this ordinance
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
   (m)   Use of Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map and/or Flood Insurance
Study Data.
      (1)   Zone A:
         A.   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from
the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall reasonably utilized as best available
data.
         B.   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final food
elevation determination has been provided in a Letter of Final Determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
      (2)   Zones AE, Al-30, AH, AO, VE, and Vl-30:
         A.   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
            1.   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
            2.   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not
be used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or
until all appeals have been resolved.
         B.   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section
1315.04(i)(2) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the
best data available.
      (3)   Zones B, C, and X:
         A.   Use of BFE and flood way data from a preliminary FIRM or FIS are
not required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the effective FIRM
which are being revised to Zone AE, Al-30, AH, AO, VE, or Vl-30. Communities
are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
   (n)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1315.03(k)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the Village of Fairport Harbor and
the Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 0.5 ( one-half) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsections (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Village of Fairport Harbor specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1315.03(k)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
   (j)   Development standards for coastal high hazard areas The requirements
of this subsection (j) apply to development in coastal high hazard areas
designated zone V or VE on the community's effective FIRM [and when designated
on a preliminary or final FIRM issued by FEMA under the circumstances provided
in Section
1315.03(m)].
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated
on pilings or columns that may be armored as necessary to withstand Lake Erie
ice forces so that:
         A.   The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member supporting
the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the
flood protection elevation, and
         B.   The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is
anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects
of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components.
            1.   Water loading values shall be those associated with the base
flood.
            2.   Wind loading values shall be those defined according to
American Society of Civil Engineers 7-13 Minimum design loads and associated
criteria for buildings and other structures, or current version adopted by Ohio
Board of Building Standards.
            3.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop
or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction,
and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in
accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of
subsection (j)(1)A. and B.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the
space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with
non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or insect screening
intended to collapse without causing collapse, displacement, or other
structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting
foundation system.
         A.   For the purpose of subsection (j)(2), a breakaway wall shall have
a design safe loading resistance of not less than ten (10) and no more than
twenty (20) pounds per square foot.
         B.   Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading
resistance of twenty (20) pounds per square foot (either by design or where so
required by local or state codes) may be permitted only if a registered
professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet all
of the following conditions:
            1.   Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less
than that which would occur during the base flood; and
            2.   The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation
system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural
damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all
building components (structural and non-structural). Water loading values shall
be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values shall be those
defined according to American Society of Civil Engineers 7-16 Minimum design
loads and associated criteria for buildings and other structures, or equivalent
standard.
         C.   All space enclosed by breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or
insect screening below the lowest floor shall be used solely for parking of
vehicles, building access, or storage.
      (3)   The use of fill or redistributed existing fill, placed after the
initial identification of Zones V, VE or Vl-30 on the community's FIRM, for
structural support of buildings is prohibited.
      (4)   Alteration of sand dunes that will increase potential flood damage
is prohibited.
      (5)   Placement or substantial improvement of manufactured homes must
comply with subsection (j)(1) through (5).
      (6)   Recreational vehicles must either:
         A.   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
         B.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
         C.   Comply with subsection (j)(1) through (5).

all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
the Fairport Harbor Village Hall, 220 Third Street, Fairport Harbor, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof of
these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within twenty (20) days of the date of such notice and
order, or other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such
hearing or for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the
Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by
the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of
the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's
decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   ALL APPLICATIONS FOR A VARIANCE SHALL BE ACCOMPANIED BY A
VARIANCE APPLICATION FEE SET IN THE SCHEDULE OF FEES ADOPTED BY THE VILLAGE OF
FAIRPORT HARBOR AND THE FEE FOR ANY VARIANCE SHALL BE THE SAME AS IS SET FORTH
FOR A ZONING VARIANCE.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A. to K. hereof
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Lake Court of Common Pleas, pursuant to
Ohio Revised Code Chapter 2506.
(Ord. 2021-35. Passed 4-20-21.)

1375.05 VACANT BUILDING FEES.
   The fees shall be reasonably related to the administrative costs for

incurred by the Village in monitoring the vacant building site. The annually
increased fee amounts shall be reasonably related to the costs incurred by the
Village for demolition and hazard abatement of or repairs to vacant buildings,

under the provisions of this chapter within 180 days of its registry.
   (d)    All delinquent fees shall be paid by the owner prior to any transfer
of an ownership interest in the vacant building. A lien may be placed on the

building permit.
   (b)    A building which has suffered fire damage or damage caused by extreme
weather conditions shall be exempt from the registration requirement for a
period of 90 days after the date of the fire or extreme weather event if the
property owner submits a request for exemption in writing to the Zoning
Department. This request shall include the names and addresses of the owner or
owners, and a statement of intent to repair and reoccupy the building in an
expedient manner, or the intent to demolish the building.
   (c)    A building that is for sale and listed with a licensed State of Ohio
realtor or for lease shall be exempted for a period of 12 months from the start
of vacancy, provided that the owner submits proof to the Zoning Department of
such listing and for the sale or lease status.

property the applicant currently has within the Village; and the length of time
that the building for which the exception is sought has been vacant.
