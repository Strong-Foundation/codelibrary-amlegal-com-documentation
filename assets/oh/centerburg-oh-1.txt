AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE THE 2008 CODIFIED ORDINANCES; TO ADOPT NEW MATTER; TO
AMEND AND REPEAL CERTAIN OBSOLETE AND CONFLICTING LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS.
   WHEREAS, a determination has been made that the ordinances of the
Municipality of a permanent and general nature should be codified, and
   WHEREAS, Council has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H.
Drane Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council,
   NOW THEREFORE be it ordained by the Council of the Village of Centerburg,
Ohio:
   Section 1. That the ordinances of the Village of Centerburg, Ohio, of a

   Section 2. That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 5 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to October 1, 2008, which are inconsistent with any provision of
the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

Ordinances without an ordinance or resolution history at the end thereof
indicates that the section contains new material which is hereby enacted by
this adopting ordinance.
   Section 4. That through authentication and approval of this Ordinance the
Mayor and Clerk-Treasurer shall certify that the permanent and general
ordinances of the Municipality as codified therein are correctly set forth and
constitute the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Centerburg, 2008.
   Section 5. That this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, welfare and safety
for the reason that there exists an imperative necessity for the earliest
publication and distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and
residents of the Municipality, so as to facilitate administration, daily

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

(ORC 1.45)
      (3)   A.   The time within which an act is required by law to be done
shall be computed by excluding the first and including the last day; except
that when the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be
done on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
         B.   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last
day for doing the act or before its usual closing time on that day, the act may

101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

(Ord. 2021-27. Passed 12-6-21.)
145.04 SEXUAL AND DISCRIMINATORY HARASSMENT.
   The Village has a strict policy against any form of unlawful discriminatory
harassment. It is the policy of the Village to provide a working atmosphere
free from discriminatory insult, intimidation and other forms of harassment.
This policy applies to all of the Village's employees. Employees who violate
this policy will be subject to discipline up to and including discharge.
      (1)    Discriminatory Harassment: Harassment based on any legally-
recognized basis including, but not limited to, race, age, color, religion,
sex, marital status, veteran status, ancestry, national origin or physical or
mental disability, is a violation of Village policy. Harassment may be overt or
subtle, but whatever form it takes, verbal, nonverbal, or physical; harassment
is insulting and demeaning to the recipient. This cannot and will not be
tolerated in the workplace.
      (2)    Examples of Harassment: Verbal abuse, ethnic and religious
epithets, racial slurs or jokes, graffiti remarks written or drawn on walls or
other structures, obscene gestures, and hazing to name a few. Even derogatory
remarks between friends may lead to overt acts of unlawful discrimination.
      (3)    Sexual Harassment Defined: The Village maintains a strict policy
prohibiting sexual harassment and prohibits such harassment in any form,
including verbal and physical sexual harassment. Sexual harassment includes,
but is not limited to, making unwanted sexual advances and requests for sexual
favors where either [I] submission to such conduct is made an explicit or
implicit term or condition of employment; [2] submission or rejection of such
conduct by an individual is used as a basis for an employment decision
affecting such individual; or [3] such conduct has the purpose of affecting or
substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an
intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
      (4)   Responsibility for Reporting Harassment: All supervisors and all
other employees are responsible for ensuring that no harassment or
discrimination occurs within their area. Any employee witnessing or being
subjected to discrimination or harassment should immediately report it to the
Administrator, Personnel Officer or Mayor. Complaints of harassment or
discrimination will receive immediate attention.
      (5)    Investigation: An investigation will be conducted and may include
conferring with parties and witnesses named by the employee reporting, or who
is the subject of, the harassment or discrimination. Because of the sensitive
nature of such complaints, incidents must be investigated with particular care
and will remain, to the extent possible, confidential.
      (6)   Questions Regarding Harassment: Any questions concerning this
policy, are to be directed to the Administrator, Personnel Officer or Mayor.
         (Ord. 2021-27. Passed 12-6-21.)
145.05 PROBATIONARY PERIOD.
   (a)    An employee entering the service of the Village on a full-time or
part-time basis shall be considered a probationary employee for a period of six
(6) months. At the end of this period, an evaluation of the person's work
performance shall be made. The employee shall either:
      (1)    Be dismissed, by reason of failing to adequately perform the
duties required for the position;
      (2)    Have the probationary period extended for an additional six (6)
months. A probationary period may only be extended for an additional six (6)
months if the department head and Administrator agree after a conference with
the employee; or
      (3)    Be considered a permanent employee.
   (b)    A probationary employee shall accrue sick leave and vacation leave.
Sick leave may be used during the probationary period.
   (c)   An employee promoted to a higher position or transferred to another
position shall be classified as a probationary employee in that position for a
period of six (6) months. If the employee does not perform satisfactorily
during the six-month probationary period, the employee may be returned to the
previous position and seniority in that position shall be maintained.
   (d)   An employee who is changing his status from part-time or seasonal
status to full- time status, even if the employee is performing the same tasks
as performed in the part-time or seasonal status, shall be considered a
probationary employee for a period of six (6) months.
   (e)    Regardless of successful completion of the probationary period or
status as a permanent employee, all Village positions are employment-at-will.
Each position and/or employee can be terminated by the Village, and each
employee can terminate his/her employment with the Village, for any reason or
no reason, with or without notice at anytime, unless otherwise provided by the
Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 2021-27. Passed 12-6-21.)
145.06 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION.
   (a)    The Village Administrator, the Personnel Officer and/or an employee's
immediate supervisor will formally evaluate all full-time and regular part-time
employees at least annually. Probationary employees shall be evaluated at the
end of their probationary period. Employees serving promotional probationary
periods, employees who transfer to another department, or new regular part-time
employees shall be evaluated in the same manner.
   (b)    Each employee shall have the opportunity to meet with the
Administrator, Personnel Officer or his/her supervisor to discuss each
performance evaluation.

worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek or hours worked in excess of
their regularly scheduled working time of eight (8) hours (or ten (10) hours)
in a workday. Overtime pay is calculated by multiplying the employee's regular
rate of pay by one and one-half times the number of overtime hours worked. The
workweek for calculating overtime pay will be a seven (7) day workweek
beginning on Saturday at 12:00 a.m. An employee's use of accrued hours for sick
leave, vacation leave or compensatory time in a workweek will be included when
calculating overtime compensation.
   (b)    The Village may designate certain administrative, executive and
professional employees as being exempt from overtime pay based on the
guidelines of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Such employees shall be notified of
their exempt status by the Village Administrator. Although these employees are
not eligible for overtime pay consideration, the Village Administrator or his/
her designee may consider schedule adjustments or provide additional
compensation for working holidays and/or additional hours in excess of forty
(40) in a workweek. The Village shall review the duties and responsibilities of
its employees from time to time as it deems appropriate to determine whether
said employees are exempt or nonexempt for the purpose of overtime
compensation. Such review shall include the nature of the work, duties, minimum
qualifications and such other content-related work characteristics for each
employee.
   (c)   All non-exempt employees may elect to take compensatory time in lieu
of cash payment for overtime hours. Such compensatory time may accrue up to,
but not exceed, 120 hours (i.e., 80-over-time hours times the overtime rate of
one and one-half times overtime hours worked equals 120). Compensatory time
must be taken within the calendar year earned at a time convenient to the
employee and Village. The balance remaining on the last pay period of each year
shall be paid out in full at the employee's current hourly rate before the end
of that year.
      (1)   The Village will not accept the transfer of any compensatory time
where said compensatory time was accumulated during employment with another
public employer.
   (d)   When an employee elects to use compensatory time earned, he/she shall
submit such request to the Village Administrator no less than 48 hours prior to
its use. Scheduling of such compensatory time shall be at the discretion of the
Village Administrator and/or employee's supervisor and based upon staffing and
operation needs of the Village.
   (e)   Upon termination, the employee shall be compensated for all earned but
unused compensatory time at his/her current hourly rate or his/her average rate
of pay over the last three years, whichever is higher.
   (f)    Employees are instructed to not begin work early or perform work
beyond their scheduled quitting time without the approval of their immediate
supervisor, the Village Administrator, or the Mayor. Employees who work
overtime without advance approval, except
in extenuating circumstances, may be subject to discipline.
(Ord. 2021-27. Passed 12-6-21.)

time is available to supplement the two hours.
   (g)    On Christmas Eve day, or for a day of the week when the Christmas
holiday falls on a weekend, the Village Administrator and/or Mayor shall have
authority, subject to the needs of the Village, in their sole discretion to

if said employee leaves employment with the Village before the end of the first
calendar year and uses vacation time in excess of the amount equal to the
portion of the calendar year the employee has worked at the time of separation,
then the employee shall have the value of the excess vacation time paid to the
employee deducted from the final paycheck. (Ord. 2021-27. Passed 12-6-21.)
   (b)    To the extent any Village employee has earned vacation time in excess

requirements of the Village. In the event of a conflicting request, the
Administrator shall resolve the conflict based on the operation needs of each
department/division.

of the separation.
   (f)    Vacation credits are not earned while an employee is on unpaid leave
(leave of absence, disciplinary suspension, etc.) where an employee becomes
deceased while on unpaid status in Village employment, any accrued vacation
leave to the employees' credit shall be paid
in a lump sum first to the surviving spouse, then to the descendant's estate.
   (g)    The Village shall not accept the transfer of any vacation time
accumulated by an employee with any prior employer.

the Village, his or her supervisor shall notify the Village Administrator or

medical attention is required. Such report shall be forwarded to the Village
Administrator or designee immediately or as soon as practicable after the
accident.
   (b)    Should an employee's injury require medical attention, the supervisor
shall provide the injured employee with all necessary forms, which shall be
completed, by the employee and the attending physician. All forms should be
forwarded to the Village Administrator or designee at the earliest possible
date. The Village reserves the right to provide a physician for all work-

(Ord. 2021-27. Passed 12-6-21.)
145.13 FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE (FMLA LEAVE).
   (a)    Pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, ("FMLA") up to
twelve (12) weeks of unpaid FMLA leave may be granted to an employee who has
been employed for at least twelve (12) months by the Village and who has worked
at least 1,250 hours for the Village during the twelve (12) months before the
leave is requested. FMLA Leave may be requested for the following reasons:
      (1)   Because of the birth of a child or placement for adoption or foster
care of a child:
      (2)   In order to care for the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or one who
stood in place of a parent of the employee; if such spouse, son, daughter,
parent, or person "in loco parentis" has a serious health condition.
      (3)   Because of a serious health condition that makes the employee
unable to perform his/her employment functions.
   (b)    Definitions. For the purposes of this chapter:
      (1)   "Child" means a child either under eighteen (18) years of age, or
eighteen (18) years or older who is incapable of self-care because of mental or
physical disability. An employee's "child" is one for whom the employee has
actual day-to-day responsibility for care and includes a biological, adopted,
foster or stepchild or the child of one standing "in loco parentis."
      (2)   "Parent" means a biological parent or an individual who stands or
stood in loco parentis to an employee when the employee was a child. This term
does not include parents "in law."
      (3)   Persons who are "in loco parentis" include those with day-to-day
responsibilities to care for and financially support a child, or in the case of
an employee, who had such responsibility for the employee when the employee was
a child. A biological or legal relationship is not necessary.
      (4)   "Serious Health Condition" means an illness, injury, impairment, or
physical or mental condition that involves:
         A.   Any period of incapacity or treatment connected with in-patient
care (i.e.,an overnight stay) in a hospital, hospice or residential medical
care facility, and any period of incapacity or subsequent treatment in
connection with in-patient care.
         B.   Any period of incapacity requiring absence from work, school, or
other regular daily activities of more than three (3) calendar days and that
involves two (2) or more times of treatment by a health care provider, or
treatment on one occasion resulting in continuing treatment under the
supervision of a health care provider;
         C.   Any period of incapacity due to a chronic serious health
condition that requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care
provider, continues over an extended period of time, and may cause episodic
rather than continuing periods of incapacity, i.e., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy;
         D.   Any period of incapacity that is permanent or long-term due to a
condition for which treatment may not be effective, i.e., Alzheimer's, severe
stroke, terminal illness, so long as the employee or family member is under the
continuing supervision of a health care provider;
         E.   Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments by a health
care provider either for restorative surgery after accident or surgery, or for
a condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than
thee (3) days in the absence of medical intervention, i.e., cancer
(Chemotherapy, radiation), severe arthritis (physical therapy) or kidney
disease (dialysis); and recovery periods so designated by the health care
provider for such procedures;
         F.   Prenatal care by a health care provider.
      (5)   "Spouse" means a husband or wife as defined or recognized under
Ohio law. This definition does not include unmarried domestic partners. If both
spouses are working for the Village, their total leave in any twelve (12) month
period may be limited to an aggregate of twelve (12) weeks if the leave is
taken for either the birth or adoption of a child or to care for a sick parent.
   (c)    12-Month Leave Period. The Village will compute the twelve (12) month
period using a rolling twelve (12) month period measured backward from the date
leave commenced. In any case in which a husband and wife entitled to family
leave are both employed by the Village, the aggregate number of work weeks of
leave to which both may be entitled shall be limited to twelve (12) weeks taken
because of the birth of a child or placement for adoption or foster care of a
child.
   (d)   Substituting Paid Leave. All and any accrued available paid leave
benefits and disability benefits, if applicable, must be substituted for all or
any part of unpaid FMLA leave taken for any reason. An employee seeking FMLA
leave must first use paid sick leave, personal leave, vacation leave and
holiday leave, in that order, before going on unpaid leave. The total amount of
family leave paid and/or unpaid will not exceed a total of twelve (12) weeks.
An employee on leave for a work-related injury covered by worker's compensation
shall also be considered on FMLA Leave concurrently therewith.
   (e)    Notice Requirements. An employee shall provide the Village at least
thirty (30) days advance notice before FMLA leave is to begin if the need for
the leave is foreseeable. If thirty (30) days notice is not practicable, notice
must be given as soon as practicable. This notice may either be verbal or in
writing and shall include the anticipated timing and duration of the leave.
When planning medical treatment, the employee should consult with the Village
and make a reasonable effort to schedule the leave as to not unduly disrupt the
Village's operations, subject to the approval of the health care provider. In
the case of a request for intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave
schedule which meets the employee's needs without unduly disrupting the
Village's operations, subject to the approval of the health care provider, the
Village may waive these FMLA notice requirements. Should the employee fail to
give thirty (30) days' notice for foreseeable leave with no reasonable excuse
for the delay, the Village may deny the taking of FMLA leave until at least
thirty (30) days after the date the employee provides notice to the Village for
the requirements. Where the employee uses substituted paid leave, the notice
requirements applicable to such leave shall apply.
   (f)    Seniority. During an FMLA leave, an employee will continue to accrue
seniority if in a paid FMLA status.
   (g)    Insurance Benefits. During any FMLA leave, the Village shall maintain
all insurance benefits to which an employee was entitled prior to FMLA leave.
Any share of health premiums, which had been paid by the employee prior to FMLA
leave shall continue to be paid by the employee during the FMLA leave period.
If the FMLA leave is substituted paid leave, the employee's share of health
premiums shall be due at the same time as it would be made if by payroll
deduction. If the employee fails to timely make required health care premium
payments, the Village shall pay the employee's share of the employee's health
care premium payment. As provided by law, the Village may recover its share of
health plan premiums for the employee if the employee fails to timely make such
payments during the unpaid FMLA leave.
   (h)    Medical Certification Requirement. The following certification
requirements shall apply to FMLA leave requests:
      (1)   The Village will require certification of a serious health
condition. Employees who request leave because of their own serious health
condition or the serious health condition of a covered family member may be
required to provide a certification of their health care provider of the
employee or the employee's family member's condition. The Village shall give
the employee written notice of the requirement for medical certification in a
particular case.
      (2)   Employees must provide the requested certification to the Village
within the time frame requested by the Village, unless it is not practicable
under the particular circumstances to do so despite the employee's diligent,
good faith efforts. The Village must allow at least fifteen (15) calendar days
after the Village's request for certification.
      (3)   The Village may require certification to verify that the leave
meets the requirements for FMLA. Such certifications may be requested for FMLA
assignments made by either the Village and/or FMLA requests by the employee.
The protections of FMLA will not cover situations where the reason for leave no
longer exists, where the employee has not provided required notices or
certifications, or where the employee has misrepresented the reason for leave.
      (4)   In its discretion, the Village may require a second medical opinion
and periodic recertification at its own expense. If the first and second
opinions differ, the Village, at its own expense, may obtain the binding
opinion of a third health care provider, approved jointly by the employee and
the Village.
   (i)    Periodic Report. The Village may require an Employee on FMLA leave to
report periodically on the employee's status and intent to return to work, such
reporting periods shall be reasonable. If an employee gives notice of intent
not to return to work, this notice shall be considered a resignation, and the
Village's obligations under FMLA to maintain health care/insurance benefits
(subject to benefit continuation requirements under Ohio and/or federal law and
to return the employee to work ceases.)
   (j)   Leave Use. FMLA may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave
schedule, if deemed necessary by the employee's health care provider, for the
employee's own serious health condition, or to care for a sick family member.
Intermittent leave may be taken in separate blocks of time due to a single
illness or injury, rather than for one continuous period of time, and may
include leave of periods from an hour or more to several weeks. A reduced leave
schedule reduces an employee's usual number of working hours per workweek, or
hours per workday. Where FMLA is taken because of the birth or placement for
adoption or foster care, an employee may take leave intermittently or on a
reduced leave schedule only if the need is documented by a health care
provider.
   (k)    Fitness For-Duty Report. An employee who takes FMLA leave because of
the employee's own serious health condition may be required to obtain and
present certification from a licensed physician or other appropriate medical
professional that the employee is fit to return to work. The Village may seek
fitness-to-duty certification only with regard to the particular health
condition that caused the employee's need for the FMLA leave. If an employee
fails to provide such a fitness-for-duty certification to return to work, the
Village may deny restoration to work until the employee submits the
certification.
   (l)    Leave Designation. The Village reserves the right to designate all
FMLA qualifying leave as FMLA leave. All leaves that are granted, whether paid
or unpaid, for purposes which are covered under the FMLA, may be charged as
FMLA leave and shall be subject to the rolling twelve (12) week limitation for
any rolling twelve-month period.
(Ord. 2021-27. Passed 12-6-21.)
145.14 PERSONAL LEAVES OF ABSENCE.
   (a)    When sufficient personal reasons require (including but not limited
to having exhausted sick leave, personal days, vacation and/or family medical
leave) an employee, at the Village Administrator and Mayor's discretion, may be
granted an extended leave of absence without pay. A leave of absence will be
granted for an initial period of up to thirty (30) days, and employees may
request extensions up to thirty (30) days which may be granted at the Village's
discretion. No leave or cumulative leaves, may exceed six (6) months.
   (b)    Personal leave will be without pay except that employees may be
required to use any accrued paid vacation days, compensatory time, sick leave
and other accrued benefits during leave. While on leave, employees will not
accrue paid leave days of any kind.
   (c)    The Village may continue to make its regular payment to continue the
employee's benefits under its group health plan through the end of the month in
which the employee requests leave. Thereafter, employees on leave may continue
their benefits under the Village's group health insurance plan provided the
employee pays the entire monthly premiums due during the leave and provided
said benefit continuation is permitted by the Village's benefit provider.
Employees who wish to continue their insurance coverage should so advise the
Fiscal Officer before beginning their leave.
   (d)    The Village does not guarantee that the employee's job will be
available when the employee returns from a personal leave. However, upon return
from leave, the Village will make an effort to place an employee in his/her
previous position or a comparable position for which the employee is qualified
to perform the essential function of the job, with or without reasonable
accommodation. If no such position is available, the employee can reapply at a
later date as positions become available for which he/she is qualified to
perform the essential function of the job with or without reasonable
accommodations.

to the Village Administrator. This military leave policy will remain consistent
with the Ohio Revised Code.

suspicion to believe that the employee is under the influence of any illegal
drug or misusing alcohol or legal drugs, the Village may require the employee
to go to a medical clinic, at the Village's expense, to provide blood and/or
urine specimens. When a supervisor observes or is notified of behavior or
events that lead the supervisor to reasonably suspect that an employee has used
or misused a controlled substance, illegal drug or misused alcohol, the
supervisor should notify the Village Administrator or the Mayor. For purposes
of the above, "reasonable suspicion" shall generally mean suspicion based on
personal observation drawn from a specific behavior and conduct exhibited by
the employee; including but not limited to the following:
         A.   Observed use, possession or sale of illegal drugs and/or use,
possession, sale, or abuse of alcohol and/or the illegal use or sale of
prescription drugs.
         B.   Apparent physical state of impairment of motor functions or
physical symptoms of being under the influence of drugs or alcohol such as, but
not limited to, slurred speech, dilated pupils, odor of alcohol or marijuana.
         C.   Marked changes in behavior, attendance or performance decline not
attributable to other factors.
      (3)   Random Drug Testing: For the purpose of the Village's random drug
testing program, any position where the employee may be operating the Village's
vehicles or other power equipment will be considered to be a "safety sensitive"
position and the employee may be required to submit to a random drug testing
program administered by the Village Administrator. Policies and procedures for
this testing will be consistent with Federal and State laws and those policies
outlined in Chapter
145.
      (4)    Post-Accident Testing: Post-accident testing will be conducted
whenever an "accident" occurs. "Accident" is defined as an unplanned,
unexpected or unintended event that occurs within the Village, during the
conduct of the Village's business, or during working hours, or which involves
Village-supplied motor vehicles or motor vehicles that are used in conducting
Village business, or is within the scope of employment, and which results in
any of the following:
         A.    A fatality of anyone involved in the accident;
         B.    Bodily injury to the employee and/or another person that
requires off-site medical attention away from the Village's place of
employment;
         C.    Vehicular damage in apparent excess of seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00); or
         D.    Non-vehicular damage in apparent excess of five hundred dollars
($500.00).
         When such an accident occurs, any employee who contributed to the
accident will be tested for drugs or alcohol use or both.
         Urine specimen collection (for a drug test) or breath/saliva (for an
alcohol test) will occur immediately after an accident. At no time shall a drug
specimen be collected after thirty-two (32) hours from the time of an
employment-related incident. Breath or saliva alcohol testing will be performed
within two (2) hours of the accident whenever possible, but never beyond eight
(8) hours. If the employee responsible for an "accident" is injured, it is a
condition of employment that the employee herein expressly grants the Village
the right to request that attending medical personnel obtain appropriate
specimens (breath, blood and/or urine) for the purpose of conducting alcohol
and/or drug testing. Further, all employees herein expressly grant the Village
access to any and all other medical information that may be relevant in
conducting a complete and thorough investigation of the "accident", to include,
but not be limited to, a full medical report from the examining physicians(s)
or other health care providers.
      (5)    Testing of Employees with Commercial Driver's License (CDL):
Employees who are required to hold a CDL will be required to participate in the
Village's drug and alcohol testing program as required by federal law which
includes pre-employment testing, post accident testing, random testing,
reasonable suspicion testing, and return-to-work testing. Policies and
procedures for these programs will be consistent with federal law and will be
made available to employees required to hold CDL's and their supervisors.
      (6)    The following general guidelines and procedures shall be followed
and apply to testing:
         A.   If requested, the employee will sign a consent form authorizing
the clinic to withdraw a specimen of blood or urine and release the test
results to the Village.
         B.   A refusal to provide either specimen will constitute
insubordination and a presumption of impairment and will result in disciplinary
action. Further, any evidence of tampering, adulterating, or doctoring a test
will result in disciplinary action.
            The Village reserves the right to test for adulterants.
         C.   Any employee tested in accordance with the above procedure may,
if the test results are positive, request retesting at the employee's expense;
or may request, in advance of the original test, that a portion of the original
specimen be delivered to a third party for testing at the employee's expense.
         D.   The results of any such test will constitute medical information
and will remain confidential except for their use in official safety
investigations, criminal prosecution of the employee, or any action necessary
to defend the discharge or discipline of the employee.
         E.   The Village will select a Certified Lab to perform all tests. The
Lab will follow the most current federal and state guidelines and procedures
for such testing. All results will be reported to the Village Administrator.
The Village will pay the cost of the initial drug test.
         F.   Employees who test positive for an illegal substance abuse or
misuse of legal drugs, and/or alcohol will be subject discipline up to and
including termination unless they submit proof of completion of a treatment/
rehabilitation program approved by the Village. All costs related to the
program shall be borne by the employee. Paid leave may be used for any
rehabilitative program except for any period involving a disciplinary
suspension. A return to work certification must be provided before any such
employee will be able to return to work.
   Employees who test positive for alcohol, illegal substances or the misuse of
legal substances may be subject to random drug tests for a period of two (2)
years from the date that they have been approved to return to work. Such
employees who again test positive during this two-year period will be
terminated.
(Ord. 2021-27. Passed 12-6-21.)
145.26 USE OF VILLAGE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS.
   (a)   The Village may provide or contract for communication services and
equipment necessary to promote the efficient conduct of Village business.
Employees should be aware of the charges and expenses associated with such
services and equipment when selecting the vehicle for Village business
communication.
   (b)   All Village communication services and equipment, including but not
limited to mail, courier services, facsimiles, telex systems, video equipment

services, computers, computer networks, laptop or standalone computers, and all
communications and stored information transmitted, received, or contained in
the Village's information systems are the property of the Village and as such
are to be used solely for Village-related purposes. The use of such equipment
and software for private purposes is strictly prohibited. The Village may
access and monitor employee communications and files as it deems appropriate.
   (c)   Employees should not use Village communication services and equipment
for personal purposes except in emergencies or when extenuating circumstances
warrant it. Improper use of Village communications and equipment may result in
disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.
(Ord. 2021-27. Passed 12-6-21.)
145.27 CREDIT CARDS.
   Village credit cards must be used only for purchases relating to vehicles
owned or leased by the Village. Any other use is strictly forbidden, unless
said employee receives written permission from the Village Administrator. All
credit cards issued to Village employees must be returned to the Village Fiscal
Officer or Village Administrator immediately upon the earlier of termination of
employment or when authorization to use the card(s) is withdrawn.
(Ord. 2021-27. Passed 12-6-21.)
145.28 HIRING OF IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS.
   The Village will not employ members of a full-time employee's immediate
family. For this section, immediate family is defined as mother, father, wife,
husband, brother, sister, son, daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, and/or
any step children, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law,
any other (step) relationships created by marriage.
(Ord. 2021-27. Passed 12-6-21.)
145.29 TUITION REIMBURSEMENT.
   (a)    The Village may provide for tuition reimbursement for full-time
employees based upon the following criteria:
      (1)   The employee has completed their probationary period;
      (2)   Classes must be taken through an accredited institution of higher
education;
      (3)   The Mayor and Village Administrator have granted approval for the
course of study prior to the employee taking any classes and budgetary
appropriations have been approved;
      (4)   The degree being sought is required for a position within the
Village organizational structure. Any advanced degree must be directly related
to the employee's current position.
      (5)   Registration fees and textbooks for Distant Learning Programs or
Internet Programs for degrees from accredited institutions of higher learning
will qualify for reimbursement. Any software or hardware expenses where the
student makes such a purchase for any classes, those on campus or through an
off campus program, will not be considered costs eligible for reimbursement.
   Upon meeting these requirements, receiving a passing grade of a "C" or
better, and providing documentation of grades, all registration fees, and text
books, the employee may be reimbursed per calendar year up to a level
determined by Council in the annual employee compensation ordinance. No
reimbursements will be made for travel, meals, and parking. All reimbursements
will be consistent with all IRS regulations in effect at the time of the
reimbursements for reporting an employee's gross income on the W-2 form.
(Ord. 2021-27. Passed 12-6-21.)

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
161.    Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 161
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the Clerk of Court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St.. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest please may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date.
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

(Ord. 2018-01. Passed 1-2-18.)
171.02  DEFINITIONS.
   (A)    Any term used in this Chapter that is not otherwise defined in this
Chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the
ORC, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
Chapter that is not otherwise defined in this Chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the ORC and the use is not consistent, then the use of the
term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall
control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the ORC.
   (B)    The singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall
include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   (C)    As used in this Chapter:
      (1)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file
as a C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C
corporation under (C)(24)(d) of this division, means a C corporation's federal
taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:

withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of Centerburg. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and Centerburg as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold Centerburg income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to Centerburg the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to a
Centerburg income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for Centerburg until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for Centerburg during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year,;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar yea;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold Centerburg income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section
Occasional Entrant - Withholding.

corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a

section, an employer is not required to withhold Centerburg income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in Centerburg if the employee performed such services in Centerburg on 20 or
fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in

performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in
Centerburg only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in Centerburg than in any other municipal corporation on
that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent
in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was

            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in Centerburg exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to Centerburg for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in Centerburg.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for Centerburg
under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
Centerburg for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to
the employee for personal services performed in Centerburg.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is Centerburg and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
171.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to
Centerburg, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside
the corporate boundaries of Centerburg.
         To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator
with the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
171.04. (Ord. 2018-01. Passed 1-2-18.)
171.05  ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.

      (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section

      (2)    Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for Centerburg income
tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which

the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any

the case of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation,
Ohio form IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other

electronically is not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing
to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies
after the return has been filed.

      (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of Centerburg's income tax
return. The extended due date of Centerburg's income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of Centerburg's income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's Centerburg income tax return. If the request is received
by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Centerburg income tax return
is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a
Centerburg's income tax return. The extended due date of Centerburg's income
tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax

the payment of the tax imposed by Centerburg, the Tax Administrator may require
taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this
division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (5)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this

due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to Centerburg for a taxable
year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with Centerburg an

provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)    (a)    A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to Centerburg income tax ordinance for
a taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)   The person was required to file a tax return with Centerburg
for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location (as defined in Section
171.04(C)(l)(g)) within Centerburg.
            (ii)   The person no longer provides services in Centerburg and
does not expect to be subject to Centerburg income tax for the taxable year.

services or made any sales within Centerburg. The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within Centerburg, make any sales in Centerburg, or otherwise become subject to
the tax levied by Centerburg during the taxable year. If the affiant does
become subject to the tax levied by Centerburg for the taxable year, the
affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer
with Centerburg income tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The person
shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b) the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return
for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)    Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)    If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for Centerburg by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
171.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by Centerburg, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to Centerburg and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by Centerburg to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by Centerburg, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by
Centerburg or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax
return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions
of this Chapter and of Centerburg's ordinance, resolution, or rules and
regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.

States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of Centerburg

   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order

taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to Centerburg's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by a taxpayer under division (S)(1) or
(2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election is made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code
is terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code
is binding upon the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Centerburg income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to Centerburg. A taxpayer that is required to file a
consolidated Centerburg income tax return for a taxable year shall file a
consolidated Centerburg income tax return for all subsequent taxable years,
unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax
Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change
in circumstances.
   (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Centerburg income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States department of
treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
171.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated Centerburg income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section (2)(C)(1) to the
extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment
has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal
taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Centerburg income tax
return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's
net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
171.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Centerburg. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall
be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
171.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Centerburg. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall
not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's
net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
171.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Centerburg;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to Centerburg income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Centerburg income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
171.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated Centerburg income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by Centerburg in accordance with this Chapter
on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member
for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an
affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with Centerburg before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with Centerburg may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

171.07 ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for Centerburg's income tax for
the current taxable year.

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for Centerburg from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to Centerburg in equal amounts on each payment date unless
the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld,
in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the
amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
171.05 or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to Centerburg,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability
for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    For an individual, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
first month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year. For a person other than an individual, on or
before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of the taxable year,
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)    When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section 718.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
171.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
Centerburg under Section
171.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in Centerburg but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

171.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 2018-01. Passed 1-2-18.)
171.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS. 
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
171.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00 or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars ($10.00) or more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
171.21.
   
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or ninety (90) days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing
the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable
year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return
on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described
in Section
171.18 (A)(4).

171.10  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with Centerburg, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by Centerburg as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with Centerburg is subject to recovery by Centerburg. If
Centerburg's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, Centerburg
shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding Centerburg
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (C)    If Centerburg's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using
Centerburg's tax rate. However, if Centerburg's tax rate is greater than the
tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to Centerburg, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2018-01. Passed 1-2-18.)
   
171.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for Centerburg changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal
or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
Centerburg. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (a)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (b)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
171.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of
Section
171.12 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by Centerburg. A request filed under this division shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
 171.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.   
   (D)    Within sixty (60) days after the final determination of any federal
or state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Centerburg's tax liability,
that taxpayer shall make and file an amended Centerburg return showing income
subject to Centerburg income tax based upon such final determination of federal
or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Centerburg income
tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the
tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10.00).
   (E)    Unless otherwise required by law, no taxpayer shall use a different
accounting method on an amended return than the accounting method used on the
original return that the taxpayer seeks to amend. (Ord. 2018-01. Passed 1-2-
18.)
171.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and

whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and endi as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
171.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the local board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of
Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
171.09. 
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by Centerburg does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
171.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
 171.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover Centerburg income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
   (F)   All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible, together with
any interest and penalties thereon, by suit, as other debts of like amount are
recoverable. The Tax Administrator or his/her delegate is authorized, in
addition to his other duties, to institute civil lawsuits to collect delinquent
taxes due and owing the Centerburg by virtue of the provisions of this chapter.
In accordance with this Section
 171.18 of this Chapter, the Tax Administrator or his/her delegate is
authorized to assess costs of collection (including reasonable attorney's fees)
and is further authorized to waive penalties and interest and compromise tax
liability and the right to accept waiver of State statutes of limitations.

171.13 AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest (Ord. 2018-01.

change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal

shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of

Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic

address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Centerburg official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within sixty (60) days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator
under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery
is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
(60) days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other
Centerburg official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in
this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering
into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an
appeal with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2018-01. Passed 1-2-18.)
171.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to Centerburg that arises pursuant to Centerburg's income tax imposed in
accordance with this Chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2018-01. Passed 1-2-18.)
171.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of Centerburg as
authorized by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this Chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit Centerburg from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2018-01. Passed 1-2-18.)
171.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Centerburg ordinance or state law
to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of

taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         (b)    Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to Centerburg on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
Centerburg to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.

171.19  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)     Nothing in this Chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of

provided by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records,
memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         (b)    The powers referred to in this division of this section shall
be exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance
of the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under Centerburg's
income tax ordinance;
      (2)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)    Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and
states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)    Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax

provided in this Chapter;
      (5)    Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to

computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made.
         (b)    If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or

determine, or correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order
which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the
withholding obligations described in Section
 171.04.

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is

in the request.
      (2)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or
other person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is
subject to, the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by Centerburg or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty (30) days of making the request, nothing in this
Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person
to whom the request was directed pursuant to Section
171.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
171.99.
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
 171.19 within thirty (30) days after filing the next tax document requiring
such identifying information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
171.18. 
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
171.99 for a violation of Section
171.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (D)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request

bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (F)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal.

or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.

resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty (60) days of when the vacancy was

hold office for the remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax
Review shall impair the power and authority of the remaining members to
exercise all the powers of the Board of Tax Review.
      (6)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax

why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within sixty (60) days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within
sixty (60) days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at
law, certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax
Review may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties.
In such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within ninety (90) days
after the Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of
its final determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal
within fifteen (15) days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or
the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination
as provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC. (Ord. 2018-01. Passed 1-2-18.)
171.22  AUTHORITY TO CREATE RULES AND REGULATIONS. 
   Nothing in this Chapter prohibits the legislative authority of Centerburg,
or a Tax Administrator pursuant to authority granted to the administrator by
resolution or ordinance, to adopt rules to administer an income tax imposed by
Centerburg in accordance with this Chapter. Such rules shall not conflict with
or be inconsistent with any provision of this Chapter. Taxpayers are hereby

several groups of persons, or forms of income specified herein if found to be
unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such unconstitutionality, illegality or
invalidity shall affect only such clause, sentence, section or part of this

implement an income tax of Centerburg, would have been adopted had such
unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, or part hereof, not been
included therein.
   (B)    Any reference in this Chapter
171 to a statute, ordinance, or regulation (including references to the United

with any provision(s) of the Centerburg Income Tax Ordinance and the RITA Rules
& Regulations, the Ordinance will supersede. Until and if the contractual

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under

303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property. If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.
         In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this
section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the
sign.
      (2)   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this section is
taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with all of
the following:

storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains

municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.

   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the
303.082 transaction. Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the
owner or operator. Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall
move the vehicle so that the vehicle is not parked on the private property
established as a private tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the
private property or in violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.

   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,
a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.
         The towing service shall record the time and date of the photographs

to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a

the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the law enforcement agency of the
municipal corporation concerning all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;

owner, operator or lienholder of the vehicle, and requests information
pertaining to the vehicle.
   (f)   (1)   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance

who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
331.43.
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a
utility.
   
   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

(ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
 313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of- way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
 
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
            The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs
of abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall
withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant

The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
                The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the
three-day jail term under this subsection if it places the offender under a
community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three
days, requires the offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a
drivers’ intervention program so certified, and sentences the offender to a
jail term equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days that the
offender does not spend attending the program. The court may require the
offender, as a condition of community control and in addition to the required
attendance at a drivers’ intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily
complete any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum
standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental
Health and Addiction Services that the operators of the drivers’ intervention
program determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to
the court on the offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose
on the offender any other conditions of community control that it considers
necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.

this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The courtmay impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public

Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of

five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima-facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect
criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates subsection (a) of this section is guilty of driving
under suspension and shall be punished as provided in subsection (c) of this
section.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c)(2) of this section,
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. The offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

(A) of Ohio R.C. 4510.111, or Ohio R.C. 4510.11 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree and the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any

after committing the offense for which the offender is sentenced under this
section. (ORC 4510.111)
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.

jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by

constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,

   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a

101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
 
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 Type of Misdemeanor                         Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

seller from exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
 
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.

or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05 , or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05 ,
545.06 , or
545.08 ,
545.10 (b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15  or
545.20  involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05  that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05 ,
545.06  or
545.08 , Section

545.15  or
545.20 , whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the
property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all of the offenses in
the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
 
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

of the Village. At Village's option and to the extent permitted or in the

or wireless support structure proposed to be constructed, modified, collocated
on, or replaced shall constitute a separate request for consent for purposes of
tolling the response deadline as authorized under section 4939.036 of the
Revised Code. A request by a single operator for a new or replacement support
structure and associated small cell facility constitutes one request.

   (b)   A sewer service surcharge shall be applied when either or both the
total suspended solids and B.O.D. of a water or waste accepted for admission to
the Village sewage works exceeds the values of these constituents for "normal
sewage." The excess concentration in either or both, as the case may be, shall
be evaluated volumetrically in terms of "normal sewage" and be subject to
surcharge of fifteen (15) center per one hundred (100) cubic feet on the volume
derived in accordance with the following formula:
 
Sv = (Sw-2000x0.90xFx133,690  + (Bw-1667)x0.90xFx133,690,
     2000                        1667
      where Sv is the derived volume of wastes in cubic feet subject to
surcharge.
   Sw - the pounds per million gallons of suspended solids in the wastes as
discharged.
   2,000 - the pounds per million gallons of suspended solids in the "normal
sewage."
   Bw - the pounds per million gallons of B.O.D. in the wastes as discharged.
   1,667 - the pounds per million gallons of B.O.D. in "normal sewage."
   0.90 - factor allowance for 90% degree of purification required.

person with the Utility Billing Department at the Village Office. In the event
the service account is not settled in person within thirty days after service
has been terminated, then the Clerk-Treasurer shall refund the deposit, less
any unpaid charges due under this chapter, to the person who made the deposit.
All such refunds shall be sent within a reasonable time, to such person by
ordinary mail to the address listed on the application for service or to such
address that has been furnished in writing to the Utility Clerk or the Clerk-
Treasurer. In the event the refund is not claimed within a one-year period,
then the refund shall become the property of the Village and shall be deposited

imposed by the Village, State, Knox County, or other agency having
jurisdiction.
         C.   Such fees are adopted to cover the cost to the Village for
investigations, legal advertising, postage, and other expenses resulting from
the administration of planning and zoning activities.
         D.   Unless otherwise identified in the fee schedule adopted by
Village Council, no application shall be processed or determined to be complete
until the established fee has been paid.
         E.   If the Village determines that the costs on a particular
application will exceed the filing fee as established by Village Council as a
result of preparation of legal descriptions, maps, studies, or other required
information, or as a result of the need for professional expert review, study,
or testimony, the Village is authorized to collect such additional costs from
the applicant.
         F.   Application fees are not refundable, and nontransferable, except
where the Zoning Administrator determines that an application was accepted in
error, the application was withdrawn and the Zoning Administrator determines a
portion of the filing fee was not used or necessary for the review, or the fee
paid exceeds the amount due, in which case the amount of the overpayment will
be refunded to the applicant.
      (4)   Withdrawal of Application. Any request for withdrawal of an
application shall be either submitted in writing to the Zoning Administrator or
made at a meeting through a verbal request by the applicant prior to action by
the review or decision-making body.
         A.   The Zoning Administrator shall approve a request for withdrawal
of an application if it has been submitted prior to publication of notice for
the public hearing on the application in accordance with this code.
         B.   If the request for withdrawal of an application is submitted
after publication of notice for the public hearing in accordance with this
code, the request for withdrawal shall be placed on the public hearing agenda
and acted upon by the review or decision- making body.
      (5)   Reapplication after Denial of an Application. If an application is
denied, the applicant may:
         A.   Appeal the decision in accordance with the applicable appeals
procedure established in this code; or
         B.   Make changes to the application that will address all issues and
findings identified for the denial and resubmit a new application, including
any required fees. Any such resubmission shall contain a supplemental statement
that shows how the new application has substantially changed to address each of
the findings of the original decision. The Zoning Administrator shall have the
authority to determine if the evidence submitted substantially changes the
application to address all issues as part of the complete application
determination in Section
1103.06(a)(2)A. If it does not, the Zoning Administrator shall return the
application, with reasons for their determination in writing, along with any
paid fees; or
         C.   Submit the same application after a twenty-four (24)-month
waiting period; or
         D.   Submit a new application if the proposed use and design of the
site will be substantially different than the denied application.

circulation and the Village may also provide additional published notice by
electronic media including, but not limited to, posting online at the Village's
website.
            ii.   The content and form of the published notice shall be
consistent with the requirements of this section and State law.
         F.   Written (Mailed) Notice.
            i.   Written notification of property owners shall apply only to

2, the Zoning Administrator may post a sign at or near the location of the area
that is the subject of an application that is to be determined by the Village
Administrator, Planning Commission or Village Council.
            ii.   Failure of the Zoning Administrator to post a sign or to post
a sign in a specific location does not invalidate adoption of the proposed
amendment as an amending ordinance.
          H.   Constructive Notice.
            i.   Minor defects in any notice shall not impair the notice or
invalidate proceedings pursuant to the notice if a bona fide attempt has been
made to comply with applicable notice requirements. Minor defects in notice
shall be limited to errors in a legal description, typographical or grammatical
errors, or errors of actual acreage that do not impede communication of the
notice to affected parties. Failure of a party to receive written notice shall
not invalidate subsequent action. In all cases, however, the requirements for
the timing of the notice and for specifying the time, date, and place of a
hearing shall be strictly construed. If questions arise at the hearing
regarding the adequacy of notice, the decision- making body shall direct the
Zoning Administrator to make a formal finding as to whether there was
substantial compliance with the notice requirements of this code, and such
finding shall be made available to the decision-making body prior to final
action on the request.
            ii.   When the records of the Village document the publication,
mailing, and/or posting of notices as required by this chapter, it shall be
presumed that notice of a public hearing was given as required by this section.
            iii.   Failure of a newspaper to accurately or timely publish a
properly submitted notice does not invalidate adoption of the proposed
amendment as an amending ordinance.
            iv.   Failure of any property owners to receive mail notice does
not invalidate adoption of the proposed amendment as an amending ordinance.
            v.   Nothing herein shall prohibit an applicant from amending or
supplementing their application after notice has been initiated or delivered
but in sufficient time to provide such amendments or supplements to the
Planning Commission or Village Council prior to, or at the hearing.
   (d)   Meetings and Hearings.
      (1)   Pre-application Conferences or Meetings.
         A.   A prospective applicant may request a pre-application conference
with the Zoning Administrator for any review procedure in this chapter. The
applicant may request such conference by submitting a written request, along
with sufficient plans, descriptions, and other materials for the Zoning
Administrator to determine the nature and extent of the proposal.
         B.   The purpose of the pre-application conference or meeting shall be
to discuss the proposed application or project, review submittal requirements,
and discuss compliance with the provisions of this code and any Village plans
prior to the submission of an application.
         C.   After a pre-application conference, the Zoning Administrator may
(with consent of the applicant) determine to place the proposal on the agenda
of the next regularly scheduled meeting, or any special meeting, that may be
called by the applicable board for a pre-application "conceptual review." At a
conceptual review, the Planning Commission will not render a decision, but
members may voluntarily provide information and non-binding commentary
regarding the proposal documents before them.
          D.   No action can be taken by the staff and/or Planning Commission
until the applicant submits an actual application and/or plan to the Village
pursuant to the laws and policies of the Village. Therefore, all discussions
that occur between the applicant and/or applicant's representative(s) and
staff, and/or the Planning Commission, that occur prior to the date the
applicant submits an actual application and/or plan including, but not limited
to, any informal meetings with staff, the Planning Commission, any pre-
application conferences or meetings, are not binding on the Village and do not
constitute official assurances or representations by the Village or its
officials regarding any aspects or results of the plan, the procedures, or
application discussed.
      (2)   Conduct of Public Hearing.
         A.   Rights of All Persons at Public Hearings. Any person may appear
at a public hearing and submit information or evidence, either individually or
as a duly-authorized representative of a person or an organization. Each person
who appears at a public hearing shall be identified, provide their address, and
if appearing on behalf of a person or organization, state the name and mailing
address of the person or organization being represented.
         B.   Continuance of a Public Hearing or Deferral of Application
Review.
            i.   An applicant may request that a review or decision-making
body's consideration of an application at a public hearing be deferred by
submitting a written request for deferral to the Zoning Administrator. Such
request will be handled, as follows, based on the timing of receipt of such
request:
               a)   A request for deferral of consideration of an application
received prior to the publication of notice as required by this code may be
granted by the Zoning Administrator. In such cases, the application will be
considered at the next regularly scheduled meeting, or at such meeting as the
applicant requests and the Zoning Administrator approves.
               b)   A request for deferral of consideration of an application
received after publication of notice of the public hearing as required by this
code shall be presented to the Planning Commission or Village Council, as
applicable. The Planning Commission or Village Council, as applicable shall
consider the request for a continuance of the public hearing and make the
decision on continuing the hearing to another meeting at a fixed date, time,
and place provided the date, time, and place is publicly announced at the time
of continuance.
               c)   During the public meeting where there hearing is to be
held, the Planning Commission or Village Council, as applicable, or the
applicant may request the continuance of the public hearing provided such
request is made prior to a call for a vote on the application. Such continuance
shall be made to a fixed date, time, and place provided the date, time, and
place is publicly announced at the time of continuance.
             ii.   The Zoning Administrator, Mayor, or Chairperson of the
Planning Commission, as applicable, may relocate the public meeting where a
public hearing, with notice, is to be held when an emergency necessitates such
relocation or if it is determined that a large number of people are anticipated
to attend and the original location cannot safely accommodate such numbers.
Such relocation shall be noticed by the posting of a notice at the original
location of the public hearing or other notice as required by state law. The
Village Administrator or Zoning Administrator shall also endeavor to make use
of available electronic communication to further notify the public of any
relocation, to the maximum extent practical.
      (3)   Special Provisions for Adjudication Hearings. Where Section
1103.06(b)(1), notes that a public hearing is an adjudication hearing, the
Village Council or Planning Commission, as applicable, shall have the following
additional powers as part of the review of the subject application:
         A.   The Village Council or Planning Commission, as applicable, may
issue findings and conclusions which support its decisions. The findings and
conclusions shall set forth and demonstrate the manner in which the decision
carries out and helps to administer and enforce the provisions of this code
including the application of any review considerations for the subject
application.
         B.   The Village Council or Planning Commission, as applicable, may
subpoena witnesses and require the production of records.
         C.   When required by applicable law, the privilege of cross-
examination of witnesses shall be accorded all interested parties or their
counsel in accordance with the rules of the Village Council or Planning
Commission, as applicable.
      (4)   Effect of any Approvals.
         A.   No approval, decision, or order of the Zoning Administrator or
Planning Commission, appealable under this code, shall take effect until the
applicable deadline for an appeal has passed.
         B.   The issuance of any approval or permit under this code shall
authorize only the particular development, alteration, construction, or use
approved in the subject application.
         C.   All approvals shall run with the land or use and shall not be
affected by change in ownership.
      (5)   Subsequent Development.
         A.   Development authorized by any approval under this section and
this code shall not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other
approvals required by this code or any other applicable provisions of the
Village's Codified Ordinances, State law, or County law.
         B.   The granting of any approval or permit shall not guarantee the
approval of any other required permit or application.
         C.   The Village shall not be responsible for reviewing the
application for compliance with any permits, certificates, or other approvals
that may be required by Knox County, the State, or other agencies having
jurisdiction.

1103.08 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of a conditional use procedure is to allow
consideration for certain uses that due to their unique and special nature
relative to location, design, size, operations, circulation, and general impact
on the surrounding area, may be desirable and appropriate in the applicable
zoning districts but need to be evaluated on an individual basis to ensure that
potential adverse impacts of such uses are avoided or sufficiently mitigated.
   (b)   Applicability. This section shall apply to all applications for
establishment of a conditional use as may be identified in this code.
   (c)   Conditional Use Review Procedure. The review procedure for a
conditional use review shall be as follows:
      (1)   Step 1 - Pre-Application Meeting (Optional). An applicant may
request a pre-application meeting with the Zoning Administrator or Planning
Commission prior to applying for a conditional use to informally discuss the
application and any concept plans. Such meeting shall be subject to Section
1103.06(d)(1).
      (2)   Step 2 - Application. The applicant shall submit an application in
accordance with Section
1103.06: Common Review Requirements, and with the provisions of this section.
      (3)   Step 4 - Planning Commission Review and Decision.
         A.   The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the

         D.   In reviewing the application, the Planning Commission shall at a
minimum, consider the review considerations of this section.
         E.   Within ninety (90) days of the close of the public hearing, the
Planning Commission shall make a decision on the application. In making its
decision, the Planning Commission may approve, approve with modifications or
supplementary conditions, or deny the application. The Planning Commission may
extend this deadline with written agreement from the applicant.
         F.   If the Planning Commission fails to make a decision within the
ninety (90) days, or an extended timeframe approved by the applicant, the
application shall be deemed denied.
   (d)   Review Considerations. Decisions on a conditional use application may
be based on consideration of the following review considerations. All
conditional uses shall be subject to review under the considerations of this
section, as applicable, and may be subject to additional use-specific
standards.
      (1)   The proposed conditional use is established as an allowed
conditional use in the applicable zoning district;
      (2)   The proposed use is consistent with the spirit, purpose and intent
of plans and policies approved or adopted by the Village, the general purpose
of this code, and the purpose of the zoning district in which the conditional
use will be located;
      (3)   The proposed use complies with any use-specific standards as may be
established for the use;
      (4)   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety or general
welfare;
      (5)   The proposed use will comply with all applicable development
standards;
      (6)   The proposed use will be harmonious with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity, and such use will not change the essential
character of the same area;
      (7)   The conditional use will not be hazardous or disturbing to the
existing and future use and enjoyment of property in the immediate vicinity for
the uses permitted, nor substantially diminish or impair property values within
the neighborhood;
      (8)   The proposed use will not involve uses, activities, processes,
materials, equipment and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to
any person, property, or the general welfare by reason of excessive production
of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, light, glare, or odors;
      (9)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided;
      (10)   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
and egress designed to minimize traffic congestion on the surrounding public
streets; and considering the proximity of access drives to street intersections
relative to the anticipated volume of traffic.
      (11)   The design of the buildings, structures, and site will not result
in the destruction, loss or damage of a natural, scenic, or historic feature of
major importance;
      (12)   The establishment of the conditional use will not be detrimental
to the economic welfare of the community, nor shall it create excessive
additional requirements at public cost for public utilities or facilities such
as police, fire, and schools;
      (13)   There is minimal potential for future hardship on the conditional
use that could result from the proposed use being surrounded by uses permitted
by right that may be incompatible; and
      (14)   Wherever no specific areas, frontage, height, or setback
requirements are specified for a specific conditional use, then such use shall
comply with the lot and site regulations for the applicable zoning district.
   (e)   Additional Conditions, Guarantees, and Safeguards. The Planning
Commission may impose such conditions, guarantees, and safeguards as it deems
necessary to protect the general welfare and individual property rights, and to
ensure that the conditional use will meet the intent and purposes of this code.
   
   (f)   Revocation of a Conditional Use Approval.
      (1)   Whenever an approved conditional use is found in violation of any
condition, safeguard, or requirement applicable to its approval, the Zoning
Administrator shall give notice in the same manner as service of summons in
civil cases, or by certified mail to the address of the owner of record at the
premises to the address where tax bills are delivered.
      (2)   Such notice shall include the reasons the Zoning Administrator
finds the conditional use to be in violation of its approval and a statement
that the owner shall have thirty (30) days to comply with the conditions,
safeguards, or requirements applicable to the conditional use permit approval.
      (3)   Upon failure of the owner to comply with the notice, the Zoning
Administrator shall notify the Planning Commission of such violations and the
stated reasons for the noted violations.
       (4)   The Planning Commission shall review the alleged violations of the
subject conditional use at their next regularly scheduled meetings and make a
decision whether to allow for the continuance of the conditional use approval
or to revoke the conditional use approval. If the Planning Commission decides
to revoke the approval, such revocation shall be immediate and the conditional
use shall cease operation.
   (g)   Time Limit.
      (1)   A conditional use approval shall be deemed to authorize only one
particular conditional use and said permit shall automatically expire if, for
any reason, the conditional use shall cease for more than six (6) months.
      (2)   An approved conditional use permit shall expire after one year
unless the applicant submits a completed application for a zoning certificate.
      (3)   Upon expiration of a conditional use permit approval, a new
application, including all applicable fees, shall be required before a
conditional use application will be reviewed.
      (4)   Upon written request, one extension of up to one year may be
granted by the Zoning Administrator if the applicant can show good cause for a
delay.
      (5)   As part of the conditional use permit approval, the Planning
Commission may authorize alternative time limits for zoning certificate
issuance based on the scale of the proposed development.
   
   (h)   Appeals. Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by
any final action of the Planning Commission in respect to the conditional use
permit shall have the right to appeal the decision to Village Council in
accordance with Section
1103.15: Appeals to Village Council. (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1103.09 MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (a)   Purpose. The purposes of the minor subdivision process are to allow
for subdivisions of land, consolidation of lots, or transfers of a portion of a
lot to an adjacent lot where there will not be the creation of a new street,
dedication of right-of-way, or a need for any public improvements. Such
purposes are also intended to be in alignment with the platting allowances
established in ORC Chapter 711.
   (b)   Applicability.
      (1)   For the purposes of these regulations, a minor subdivision is a lot
split, lot consolidation, or transfer of land between adjacent property owners
that complies with all of the following requirements:
         A.   The subdivision shall not result in or create more than five (5)
lots, including the remainder of the original lot (e.g., four new lots and the
remainder of the original lot);
         B.   The subdivision shall be in compliance with all applicable site
development standards in this code or with any approved variance from such
standards;
         C.   All lots resulting from the minor subdivision shall have frontage
and access on an existing street and shall not require the construction,
expansion, or improvement of any street;
         D.   The subdivision shall not require any public improvements or the
dedication of rights- of-way; and
         E.   The property has been surveyed and a survey sheet or record plan,
in the form provided for in this code, and a full legal description of the
changes resulting from the split, are submitted with the application.
      (2)   A minor subdivision also includes the recombination of land,
consolidation of lots, transfer of property from one lot to an adjacent lot,
and the dedication of additional land for the widening of existing streets,
where no new lots are created.
   (c)   Minor Subdivision Review Procedure. The review procedure for a minor
subdivision shall be as follows:
      (1)   Step 1 - Application.
         A.   The applicant shall submit an application in accordance with
Section
1103.06: Common Review Requirements, and with the provisions of this section.
         B.   The application shall include a draft/proposed deed or other
instrument of conveyance in compliance with the forms prescribed by law, and
containing an accurate and current legal description based on a boundary
survey, of each proposed new lot.
         C.   If the minor subdivision involves the transfer of land area from
one lot to an adjacent lot, both property owners shall be required to authorize
the application and instruments of conveyance shall be submitted for both
resulting lots.
      (2)   Step 2 - Review and Comment by Applicable Agencies.
         A.   Upon determination that the application for a minor subdivision
is complete, the Zoning Administrator may transmit copies of the application
for review by applicable agencies including, but not limited to, the Village
Administrator and any other agencies having authority over streets, water,
sewer, gas, or other utilities and other public improvements.
         B.   Such agencies may supply comments, recommendations, and approvals
as applicable, to the Zoning Administrator for consideration prior to the
Zoning Administrator's decision (Step 3).
      (3)   Step 3 - Review and Decision by the Zoning Administrator.
         A.   Within thirty (30) days of the determination that the application
(Step 1) is complete, or within an extended timeframe approved by the
applicant, the Zoning Administrator shall review the application and approve,
approve with modifications that will bring the application into compliance with
codes, or deny the application for a minor subdivision based on the review
considerations established below. An extension on the decision may be granted
with approval from the applicant.
         B.   In reviewing the minor subdivision, the Zoning Administrator, on
recommendation of the Village Administrator, may require the addition of
easements and/or setbacks as part of a transfer of land area between two lots.
         C.   If the application is approved with modifications, the applicant
shall be required to revise all documents and resubmit for final signing by the
Village.
         D.   If the Zoning Administrator denies an application for a minor
subdivision, the Zoning Administrator shall provide the applicant with written
finding for the denial.
         E.   No zoning certificate shall be issued by the Village for any
activity on lots subject to the minor subdivision unless the revised documents
are submitted and signed by the Village and such lots are recorded (Step 4), as
approved by the Village.
      (4)   Step 4 - Recording Approved Applications.
         A.   If the application is approved, the Zoning Administrator shall
sign and date all required survey maps or legal descriptions in the minor
subdivision, or other forms of conveyance allowed by the Knox County Auditor.
          B.   Once signed by the Zoning Administrator, the applicant shall be
responsible for obtaining the signed documents and submitting to the Knox
County Auditor for the transfer of property and to the Knox County Recorder for
the recording of the lots as legal lots of record and providing a copy of said
conveyance to the Zoning Administrator, after recording.
         C.   In the case of a transfer of land between two adjacent lots, the
recording of the revised lots shall take place simultaneously.
   (d)   Review Criteria. In order for a minor subdivision to be approved, the
Zoning Administrator must determine the following:
      (1)   That the minor subdivision complies with all applicable provisions
of this code including, but not limited to, the lot and principal building
regulations of Section
1111.01;
      (2)   That any transfer between lots to be completed is not between two
lots of different zoning districts, unless the application has been
contemporaneously submitted with an application to amend the zoning map for the
parcel to be transferred, and such amendment has been approved;
      (3)   That the minor subdivision complies with all other applicable
regulations of the Village; and
      (4)   That all valid objections to the minor subdivision raised by
Village or County departments have been or will be satisfactorily resolved by
the applicant.
   (e)   Variances. If the proposed subdivision requires a variance from the
minimum lot or principal building regulations (e.g., lot area, lot width, etc.)
or other standards mandated by this code in Section
1111.01, the applicant will be required to apply for and receive variance
approvals (See Section
1103.12.) prior to approval of the minor subdivision.
   (f)   Time Limit. The minor subdivision approval shall expire six months
after the Village Administrator signs and dates the minor subdivision
conveyance unless the minor subdivision is recorded in the office of the Knox
County Recorder during said period.
   (g)   Appeals. Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by
any final action with respect to the proposed minor subdivision shall have the
right to appeal the decision to the PLANNING COMMISSION as established in
Section
1103.14.
(Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1103.10 MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS.
    (a)   Purpose. The purpose of the major subdivision process is to provide a
method of review for any subdivision that exceeds the scope of a minor
subdivision.
   (b)   Applicability. Any subdivision of land or replat of an existing
subdivision that does not meet the applicability requirements of a minor
subdivision in Section
1103.09(b), shall be subject to the requirements of this section.
   (c)   Major Subdivision Review Procedure.
      (1)   Step 1 - Pre-Application Meeting (Optional). An applicant may
request to have a pre-application meeting with the Zoning Administrator and/or
Planning Commission to informally discuss the application and any concept
plans. Such meeting shall be subject to Section
1103.06(d)(1).
       (2)   Step 2 - Application and Filling of the Preliminary Plat.
         A.   The applicant shall submit an application, including a
preliminary plat, in accordance with Section
1103.06: Common Review Requirements, and with the provisions of this section.
         B.   The preliminary plat shall be prepared, signed, and sealed by an
engineer or surveyor who is qualified and registered in the State of Ohio.
      (3)   Step 3 - Administrative Staff Review and Transmission to the
Planning Commission.
         A.   Upon determination that the application for a preliminary plat is
complete, the Zoning Administrator shall forward the application to the
Planning Commission and may transmit copies of the application for review by
applicable agencies including, but not limited to, the Village Administrator
and any other agencies having authority over streets, water, sewer, gas, or
other utilities and other public improvements.
         B.   The Zoning Administrator may consolidate any comments from the
public received in advance of the meeting and comments from the Zoning
Administrator or other departments and agencies into a report for the PC to
review as part of Step 4.
      (4)   Step 4 - Review and Decision on the Preliminary Plat by the
Planning Commission.
         A.   The Planning Commission shall review the preliminary plat
application at its next regularly scheduled meeting, or at a special meeting,
after the application is determined to be complete.
         B.   In making its decision, the Planning Commission shall approve,
approve with conditions, or deny the preliminary plat. The Planning Commission
may also continue the meeting if questions regarding the plat are not
satisfactorily addressed by the applicant.
         C.   The Planning Commission shall make a decision within sixty (60)
days of the filing of the preliminary plat (Step 2) unless the Planning
Commission and applicant agree to an extension of this time frame. If the
Planning Commission fails to act within the sixty (60) days or there is no
agreement for an extension of time, the application for a preliminary plat will
be considered approved.
         D.   If the Planning Commission denies the preliminary plat, the
applicant shall not move forward in the review process until a preliminary plat
is approved by the Planning Commission.
         E.   If the applicant proposed to construct the subdivision in phases,
the Planning Commission may approve a timeframe for filing of improvement plans
and final plats for each phase.
         F.   Approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning Commission does
not constitute approval of the subdivision, but is merely an authorization to
proceed with the preparation of the final plat and improvement plans.
      (5)   Step 5 - Submission of Improvement Plans and the Final Plat.
         A.   The applicant shall submit a final plat and related improvement
plans and specifications in accordance with Section
1103.06: Common Review Requirements. Such application shall take place within
three years following the Planning Commission's approval of the preliminary
plat unless the Planning Commission approved an alternative schedule, in which
case the applicant shall submit in accordance with the approved schedule.
Failure to submit the improvement plans within this time frame shall void the
preliminary plat approval and the applicant will be required to submit a new
application in accordance with these regulations.
          B.   The applicant shall submit the improvement plans and
specifications in accordance with any applicable board's procedural rules and
regulations and the common application requirements under Section
1103.06: Common Review Requirements, and with the provisions of this section.
         C.   If a preliminary plat has been previously approved, the final
plat shall have incorporated all changes from the preliminary plat approval.
         D.   In cases where the applicant proposes to develop the subdivision
in phases, the final plat and improvement plans shall be submitted for each
individual phase.
         E.   If the applicant proposes to provide a financial guarantee for
the public improvements in lieu of installing all public improvements prior to
approval of the final plat, the applicant shall be required to provide all
information required as part of Section
1119.05.
         F.   Upon determination by the Zoning Administrator that the final
plat has been properly submitted, the final plat shall be accepted as being
filed.
         G.   The final plat shall be prepared, signed, and sealed by an
engineer or surveyor who is qualified and registered in the State of Ohio.
      (6)   Step 6 - Administrative Staff Review of the Final Plat and
Improvement Plans.
         A.   Upon determination that the submission of the final plat and
improvement plans is complete, the Zoning Administrator may transmit copies of
the application for review by applicable agencies including, but not limited
to, the Village Administrator and any other agencies having authority over
streets, water, sewer, gas, or other utilities and other public improvements.
         B.   Such agencies shall supply comments and recommendations to the
Zoning Administrator prior to the regularly scheduled Planning Commission
meeting where the final plat and improvement plans will be subject to review.
         C.   Construction of Improvements.
            i.   Applicants shall have the choice to construct all public
improvements prior to the approval of the final plat, without a financial
guarantee, but such public improvements must be completed and then inspected
and approved by the Village Administrator before the Village can approve the
final plat. The improvements shall be constructed within a reasonable time as
determined by the Village Administrator and the Subdivider's Agreement (See
Section
1119.04.).
            ii.   All required subdivision improvements shall be maintained in
a satisfactory condition by the applicant during any interim period between
their construction and final approval and acceptance of the subdivision by the
Village. Additionally, such improvements shall be subject to maintenance
requirements following acceptance in accordance with this section and Section
1119.05.
            iii.   If the applicant requests approval of a final plat prior to
installation of the public improvements, the applicant shall be required to
provide a financial guarantee in accordance with the regulations of this code
at the time the final plat is submitted for review.
      (7)   Step 7 - Review and Decision on the Final Plat and Improvement
Plans by the Planning Commission.
         A.   The Planning Commission shall review the final plat and
improvement plans at its next regularly scheduled meeting, or at a special
meeting, after the final plat is submitted and determined to be complete.
          B.   The Planning Commission shall approve, approve with conditions,
or deny the improvement plans and final plat. The Planning Commission may also
continue the meeting if questions regarding the plat are not satisfactorily
answered by the applicant.
         C.   The Planning Commission shall make a decision within thirty (30)
days of the filing of the final plat and improvement plans (Step 5) unless the
Planning Commission and applicant agree to an extension of this time frame. If
the Planning Commission fails to act within the thirty (30) days or there is no
agreement for an extension of time, the application for a final plat will be
considered approved.
         D.   If the Planning Commission denies the final plat and/or
improvement plans, the applicant shall not move forward in the review process
until a final plat and the improvement plans are approved by the Planning
Commission.
         E.   Approval of the final plat and improvement plans by the Planning
Commission shall not be an acceptance by the public of the offer of dedication
of any street, or other public ways or open space on the final plat unless they
are accepted by Village Council in the form of the adoption of an ordinance.
         F.   At the completion of construction, and before acceptance of the
public improvements, the applicant shall furnish the Village a set of record or
"as-built" reproducible drawings as well as a digital copy that is compatible
with the Village Administrator's software showing the locations of all public
improvements including the sizes and elevations of all underground utilities.
      (8)   Step 8 - Acceptance of Improvements by Village Council. The
Village, through action by the Village Council, shall review the final plat and
consider acceptance of public improvements made by a applicant only after
meeting the following conditions:
         A.   The public improvements have been made in accordance with the
requirements of this code, and any other manuals or documents referenced in
Section
1119.03;
         B.   Installation of the public improvements has been completed in
accordance with the applicable design standards;
         C.   All final inspections required by these regulations and the
Village have been carried out by the Village, and said public improvements were
found to be acceptable by the Village Administrator.
         D.   After all public improvements have been installed to the
satisfaction of the Village, the applicant shall submit an original copy of as-
built improvement plans (showing how all public improvements were actually
installed) to the Village Administrator in a format acceptable to the Village
Administrator.
         E.   After all public improvements have been installed in accordance
with the subdivision approvals and these regulations, and the applicant has
complied with this section, the Village Council may, by ordinance, accept the
public improvements for maintenance with any applicable financial guarantee.
      (9)   Step 9 - Disposition of Approved Plat and Recordation.
         A.   All required deeds, agreements, and other required legal
instruments shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator within sixty (60)
days from the date of the Planning Commission's approval or such approval shall
thereafter be rendered null and void.
         B.   Any recorded plat which has not been approved according to the
regulations in this chapter shall be considered invalid.
         C.   The applicant shall then be responsible for submitting the signed
plat to the Knox County Recorder for the recording of the lots as legal lots of
record and providing a copy of said plat to the Village after recording.
          D.   The approval of a plat shall expire within 120 days after
Village Council approval is effective unless the plat has been duly filed and
recorded by the applicant as required by law, and the original tracing of the
plat has been filed with the Zoning Administrator.
   (d)   Review Considerations. In order to approve a major subdivision, the
Planning Commission shall consider the following:
      (1)   That the major subdivision complies with all applicable provisions
of this code;
      (2)   That the major subdivision does not conflict with other
regulations, plans, or policies of the Village;
      (3)   That the proposed subdivision is designed to be compatible with the
existing immediate or surrounding area or is in keeping with the intended
character of such area;
      (4)   That the proposed streets are in accordance with approved plans and
have been coordinated with existing streets, and that adequate measures have
been taken to provide ingress and egress so as to allow for adequate and safe
traffic flow and minimize traffic congestion in public streets;
      (5)   That the proposed subdivision will not adversely affect the
delivery of governmental services;
      (6)   That applicable review agencies have no objections that cannot be
resolved by the applicant;
      (7)   That the final plat and improvement plans conform to the approved
preliminary plat, if submitted and approved; and
      (8)   That proposed street names and addresses are easy to ascertain and
communicate for traffic safety and signage.
   (e)   Amendments of Application.
      (1)   No changes, erasures, modifications, or revisions shall be made in
any plat of a subdivision after final approval has been given by the Planning
Commission and an endorsement is made in writing on the plat, unless the plat
is first resubmitted and the changes approved by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   If the applicant finds, in the process of preparing improvement
plans, that the approved preliminary plat, if submitted, is not workable and
changes in layout are required, the applicant shall inform the Village
Administrator. The Village Administrator may require that a revised preliminary
plat be submitted for re-approval following the review procedure in Section
1103.10(c)(4), above, if the changes significantly alter the design of the
subdivision, including changes to the number of lots, modification of street
layouts, or other substantial changes. If the proposed changes are technical or
minor and do not substantively alter the approved preliminary plat, the Village
Administrator may approve the revisions. Failure to submit and receive approval
of a revised preliminary plat shall void approval of the preliminary plat and
any new submission shall be subject to a new application.
      (3)   During the final plat process, the Village Administrator is
authorized to allow minor changes related to the public improvements or design
where there is minimal impact to the overall design of the subdivision. This
limited authority shall not give the Village Administrator the authority to
vary the requirements of this code.
       (4)   If during the course of construction, any changes or modifications
are encountered that are not in conformance with the original approved
improvement plans, the applicant shall submit the modified improvement plans
(which have now become as-built drawings) to the Village Administrator, who, if
in agreement with such modifications, shall sign these drawings to indicate
approval of the modifications. If the Village Administrator does not approve
the modifications, the applicant shall be required to bring the improvements
into compliance with the approved improvement plans or the Village may utilize
the financial guarantee to correct the issue.
   (f)   Appeals. Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by
any final action of the Planning Commission for decisions on preliminary plats
or final plats shall have the right to appeal the decision to the Village
Council as established in Section
1103.15: Appeals to Village Council.
(Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1103.11 SITE PLANS.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of the site plan review procedure is to ensure

standards of this code. Zoning certificates for any building, structure,
expansions, or use of land subject to this section, shall not be issued without
an approved site plan.
   (b)   Applicability and Review Authority.
      (1)   Unless specifically exempted in Section
1103.11(c), no construction, expansion, site improvements, or demolition of a
building or structure, or use of land, buildings, or structures, shall be
permitted without the review and approval of a site plan pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   The following activities require a major site plan that shall be
reviewed by the Planning Commission prior to issuance of a zoning certificate:

with an adopted Village plan; or
         F.   A development that involves a nonconforming use, nonconforming
structure, nonconforming site, or nonconforming lot.
      (3)   All other development and activities not identified in Section
1103.11(b)(2) or exempted in Section
1103.11(c) shall require a minor site plan review that shall be reviewed and

1103.12 VARIANCES.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of a variance is to provide limited relief from
the requirements of this code in those cases where strict application of a
particular requirement will create a practical difficulty or unnecessary
hardship prohibiting the use of land in a manner otherwise allowed under this
code. It is not intended that a variance be granted merely to remove
inconveniences or financial burdens that the requirements of this code may
impose on property owners in general. Variances are intended to address
extraordinary, exceptional, or unique situations that were not caused by the
applicant's act or omission.
   (b)   Variance Review Procedure. The review procedure for a variance shall
be as follows:
      (1)   Step 1 - Application. The applicant shall submit an application in
accordance with Section

      (2)   Step 2 - Planning Commission Review and Decision.
         A.   The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing within forty-
five (45) days of the filing of the variance application provided adequate
notification is provided pursuant to Section
1103.06(c)(2).
         B.   In reviewing the application, the Planning Commission shall at a
minimum, consider the review criteria of this section.
         C.   The Planning Commission may request that the applicant supply
additional information that the Board deems necessary to review and evaluate
the request for a variance.
         D.   In making its decision, the Planning Commission may approve,
approve with modifications or supplementary conditions, or deny the
application.
         E.   In making its decision, the Planning Commission shall make
specific findings of fact based directly on the particular evidence presented
that the reasons set forth in the application and as presented by the applicant
during the public hearing, justify the approval, approval with modifications or
supplementary conditions, or denial of the variance application that will make
possible a reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.
         F.   Within sixty (60) days of the close of the public hearing, the
Planning Commission shall render a decision on the variance application unless
an extended timeframe is agreed upon by the Planning Commission and the
applicant. The Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant in writing of
the decision of the Planning Commission.
         G.   If the Planning Commission fails to make a recommendation within
the established timeframe, or an extended timeframe approved by the applicant,
the application shall be deemed approved.
         H.   In approving a variance, the Planning Commission may impose
conditions on the approval, the proposed use, and the premises to be developed
or used pursuant to such approval as it determines are required to be ensure
compliance with the standards of this section and the purpose of this code. Any
conditions established by the Planning Commission shall relate directly to the
requested variance.
         I.   Any violation of the conditions of approval shall be a violation
of this code, subject to the enforcement and penalties of Chapter
1123: Enforcement and Penalties.
 
   (c)   Review Criteria. Where an applicant is seeking a variance, the
following factors shall be considered and weighed by the Planning Commission to
determine if a practical difficulty exists that would justify approval of the
variance. However, no single factor listed below may control, and not all
factors may be applicable in each case. Each case shall be determined on its
own facts.
      (1)   Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable
generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district. Examples of
such special conditions or circumstances are exceptional irregularity,
narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot, or proximity to non-conforming
and inharmonious uses, structures or conditions;
      (2)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
      (3)   Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary to
make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures;
      (4)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
      (5)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sewer, trash pickup;
      (6)   Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of
actions of the applicant (actions of the applicant shall not include the
purchase or acquisition of the property);
      (7)   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
      (8)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance;
      (9)   Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district; and
      (10)   Whether a literal interpretation of the provisions of this code
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this code.
   (d)   Time Limit.
      (1)   The applicant shall submit a completed application for a zoning
certificate and start work within one year of the date the variance was
approved or the approval shall expire.
      (2)   Upon expiration of a variance approval, a new application,
including all applicable fees, shall be required before a variance application
will be reviewed.
      (3)   Upon written request, one extension of one year may be granted by
the Zoning Administrator if the applicant can show good cause for a delay.
      (4)   As part of the variance approval, the Planning Commission may
authorize alternative time limits for zoning certificate issuance based on the
scale of the proposed development.
   (e)   Appeals. Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by
any final action of the Planning Commission in regards to a variance
application shall have the right to appeal the decision the Village Council as
provided in Section
1103.15: Appeals to Village Council. (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
 
1103.13 ZONING CERTIFICATE.
   (a)   Purpose. A zoning certificate shall be required in accordance with the

health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the Village.
   (b)   Applicability.
      (1)   No building or other structure shall be erected, moved, altered or
added to, nor shall any building, structure or land be occupied or used, in
part or in whole, without a zoning certificate issued by the Zoning
Administrator.
      (2)   Any change in use within an existing structure or of land shall
require a zoning certificate with the exception that a change in tenancy or

      (3)   A zoning certificate may be required for the establishment of
certain temporary or accessory use as established in Chapter

Planning Commission, providing for additional standards, conditions, or
modifications, in which case, the zoning certificate shall be issued in
conformity with the provisions of those approvals, as applicable.
      (7)   Failure to obtain a zoning certificate shall be a violation of this
code subject to the provisions of Chapter
1123: Enforcement and Penalties.
   (c)   Procedures, Permits, or Certificates Subject to Similar Review. For
the purposes of this code, the zoning certificate review shall be an
administrative review that may be applied to permits or certificates of other
names (e.g., sign permits, temporary use permits, zoning occupancy permit,
etc.) if stated in this code. In such cases, the procedure of this section
shall still apply.
   (d)   Zoning Certificate Review Procedure. The review procedure for a zoning
certificate shall be as follows:

zoning certificate application as it relates to any flood-related regulations.
          C.   Within fifteen (15) days after the application is determined to
be complete, the Zoning Administrator shall make a decision either approving or

in accordance with Chapter
1113: Landscaping and Screening, the Zoning Administrator shall have thirty

demonstrate compliance within ninety (90) days of notice from the Zoning
Administrator shall be deemed a withdrawal of the application and the applicant
shall forfeit all application fees.
         E.   If the Zoning Administrator denies the application, such denial
shall be accompanied by written explanation of such denial, which shall in no
way inhibit or obligate the Zoning Administrator on any future applications.

other development approvals that may have been required by this code.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall deny any application which they
determine contains information which is clearly and demonstrably false. There
is no administrative appeal from such denial. Should the applicant file an
amended application containing correct information, it shall be treated as a
new application and the Zoning Administrator shall collect the filing fee
established by this section.
   (f)   Time Limit and Abandoned or Suspended Work.
      (1)   The applicant shall obtain an approved building permit, where
required, and begin construction, within one year of the date the zoning
certificate is approved or the approval shall be revoked. The date of approval
shall be the date the Zoning Administrator provides a signed copy of the permit
to the applicant.
      (2)   For activities that do not require a building permit, the activity
shall have been substantially begun within one year of approval and is

the Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to extend the time limits for
the start of construction and completion of construction as part of the zoning
certificate approval if the scale of the work justifies such extension.
      (6)   The Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant of the
revocation of a zoning certificate including notice that further work or use as
described in the canceled permit shall not proceed unless and until a new
zoning certificate has been obtained or extension granted.
      (7)   Upon revocation of a zoning certificate approval, a new
application, including all applicable fees, shall be required before a new

begun when all necessary excavation and piers or footings for one or more
principal buildings included in the plan shall have been completed.

revocable, if among other things, the actual development activity does not
conform to the terms of the application and permit granted thereon. The Zoning
Administrator shall have the ability to revoke such certificate in accordance

1105.03 ZONING DISTRICT MAP AND DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
    (a)   Zoning District Map.
      (1)   All land within the Village of Centerburg shall be placed into at
least one of the zoning districts established in Table 1105-1, and such zoning
shall be shown on the Zoning District Map, which may also be hereafter referred
to as the "zoning map".
      (2)   The zoning map, together with all explanatory data thereon,
including all changes thereof as hereinafter provided, shall be incorporated,
and made a part of this code, thereby having the same force and effect is if
fully described in writing.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for amending the
zoning map following approval by the Village Council and the amended map shall
be certified by the Clerk of Council.
      (4)   This code and the zoning map shall be maintained in the Village
offices and shall be available for inspection free of charge during normal
business hours.
      (5)   A copy of the zoning map and this code may be obtained from the
Village Offices. Any person requesting copies shall pay a fee in accordance
with the fee schedule adopted and approved by Village Council to defray the
cost of reproduction of the materials.
   (b)   Interpretation of Zoning District Boundaries. The boundaries of the
zoning districts are shown upon the zoning map. When uncertainty exists with
respect to the boundaries of zoning districts as shown on the zoning map, the
following rules shall apply:
      (1)   Where zoning district boundary lines are indicated as approximately
following a lot line, such lot line shall be the zoning district boundary.
      (2)   Where zoning district boundary lines are indicated as approximately
following a centerline of a street or highway, alley, railroad easement, or
other right-of-way, or a river, creek, or other watercourse, such centerline
shall be the zoning district boundary. In the event of a natural change in the
location of such streams, rivers, or other water courses, the zoning district
boundary shall be construed as moving with the channel centerline.
      (3)   Where zoning district boundary lines are indicated as approximately
following Village limits, such Village limits shall be the zoning district
boundary.
      (4)   When the actual street, right-of-way, property line boundary or
other existing ground condition is in conflict with that shown on the zoning
map, the Zoning Administrator shall provide the necessary interpretation, with
their decision appealable to the Planning Commission.
      (5)   The person contesting the location of the district boundary shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the Village and to
submit technical evidence to support their claim.
   (c)   Vacation of Public Rights-of-Way. Whenever any street, alley, or other
public way is vacated in a manner authorized by law, and where zoning was not
already interpreted as to extend to the centerline of such public right-of- way
according to subsection
1105.03(b)(2), above, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street,
alley or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of such
vacation and all areas included in the vacation shall then and henceforth be
subject to all regulations of the extended district.
   (d)   Zoning of Annexed Territory.
      (1)   All territory annexed to the Village after May 1, 2006, shall
immediately upon annexation be classified in the Estate Residential District
and shall be subject to the regulations and standards this code, unless
otherwise agreed and explicitly rezoned by Village Council in accepting said
annexation of property to the Village.
      (2)   Within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the ordinance
annexing territory to the Village, an applicant may seek a zoning map amendment
to another district in accordance with Section
1103.07.
         (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1105.04 ZONING DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENTS.
   In addition to the overall purpose of this code as established in Section
1101.01: Purpose, the following are the purpose statements for the individual
zoning districts in the Village of Centerburg, Ohio. The purpose of Planned
Development Districts is set out in Section
1107.01.
   (a)   Estate Residential District (ER). The purpose of the Estate
Residential District (ER) is to provide a transition between more rural areas
of the Village of Centerburg and adjacent jurisdictions, and more urbanized
portions of the Village. These areas may or may not be served by public
utilities yet but are still expected to develop at a lower density.
   (b)   Single-Family Residential District (R-1). The purpose of the Single-
Family Residential District (R-1) is to encourage and provide for the orderly
development of primarily low-density single-family homes and customary
supporting residential facilities, such as schools, churches, parks, and open
spaces.
   (c)   Single-Family Residential District (R-2). The purpose of the Single-
Family Residential District (R-2) is to provide for the orderly development of
primarily moderate-density single-family homes and customary supporting
residential facilities, such as schools, churches, parks, and open spaces.
   (d)   Multi-Family Residential District (R-3). The purpose of the Multi-
Family Residential District (R-3) is to encourage and provide for the orderly
development of moderate density detached and attached housing types, with
multiple dwelling units per structure, as well as the customary supporting
residential facilities, such as schools, churches, parks, and open spaces. It
is furthermore the purpose of this district to ensure that the location of such
uses are in close proximity to community services and major thoroughfares that
lend themselves to effective integration into the neighborhood by location and
function.
   (e)   Community Commercial District (CC). The purpose of the Community
Commercial District (CC) is to accommodate primarily commercial business,
personal, professional and roadway service uses that cater to the needs of both
the regional and local market. Development standards for single, free-standing
uses on individual lots and shopping centers are regulated separately to
encourage consolidation of lots into shopping centers of five acres or more.
   (f)   Village Center District (VC). The purpose of the Village Center
District (VC) is to preserve, protect, and promote the Village- scale central
commercial environment through promotion of and limitation to Village-scale
commercial pursuits developed in a manner that is pleasant, safe, and
convenient, the promotion of adaptive reuse of older commercial structures, and
those constructed originally as residences, for appropriate village-scale
commercial purposes, retention of the village scale and character through the
limitation of uses, use sizes and characteristics, provision for the
realization of a fine-grained intermixture of small-scale residential, office,
and retail uses that was the hallmark of village life, and minimization of the
impact of provisions for auto parking on loss of community character.
    (g)   Residential Office and Services District (RO). The purpose of the
Residential Office and Services District (RO) is to provide for a transitional
area of uses along major thoroughfares that are occupied by older single-family
residences, but are subject to development pressure for commercial and office
uses. The intent of the district is to provide for small low-intensity
administrative and professional offices as an alternative use in such areas,
while preserving the area's residential character.
   (h)   Industrial District (ID). The purpose of the Industrial District (ID)
is to provide suitable areas for industrial activities. Uses developed within
this district are intended to maintain an environment relative to noise, odor,
dust, smoke, light, glare, or vibration that is compatible with adjacent land
uses and in compliance with applicable State and Federal environmental
regulations. Uses within this district are intended to operate without imposing
any unusual burdens upon utility or government services.
   (i)   Public and Institutional District (P-I). The purpose of the P-
I District is to establish sites for various governmental, institutional,
educational, recreational, or other public or quasi-public uses that are
integral parts of the community while also ensuring compatibility with the
surrounding neighborhoods.
      (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1105.05  ALLOWED PRINCIPAL USES.
   (a)   Table 1105-2 lists the principal uses allowed within the various
zoning districts, except for uses allowed in PD Districts, which are
established in Chapter
1107: Planned Developments.
   
   (b)   Explanation of Table of Allowed Permitted Uses.
      (1)   Permitted Uses.
         A.   A "P" in a cell indicates that a use type is allowed by-right in
the respective zoning district. Permitted uses are subject to all other
applicable standards of this code.
         B.   Permitted uses are approved administratively by the Planning
Commission through the site plan review process or by the Zoning Administrator
through the zoning certificate procedure, unless subject to additional reviews
(e.g., variance, etc.).
      (2)   Permitted Uses with Standards.
         A.   A "PS" in a cell indicates that a use type is allowed by-right in
the respective zoning district if it meets the additional standards as
identified in the last column of Table 1105-2. Permitted uses with standards
are subject to all other applicable standards of this code.
         B.   Uses permitted with standards are approved administratively by
the Planning Commission through the site plan review process or by the Zoning
Administrator through the zoning certificate procedure, unless subject to
additional review (e.g., variance, etc.).
         C.   Where Planning Commission or the Zoning Administrator determine
that such standards have not been met, such determinations are subject to
appeal in accordance with Section
1103.14, or the applicant may submit the same or substantially similar
information under an application for a variance pursuant to Section
1103.12 or a conditional use pursuant to Section
1103.08.
      (3)   Conditional Uses.
         A.   A "C" in a cell indicates that a use may be permitted if approved
by the Planning Commission through the conditional use review procedure.
Conditional uses may be subject to use-specific standards as identified in the
last column of Table 1105-2. Conditional uses are subject to all other
applicable standards of this code.
          B.   The existence or lack of additional use-specific standards in
this code shall not be implied to be the only standards the use is required to
meet. Any conditional use listed in the table shall be subject to the general
review standards for all conditional uses established in Section
1103.08(d).
         C.   Where a use is listed as P/C or PS/C, there may be certain
circumstances in which a conditional use approval may be required rather than
the use being permitted or permitted with standards. The specific approval
required shall be as established in the use-specific standards.
      (4)   Prohibited Uses.
         A.   A blank indicates that a use is prohibited in the respective
zoning district.
         B.   Any use not specifically listed shall be considered prohibited
unless allowed in accordance with Section
1105.05(d), below.
         C.   The cultivation of medical marijuana, or the processing or retail
dispensing of medical marijuana product within the Village is hereby
specifically prohibited.
            i.   This section does not prohibit research related to marijuana
conducted at a state university academic medical center, or private research
and development organization as part of a research protocol approved by an
institutional review board or equivalent entity, if otherwise permitted under
Chapter 3796 of the Ohio Revised Code and any administrative rules promulgated
thereunder.
            ii.   Nothing herein is intended to regulate or prohibit a
physician from recommending medical marijuana for a qualifying medical
condition, or a registered patient from possessing or using medical marijuana
as permitted under Chapter 3796 of the Ohio Revised Code and any administrative
rules promulgated thereunder.
      (5)   Use-Specific Standards.
         A.   The numbers contained in the "Use-Specific Standards" column are
references to additional standards and requirements that apply to the use type
listed. Standards referenced in the "Use-Specific Standards" column apply in
all zoning districts unless otherwise expressly stated.
         B.   Use-specific standards shall only apply if the use is permitted
with standards (PS) or a conditional use (C). If the use is permitted with
standards in some districts and conditional in other districts, the use-
specific standards shall apply to both the districts where it is permitted with
standards and where it is conditionally permitted.
         C.   This section provides site planning, development, and/or
operating standards for certain land uses that are permitted with standards or
conditionally permitted in Table 1105-2.
         D.   The land uses and activities covered by this section shall comply
with the applicable use-specific standards in all districts unless otherwise
specified, in addition to all other applicable provisions of this code.
   (c)   Multiple Uses. If multiple uses are proposed on a single lot or in a
single building then each of the individual uses has to be allowed in the
applicable zoning district and reviewed in accordance with how the individual
use is allowed in the district (i.e., permitted, permitted with standards, or
conditional use).
   (d)   Use Determination and Unlisted Uses.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator shall make the determination if a proposed
use is permitted, permitted with standards, a conditional use, or a prohibited
use under the provisions of this section.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator may determine that a proposed use that is
not already listed in this code is substantially similar to a use that is
permitted, permitted with standards, or a conditional use established in Table
1105-2 based on the proposed use activities, character of the business,
similarity to existing uses within the Village, or any other relevant
information from reliable sources. If the Zoning Administrator finds that the
proposed use is substantially similar to a use established in Table 1105-2, the
application shall be processed in the same manner as the similar use.
      (3)   In finding that a proposed use is similar to a use established in
Table 1105-2, the Zoning Administrator shall make a note of the similar use in
the approved application form.
      (4)   If the Zoning Administrator makes the determination that a use is
prohibited, the application shall not be processed, and the application fee
shall be returned.
      (5)   If the applicant disagrees with the Zoning Administrator's
determination regarding the proposed use, the applicant may choose to take one
of the following actions:
         A.   The applicant may appeal the determination of the Zoning
Administrator to the Planning Commission pursuant to Section
1103.14: Appeals; or
         B.   The applicant may present their case to the Planning Commission
and/or Village Council to request that the Village initiate a text amendment to
address the proposed use and applicable standards.

CHAPTER 1107
Planned Developments
1107.01   Purpose.
1107.02   Intent.
1107.03   Planned development review procedure.
1107.04   Enforcement.
1107.05   Permitted uses.
1107.06   Development standards.
1107.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of the Planned Development (PD) District is to provide a
means for encouraging ingenuity, imagination, and flexibility in the planning
and designing of land areas. The PD provides a controlled flexibility by
utilizing objectives and performance standards rather than rigid development
standards, the intent being to encourage developments which possess greater
amenities than that resulting under standard zoning district requirements.
   (b)   It is not the intent of the PD to allow applications to circumvent the
intent of this code to permit residential density, housing types, commercial or
industrial uses, or street and utility layouts that conflict with adopted
village plans and policies or the character of the area.
   (c)   It is furthermore the purpose of the PD regulations to:
      (1)   Allow for creative and high-quality developments that are
compatible with surrounding land uses and contribute to the overall quality of
the Village of Centerburg;
      (2)   Encourage creative transit scenarios oriented towards pedestrians
or other alternative forms, which is safe and efficient for both vehicular and
pedestrian travel.
      (3)   Protect natural features such as topography, trees, and drainage
ways in the existing state as much as possible;
      (4)   Provide for appropriate, adequate and usable open space where there
is a residential component to the proposed PD;
      (5)   Ensure that there are adequate services and infrastructure to serve
the proposed development and not decrease the services or infrastructure for
existing uses; and
      (6)   Promote a harmonious design among the various elements and uses
within the development while mitigating any potential negative impact on
surrounding properties.
         (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1107.02 INTENT.
   (a)   The intent of the PD regulations is to provide a means for applying
comprehensive and flexible planning and design techniques on properties
substantially sized to accommodate such a plan. PD proposals shall not be
applied to small areas as a means of bypassing traditional district
regulations.
   (b)   The applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating that the proposed
development, development size, and overall approach is reflective of the
purpose for PDs, established above, and the review considerations incorporated
into this chapter. Furthermore, the applicant shall demonstrate how the
proposed development will help implement plans and policies adopted by Village
Council. (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1107.03 PLANNED DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   (a)   In order to submit an application for PD review, the lot(s) included
within the proposed PD shall be under a single ownership or control, or shall
be subject to a joint application by the owners of all property included within
the proposal.
   (b)   PD Review Procedure.
      (1)   Step 1 - PD Preliminary Plan and Zoning Map Amendment.
         A.   The PD Preliminary Plan approval procedure involves a zoning map
amendment to rezone the subject property to a PD District with an approved PD
Preliminary Plan and a PD Development Standards Document.
         B.   The PD Preliminary Plan shall include all maps and materials as
may be established and required by the Zoning Administrator or Planning
Commission in accordance with Section
1103.06(a)(2).
          C.   The PD Development Standards Document shall include and
information that will demonstrate that the project meets the intent for a PD,
as established in Section
1107.02, above. Additionally, the PD Development Standards document will
establish the zoning standards that shall apply to lots and uses within the PD
including minimum lot areas, setbacks, building heights, lot coverages, etc.
Additional information may be included based on the requirements of the Zoning
Administrator or Planning Commission in accordance with Section
1103.06(a)(2).
         D.   The procedure for this step shall comply with the requirements of
Section
1103.07.
         E.   In accordance with the zoning map amendment review procedure, the
Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing to review the PD Preliminary
Plan and PD Development Standards Document, and make a recommendation to
Village Council to approve, approve with modifications, or deny the
application. The recommendation shall be made based on review of the
application using the criteria contained in Section
1107.03(d).
         F.   In accordance with the zoning map amendment review process, the
Village Council shall hold a public hearing on the PD Preliminary Plan, PD
Development Standards Document, and zoning map amendment and decide to approve,
approve with modifications, or deny the application using the criteria
contained in Section
1107.03(d). If the application is approved, the area of land involved in the
application shall be rezoned as an PD with a related, approved PD Preliminary
Plan and PD Development Standards Document.
         G.   In making its recommendations or decisions, the Planning
Commission and/or Village Council may impose such conditions of approval as are
in its judgment necessary to insure conformity to the applicable criteria and
standards of this code and with approved village plans.
      (2)   Step 2 - PD Development Plan Review.
         A.   Within two years after the approval of the PD Preliminary Plan
and PD Development Standards Document, the applicant shall file a PD
Development Plan for the entire development, or when submitting in phases, for
the first phase of the development.
         B.   Upon determination by the Zoning Administrator that the PD
Development Plan application is complete, such plans shall be submitted to the
Planning Commission for review at its next regularly scheduled meeting, or at a
special meeting.
         C.   The Planning Commission will review the PD Development Plan to
determine whether it substantially conforms to the previously approved PD
Preliminary Plan, PD Development Standards Document, and to all other
applicable standards of this code. If the Planning Commission determines that
there have been major changes from the PD Preliminary Plan or PD Development
Standards Document, then the Planning Commission shall have the authority to
forward the PD Preliminary Plan and PD Development Standards Document to
Village Council for a decision. Major changes are defined pursuant to Section
1107.03(e).
          D.   If more than two years passes from the date of approval of the
PD Preliminary Plan and PD Development Standards Document, and the PD
Development Plan has not been submitted, the PD Preliminary Plan and PD
Development Standards Document shall be deemed expired and shall be of no
further force and effect. After the PD Preliminary Plan and PD Development
Standards Document have expired, the PD zoning designation shall remain in
place, but no development shall be authorized unless the property owner, or
authorized agent, submits a new application for a PD Preliminary Plan and PD
Development Standards Document for review pursuant to this article, or applies
for a zoning map amendment to another zoning district. The Planning Commission
or Village Council may also initiate a zoning map amendment after the
expiration of a PD Preliminary Plan and PD Development Standards Document.
         E.   Preliminary subdivision plat review may occur concurrently with
the PD Development Plan approval.
         F.   An applicant shall submit a PD Development Plan for review. The
application shall be subject to the common review requirements of Section
1103.06 and the required fee shall be submitted, as established in the Village
of Centerburg fee schedule.
         G.   The Planning Commission shall hold a public meeting on the PD
Development Plan and decide to approve, approve with modifications, or deny the
application using the criteria contained in this chapter.
         H.   In its decision, the Planning Commission may impose such
conditions of approval as are in its judgment necessary to ensure conformity to
the applicable review considerations and standards. In so doing, the Planning
Commission may table any action until the applicant presents revised plans the
reflect such conditions. In making a motion to table the action, the Planning
Commission may establish a deadline for the submission of such revisions, with
a minimum of sixty (60) days provided. Failure to comply with any deadlines
shall result in the Planning Commission making a decision to deny the
application or allowing for a time extension for good cause shown.
   (c)   Time Limits for the PD Final Plan.
      (1)   Any PD Development Plan shall be valid for a period of five (5)
years after the date of approval by the Planning Commission. If no development
has begun (development being defined as the start of construction of the
required public/private improvements as shown on the approved PD Development
Plan for one or more phases of the project) in the PD within five years from
the date of approval, such approval of the PD Final Plan shall lapse and be of
no force and effect.
      (2)   If an approved PD Development Plan lapses as provided in Paragraph
(1) above, the originally approved PD Preliminary Plan shall also be considered
void.
      (3)   Voiding of the PD Preliminary, PD Development Standards Document,
and PD Development Plans shall not rezone the property. After such plans are
voided, the Planning Commission, the Village Council, or property owners may
initiate a rezoning to another zoning district in accordance with Section
1103.07 or the property owner, or their agent, may resubmit a new PD
Preliminary Plan and PD Development Standards Document in accordance with the
procedures of this chapter.
   (d)   PD Review Considerations. All PD applications shall be reviewed based
on the following general considerations and the applicable review body shall
consider such considerations in the creation of their recommendations and
decisions regarding PD applications:
      (1)   The proposed development is in conformity with all applicable,
adopted Village plans;
      (2)   The proposed development meets the intent and spirit of this code
and all other applicable Village ordinances;
       (3)   The development provides an environment of stable character that
promotes a harmonious relationship between land uses within the site and a
harmonious relationship with surrounding development, utilizing adequate
buffers where necessary;
      (4)   The proposed development provides a development pattern which
preserves and utilizes the natural topography, geologic features, scenic
vistas, natural vegetation and natural drainage patterns of the site;
      (5)   The proposed development promotes the opportunity for privacy
within residential areas and minimizes nuisances between residential areas and
other land uses;
      (6)   The proposed development does not impose an undue burden on public
services and facilities such as fire and police protection, schools, water
supply and wastewater disposal due to excessive population densities;
      (7)   The proposed development is accessible from public thoroughfares
adequate to accommodate the traffic which shall be imposed on them by the
proposed development, and the proposed streets and parking areas within the
site are adequate to serve the proposed arrangement of land uses;
      (8)   The proposed development minimizes pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicle
conflicts;
      (9)   The proposed development provides a higher quality and more useful
design of landscaping and open space and amenities than would normally be
required under the strict application of existing requirements in this code;
      (10)   The PD plans have been transmitted to all other agencies and
departments charged with responsibility of review and any identified issues
have been reasonably addressed by the applicant;
      (11)   Where common open space is provided, appropriate arrangements with
the applicant have been made which will ensure the reservation of common open
space as indicated on the PD Development Plan, Adequate provision shall be made
for the long-term maintenance and/or operation of the open space and its
improvements, as follows:
         A.   The proposed common open space may be conveyed to a public
authority which agrees to maintain the common open space and any buildings,
structures or improvements which have been placed on it. All land dedicated to
the public shall meet the requirements of the appropriate authority as to size,
shape and location. Public utility or other similar easements and rights of way
for water course, other similar channels or for storm drainage facilities are
not acceptable for common open space dedication unless such land or right of
way is usable as a trail or other similar purpose and approved by the authority
to which the land is dedicated;
         B.   The proposed open space may be conveyed to the trustees of a
Homeowners Association or similar organization formed for the maintenance of
the planned development. The common open space may be conveyed by covenants
under such an arrangement subject to approval by the Planning Commission. Such
covenants shall restrict the common open space to the uses specified on the
final development plan and provide for the maintenance of common open space in
a manner which assures its continuing use for its intended purpose.
   (e)   Modifications to Approved PDs.
      (1)   Where a lot owner on a lot in a PD seeks a variance from the
applicable standards for an individual lot that will not apply to any other lot
in the PD, the property owner shall request such variance in accordance with
Section
1103.12.
      (2)   Any request to change or otherwise modify the approved PD
Development Plan as it applies to more than one lot owner, shall be reviewed
based on whether the change is considered major or minor, in accordance with
this subsection.
       (3)   Major Change. Major changes to a PD require the prior approval of
the Planning Commission and the Village Council. The Planning Commission shall
have the authority to determine if a proposed change is a major change. Such
changes include, but are not limited to:
         A.   Expansion of the PD project beyond the original tract coverage;
         B.   Removal or subtraction of land from the original tract coverage;
         C.   Proposed changes that will result in an increase in residential
density;
         D.   Changes to the list of uses allowed in the PD;
         E.   Changes in the development plan relative to the size and
arrangement of buildings, the layout of streets or circulation patterns, the
size, configuration and location of common open space, and changes in any
approved elements of the PD; and
         F.   Amendments to the conditions that were attached to the PD
development plan approval.
      (4)   Minor Changes.
         A.   Minor changes are those proposed by the applicant/owner which do
not disturb or affect the basic design and approved PD Development Plan and
which are essentially technical in nature, as determined by the Planning
Commission.
         B.   Examples of minor changes include, but are not limited to, change
in the intensity of lighting, changes in the size and location of water and
sewer lines within approved easements and changes in the location and number of
fire hydrants.
            (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1107.04 ENFORCEMENT.
   Failure to comply with the approved plan or any prescribed conditions or
approval, including failure to comply with the stage development schedule,
shall be considered a violation of this code, subject to Chapter
1123: Enforcement and Penalties.
(Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1107.05 PERMITTED USES.
   (a)   Principal Uses.
      (1)   The applicant shall include a list of uses that are proposed for
the PD as part of the PD Preliminary Plan and PD Development Standards Document
review. This list shall include a list of any uses that may be added at a later
late (i.e., any use that could replace another if an original use is
discontinued). Only those uses listed therein as a permitted use, whether
permitted as-of-right, permitted with standards, or permitted as a conditional
use, may be considered in the application of a PD. As part of any approval, the
Planning Commission and/or Village Council may restrict the uses proposed by
the applicant within an individual PD by adopting a revised list of uses
permitted within the PD.
      (2)   In general, any standards that apply to a specific use in this code
shall also apply to those same uses in a PD. However, the Planning Commission
and Village Council may adjust or waive any of those use-specific standards
(See Section
1105.06.) based on unique circumstances specific to the applicable development
such waiver is reviewed based on the review considerations of Section
1107.03(d).
      (3)   Any changes in uses within an approved PD shall be required to be
reviewed as part of a major PD amendment.

CHAPTER 1109
Accessory and Temporary Uses
1109.01   Accessory use and structure regulations.
1109.02   Temporary use regulations.
1109.01 ACCESSORY USE AND STRUCTURE REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Purpose. This section authorizes the establishment of accessory uses
and structures that are incidental and customarily subordinate to principal
uses. The intent of this section is to allow a broad range of accessory uses
while not creating adverse impacts on surrounding lands.
   (b)   General Provisions.
      (1)   An accessory use or structure shall be secondary and incidental to
the primary use of the lot and shall not alter the character of the principal
use.
      (2)   Accessory uses and structures shall be constructed on the same lot
as the principal use that it serves.
      (3)   No accessory structure shall be constructed on any lot until the
construction of the principal structure has commenced.
      (4)   In cases where the principal building is demolished, an existing
accessory structure shall be allowed to remain on the lot or property without
the principal building to which it is supposed to be an accessory on the
following conditions:
         A.   Up to twelve (12) months consistent with that allowed by Chapter
1121: Nonconformities.
         B.   A zoning certificate is obtained for the reconstruction of the
principal structure, the construction of which shall take place within twelve
(12) months. Failure to complete reconstruction of the principal structure will
be an automatic cause for the removal of the accessory structure at the owner's
expense unless cause is given, in which case the Zoning Administrator may
approve an extension of up to twelve (12) months.
      (5)   Small accessory structures such as doghouses, lending libraries,
benches, garden decorations, barbeque equipment, etc. that are not otherwise
addressed in this chapter, shall be exempt from the provisions of this section
provided they do not have a footprint that exceeds 100 square feet and shall
not exceed six (6) feet in height. Such structures shall only be permitted in
the side or rear yard.
      (6)   No outdoor storage is permitted in any residential district other
than wood, intended for the personal use of household residents in a fireplace
or wood stove.
      (7)   An accessory structure that is attached to the principal building
shall be considered an integral part of the principal building and shall comply
with the site development standards and all other development standards of the
applicable zoning district that apply to the principal building. Any accessory
structure shall be considered as an integral part of the principal building if
it is connected to the principal building either by common walls or by a
breezeway or roof.
      (8)   All accessory buildings and structures shall be maintained in good
condition and kept secure from the deteriorating effects of natural elements.
      (9)   No accessory structure may be used for temporary or permanent
habitation unless approved as an accessory dwelling unit in accordance with
this chapter.
   (c)   Prohibited Structures for Accessory Uses.
      (1)   Accessory structures that are constructed with fabric, canvas,
tarpaulin, or other similar materials shall be prohibited unless approved as a
temporary use or unless the accessory structure is permanent but the cover,
canopy, etc., is removed for at least one season each calendar year, in which
case, such materials must be maintained in good condition. Inflatable garages
or storage structures shall also be prohibited.
      (2)   Portable containers, shipping containers, and semi-tractor trailers
used for storage (with or without wheels) shall not be used as permanent
accessory structures in any zoning district.
 
   (d)   Permitted Accessory Uses. The following is an explanation of Table
1109-1.
      (1)   The symbols for permitted uses with standards (PS), conditional
uses (C), and prohibited are defined in the same manner as Section
1105.05(b).
      (2)   A blank cell indicates that a use is prohibited in the respective
zoning district.
      (3)   Zoning Certificate Required. A "Yes" in the "Zoning Certificate
Required" column shall mean that the applicable accessory structure or use
requires a zoning certificate in order to be constructed.
      (4)   Use-Specific Standards. The numbers contained in the "Use-Specific
Standards" column are references to additional standards and requirements that
apply to the listed accessory use or structure. Standards referenced in the
"Use-Specific Standards" column apply in all zoning districts unless otherwise
expressly stated.
      (5)   Similar Use Determination and Unlisted Uses. The determination of
whether a proposed accessory use or structure is permitted, permitted with
standards, a conditional use, or a prohibited use under the provisions of this
section shall be made in the same manner as principal uses. See Section
1105.05(d).

   (d)   Filing Complaints, Inspections.
      (1)   All complaints alleging the existence of a public nuisance shall be
filed with the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall promptly inspect the premises or
cause them to be inspected and shall make a written report of the findings of
the inspection. Whenever practical, photographs of the premises shall be
attached to the written report. The Zoning Administrator shall keep all such
written reports on file in accordance with the Village's records retention
policy.
   
   (e)   Notice to Abate.
      (1)   Upon determining that a public nuisance exists on a property and
that there is a great and immediate danger to the public health and safety, the
Zoning Administrator shall cause written notice to be served upon the owners,
in accordance with this Section
1111.07(e).
      (2)   The notice shall state the nature of the nuisance by identifying
the conditions and may cite relevant code provisions, and further state that
unless such nuisance is so abated or removed, the cost thereof will be charged
to the owner, occupant or person causing, permitting or maintaining the
nuisance and such cost shall be a lien on the real property where the nuisance
was abated or removed.
      (3)   Such notice shall also state that the failure of such owner,
occupant or person to abate the nuisance shall be deemed an implied consent for
the Village to abate or remove such nuisance.
      (4)   If the public nuisance does not constitute a great and immediate
danger to the public health, safety or welfare, the Zoning Administrator may
serve the owner or occupant of such premises or the person in whose name such
real estate was last billed for property tax purposes a notice to demand the
abatement or removal of the violation within fifteen (15) days of the date set
forth in the notice. Service may be had by certified mail or personal service;
or by posting the notice on the property and mailing the notice by first class
mail.
      (5)   The notice to abate shall contain a statement as to the right to
request an opinion and the date and time upon which such right shall expire.
   (f)   Request for Opinion.
      (1)   The property owner, lessee, agent, tenant, or person having charge
or care of the subject land may appeal the determination of nuisance to the
Planning Commission as provided in Section
1103.14.
      (2)   The written appeal must be made within the time period in which to
abate the nuisance stated in the notice. This appeal must be submitted, in
writing, and shall describe the reasons why the property is not a nuisance. The
Planning Commission may extend the time in which the nuisance must be abated,
determine that a nuisance does not or no longer exists, or that the nuisance
must be abated within the time period set out in the notice or immediately if
the period set out in the notice has run. Provided, however, that if the
nuisance was determined to be an emergency and that the opportunity for an
appeal was not available due to the short period of time to abate the nuisance,
an appeal may be heard after the abatement of the nuisance by the Village. In
that event, the Planning Commission may determine that the appellant is not
liable for the costs, or that, upon good cause shown, a lien shall not be filed
by the Village upon the property.
   (g)   Procedure When Owner Fails to Comply.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator may determine that the public nuisance for
which a notice has been issued under Section
1111.07(e) constitutes a public nuisance pursuant to Section
1111.07(b) and that the person having charge or care of the land has failed to
comply with the notice within the time specified in the notice.
       (2)   The Zoning Administrator or his designee may cause the abatement
of such public nuisance by use of Village force and equipment or by the hiring
of private contractors. The reasonable cost thereof shall be a lien on the real
property where the nuisance was abated or removed less any monies accruing to
the Village from disposal of abated nuisances.
      (3)   See Section
1111.07(i), below related to the payment of costs and the procedure for the
placement of a lien on the property.
   (h)   Statement of Cost. Upon completion of abatement of the nuisance, the
Zoning Administrator shall determine the cost of abatement and shall cause a
statement thereof to be mailed to the owner of the land. Such statement of
costs shall include:
      (1)   Village equipment charge;
      (2)   Village equipment operator charge;
      (3)   Equipment transportation charge;
      (4)   Administration and supervision charge;
      (5)   Removal charge;

      (8)   Any attorneys' fees or other costs.
      
   (i)   Payment of Cost.
      (1)   The owner shall pay such costs as are charged in accordance with
this section to the Clerk-Treasurer within thirty (30) days after the statement
of charges has been mailed to the owner at the address of record in the office
of the County Treasurer.
      (2)   Such payments shall be credited to the appropriation from which
such cost was paid by the Village.
      (3)   If the charge is not paid within thirty (30) days after mailing,
the Clerk-Treasurer shall certify the charges for services as provided in
Section
1111.07(g) to the County Auditor, together with a proper description of the
premises.
      (4)   Such amounts shall be entered upon the tax duplication, shall be a
lien upon such lands from the date of the entry, and shall be collected as
other taxes and returned to the Village with the General Fund pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 731.54. (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1111.08 SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS (SFH).
   (a)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to promote and provide for
the proper use and development of lands subject to periodic flooding and to
encourage the development of such lands in a manner that will promote the
public health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the Village. The
intent of this section is to secure safety from flooding, minimize flood damage
to persons and property, minimize public expenditures for flood relief and
flood control projects, and to reduce the height and violence of floods insofar
as such are caused by any natural or artificial obstruction. In order to
accomplish its purposes, this section includes methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety and property due to flooding, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion, in flood heights or in flood water velocity;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of the floodplain, watercourse channels
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
       (4)   Controlling the filling, grading, dredging and other development
which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the creation of floodway obstructions or
encroachments which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase
flood hazards in other areas.
   (b)   Basis for Establishing the Floodplain. To secure this degree of safety
from flooding and damages of flooding, the objectives of this section are to
assure the retention of sufficient natural floodway area to convey flood flows;
to designate a minimum flood protection elevation; to reduce the height and
violence of floods insofar as such are increased by any encroachment or flood
obstruction:
      (1)   The floodplain constitutes two (2) special flood hazard areas which
are hereby established for and effective in the floodway and floodway fringe of
the Village and which shall be subject to the regulations of this section. The
floodway and the floodway fringe areas are detailed on the flood profile and
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) contained in the Flood Insurance Study and are
subject to the provisions of this section.
      (2)   These two areas distinguish between:
         A.   The hazards to life and property associated with that portion of
the floodplain required to carry and discharge the waters of a base flood (the
floodway area) and
         B.   The remaining portion of the floodplain that is subject to
inundation during a base flood (the floodway fringe area).
      (3)   The regulations of this section shall be construed as being
supplementary to the regulations imposed on the same lands by virtue of the
land being part of a zoning district. It is not intended by this section to
repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way impair or interfere with existing
provisions of other laws or ordinances, except those specifically repealed by
this section. However, where this section imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this section shall prevail.
      (4)   It shall be the intent of this section to use the most current data
available for identifying the floodplain, floodway, and floodway fringe. Such
data may be supplied by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Federal
Emergency Management Agency or an approved technical institute or governmental
agency. Consideration shall be given to an engineer-certified specific site
survey and study which presents detailed elevation information which is not
otherwise available.
   (c)   Delineation Of Floodway and Floodway Fringe Areas.
      (1)   The selection of the floodway area shall be based on the principle
that the area chosen for the floodway must be sufficient to carry the waters of
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood
more than one-half foot at any point within the watercourse or an affected
watercourse reach. This floodway area designation is established on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
      (2)   The landward boundary of the floodway fringe area shall be that of
the base flood. The channelward boundary of the floodway fringe area shall be
that of the abutting floodway.
   (d)   Availability of Maps Delineating the Floodplain.
      (1)   The Village shall make available and maintain information as to the
floodplain which will provide descriptive data delineating the floodway and
floodway fringe area boundaries along the major watercourses within the Village
by which the location of individual properties can be determined in relation to
the floodplain.
      (2)   Where a watercourse meanders through or extensively borders a given
subdivision or other parcel of land resulting in varying flood elevations, the
highest flood elevation affecting a given parcel of land may be used to
determine a flood protection elevation for the entire parcel or subdivision.
   (e)   Permitted Uses in the Floodway.
      (1)   Within a floodway area, no buildings or structures shall be used
and no buildings or structures shall be erected, constructed, altered, or
enlarged for any purpose and no premises shall be used which are arranged,
intended or designed to be used for other than one of the following uses as
permitted by the underlying zoning district.
         A.   Agricultural use;
         B.   Public or private recreational use;
         C.   Public or private water-oriented facility for recreational or
navigational use and water measuring and control device; or
         D.   Public utility such as an underground culvert or pipe, street or
railroad not requiring fill, and watercourse-crossing bridge or transmission
line above the flood protection elevations.
      (2)   No building, alteration of an existing building, structure or other
encroachment, whether public or private, shall be permitted in the floodway
which acting alone or in combination with existing or reasonably anticipated
uses would impair the designated floodway's ability to carry and discharge the
water resulting from the base flood.
      (3)   No structure associated with use listed in Subsection
1111.08(e)(1) hereof, including the supporting members of bridges and other
public facilities crossing a watercourse, shall be permitted unless an
engineering analysis by a registered engineer demonstrates that encroachment
will not result in any increase in the water surface elevation during the base
flood.
      (4)   Any building expansion or structure in addition to being
floodproofed in accordance with Section
1111.08(k) shall meet the following requirements:
         A.   Have a low flood damage potential;
         B.   Be located on the site outside the floodway whenever possible;
         C.   Be aligned so as to minimize its potential as an obstruction to
the flow of water;
         D.   Minimize the barrier effect of appurtenant works such as fences
and landscaping walls; and
         E.   Maintain the terrain.
   (f)   Prohibited Uses in the Floodway.
      (1)   Within the floodway no building, structure, or premises shall be
used, and no building or structure shall be erected which is designed to be
used for overnight accommodations by human habitants.
      (2)   Any alteration of the floodway terrain through the shifting,
addition or removal of material acting alone or in combination with other
reasonably anticipated alterations would impair the designated floodway's
ability to carry and discharge the waters resulting from the base flood is
prohibited. The applicant shall provide an engineering analysis performed in
accordance with standard engineering practices for any proposed alteration of
the floodway terrain.
   (g)   Permitted Uses in the Floodway Fringe.
      (1)   Any use expressly permitted by the underlying zoning district is
also permitted in the floodway fringe.
      (2)   Any building, structure, or premises located on any portion of any
parcel that is within, or partially within, the floodway fringe shall be
erected, arranged or designed to be used as specified by the underlying zoning
district and in accordance with the following specifications.
          A.   Residential.
            i.   Each residential building or alteration of an existing
residential building shall be elevated such that the lowest floor, including
the basement, cellar, or crawl space, is equal to or above the flood protection
elevation for the site.
            ii.   A residential building shall have a means of ingress and
egress to land outside the floodplain that is above the flood protection
elevation and substantial enough for both pedestrian and vehicular access
during a base flood.
         B.   Commercial, Manufacturing, and Other Nonresidential Uses.
            i.   New construction of, or substantial improvement to, any
building, structure or appurtenant work shall be elevated as provided for in
Subsection
1111.08(g)(2)A hereof, or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall be floodproofed as provided in Section
1111.08(k) to a point at or above the flood protection elevation.
            ii.   Accessory land uses such as yards, railroad tracks and
parking lots may be at lower elevations.
         C.   Public Streets. Public streets shall be at a point equal to or
above the flood protection elevation, or in developed areas shall meet the
maximum elevation already established.
         D.   Railroads, Transmission Lines, Pipes, Well Fields and Related
Facilities Protection to a point equal to or above the flood protection
elevation shall be provided where failure or interruption of these public
facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety or where such
facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area.
         E.   Storage Of Material. Material that, in time of flooding, is
buoyant, flammable, explosive or could be injurious to human, animal or plant
life shall be stored at or above the flood protection elevation, floodproofed
or protected by structural measures consistent with the standards set forth in
Section
1111.08(k).
         F.   Utilities.
            i.   Any new or replacement water supply system or sanitary sewage
system shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters
into the system.
            ii.   Any new or replacement sanitary sewage system shall also be
designed to minimize discharge from the system into flood waters.
            iii.   An on-site waste disposal system shall be located so as to
avoid impairment or contamination during flooding.
   (h)   Prohibited Uses in the Floodway Fringe.
      (1)   Within the floodway fringe area, no building, structure, or
premises shall be used and no building or structure shall be erected in such a
manner as to result in an encroachment into the floodway.
      (2)   Landfill is prohibited in the floodway fringe unless associated
with a specific site development the extent of which shall be fully detailed on
the zoning certificate application and the certificate issued therefor.
   (i)   Zoning Certificate Required for Development in the Floodplain. Within
the floodplain, no building or structure shall be erected, constructed,
altered, or enlarged and no development or use shall occur except upon the
issuance of a zoning certificate.
       (1)   Application for a zoning certificate shall be made to the Zoning
Administrator in accordance with Section
1103.13: Zoning Certificate.
      (2)   Decision on the Zoning Certificate.
         A.   The Zoning Administrator shall not issue a zoning certificate
until:
            i.   It has been determined that sites affected by the floodplain
as designated by the Flood Insurance Study meet all the provision of this
section; or
            ii.   In unnumbered A zones where FEMA has not provided data, the
Village Administrator has determined based on data supplied by the applicant's
engineer or architect that the proposed development will not adversely affect
the flood-carrying capacity of the area of special flood hazard. "Adversely
affect" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one-half foot at any
point. The Village Administrator may require additional engineering data as
part of the application in order to make such a determination.
         B.   Review all applications to assure that all necessary permits have
been received from those federal, state and local governmental agencies from
which prior approval is required. The applicant shall be responsible for
obtaining any additional permit that are necessary from other federal, state,
or local agencies.
         C.   The Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to make
interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of
special flood hazards when there appears to be a conflict between a mapped
boundary and actual field conditions. Where a map boundary and elevation
disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood elevation profile shall
prevail. The applicant may appeal the interpretation in accordance with Section
1103.14: Appeals to the Planning Commission.
   (j)   Variances.
      (1)   Applications for variances from the development standards of this
section shall be filed for determination by the Planning Commission pursuant to
Section
1103.12.
      (2)   No variance shall be granted unless the Planning Commission
determines the application complies with Section
1103.12(c), and below.
      (3)   No variance shall be granted from the provisions of this section by
the Planning Commission until it has considered all the following:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other land to the
injury of others;
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed development to flood damage
and the effect of such damage on the owner;
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
development to the Village;
         E.   The necessity to the development of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         F.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to adopted plans and
floodplain management program for that area;
         I.   The safety of access for vehicles to the property in times of
flood;
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site;
          K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges; and
         L.   Whether the land proposed to be developed consists of less than
one-half acre and is contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level. The granting of variances is
more appropriate for such small tracts than for larger tracts.
      (4)   No variance shall be granted by the Planning Commission where the
variance will result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, extraordinary public expense or nuisances.
      (5)   The Planning Commission shall grant the minimum variance from
development standards of the section necessary to grant relief to the applicant
consistent with the flood hazard to the area.
      (6)   No variance shall be granted by the Planning Commission for land
located within any designated floodway where the variance will result in any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge.
      (7)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (k)   Development Standards for Flood Hazard Reduction. The following
development standards apply to all areas within the floodway fringe.
      (1)    Anchoring.
         A.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
         B.   All manufactured homes not otherwise regulated by the ORC
pertaining to manufactured home parks shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Methods of anchoring may
include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground
anchors.

         B.   Any enclosure which meets these criteria shall be considered as
having met the requirements of Section
1111.08(k)(1).
      (9)   Subdivisions and Large Developments. In all areas of special flood
hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided in accordance
with Section
1111.08(b) or
1111.08(l)(2), the following standards apply to all subdivision proposals,
including manufactured home subdivisions, and other proposed developments
containing at least fifty lots or five acres (whichever is less):
         A.   The applicant shall provide base flood elevation data performed
in accordance with standard engineering practices;
         B.   If Section
1111.08(k)(9)A is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this
section.
   (l)   General Provisions.
      (1)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man- made or
natural causes. This section does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This section does not create liability on the part
of the Village, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
section or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
      (2)   Use of Other Base Flood Elevation and Floodway Data. Areas of
special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency in accordance with Section
1111.08(b), are designated as Zone A on the community's Flood Insurance Rate
Map. Within these areas, the Zoning Administrator shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal, state or other source, including data obtained under the provisions of
Section
1111.08(l)(2), in order to administer the provisions of this section.
      (3)   Alteration of Watercourses. The Village Administrator shall notify
all adjacent communities and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division
of Water, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, submit
evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of
a watercourse so that its flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
      (4)   Reports of Variances Granted. The Village Administrator shall
report any variances granted from the development standards of this section to
the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon its request.
          (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1111.09 SOURCE WATER PROTECTION STANDARDS.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of the source water protection standards is to
safeguard the public health, safety and welfare of the persons and property in
the Village of Centerburg by protecting the ground water that serves as the
Village's source of drinking water. The source water protection standards are
intended to provide for the protection of the water supply into the future,
maintain the natural aquifer recharging ability, reduce the potential for
contamination of the water supply, and heighten awareness of the need to
protect the Village's water supply. The regulations of this section are for the
purpose of protecting the Village's potable water supply from contamination
from existing and future potential pollution sources through the regulation of
the use of those substances which could pose a threat to the Village's existing
and future wellheads and the surrounding aquifer.
   (b)   Determination of Applicability.
      (1)   This section applies to any use, structure, storage, activity or
operation by a facility within a 300-foot radius of the Village's wells, which
are maintained by the Village as a drinking water source. Any use, change in
use or occupancy, construction, grading, structural relocation, alteration,
addition or demolition shall be in conformance with the provisions of this
code. Property owners, facility operators, and occupants shall comply with all
applicable Federal, state and local regulations in addition to this code. Where
other applicable regulations are in conflict with this section, the more
restrictive provision shall apply.
      (2)   It shall be the responsibility of any person owning real property
or owning or operating a business within the Village of Centerburg to make a
determination of the applicability of this section as it pertains to the
property or business or operation, and failure to do so shall not excuse any
violations of this section.
   (c)   Basis for Establishing the Source Water Protection Standards. The
basis for establishing the source water protection standards was the guidance
received from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, including but not
limited to the February 2003 Drinking Water Source Assessment for the Village
of Centerburg on file at the Village office with the Village Clerk.
   (d)   Applicability Across Lot Lines. Where the applicability of the source
water protection standards bisects a parcel of land, only the portion of the
parcel within the 300-foot radius from the well shall be considered as being
subject to these standards unless the Zoning Administrator or Planning
Commission makes the determination that the property needs to be monitored for
potential adverse impacts on the source waters that this chapter is intended to
protect. Factors that shall be taken into consideration when such
determinations are made include, but are not limited to, the amount of area
within and outside of the radius, the size and shape of the parcel, access to
the parcel, the degree to which the parcel may be subdivided, environmental
features of the parcel, the proposed use of the parcel, and the ability to
develop the parcel using that portion outside of the radius.
   (e)   Allowed Uses. Except as otherwise prohibited by this section,
permitted uses and conditional uses shall be those of the applicable zoning
district. The development standards of the applicable zoning district shall
apply to sites within the 300-foot radius. Where a conflict exists between the
standards of the applicable zoning district and this section, the standards of
this section shall apply.
 
   (f)   Special Uses, Prohibited Uses, and Nonconforming Uses. The special
uses within the 300-foot radius shall be those of the applicable zoning
districts subject to any more restrictive regulations of this section.
      (1)   Sanitary landfills, drywells and the filling in of land with
demolition debris or other non-approved matter, and junkyards, are prohibited.
      (2)   Commercial or other facilities for the washing of vehicles or
equipment shall be permitted only if the wastewater from such facilities is
entirely channeled into the sanitary sewer system.
      (3)   Wastewater treatment plant discharges are permitted when subject to
discharge limitations prescribed by the appropriate state and national
regulatory agencies.
      (4)   If a nonconforming use of any land, building or structure is
discontinued for six (6) months or more, any further use shall be in conformity
with the 300-foot radius.
   (g)   Groundwater Protection Standards.
      (1)   Use, storage, handling and/or production of regulated or hazardous
substances in conjunction with permitted and conditional uses in this district
shall be limited as to each use, to:
         A.   The aggregate of regulated or hazardous substances in use,
storage, handling and/or production may not exceed twenty (20) gallons or 160
pounds at any time.
         B.   The total use, storage, handling and/or production of regulated
or hazardous substances may not exceed fifty (50) gallons or 400 pounds in any
twelve (12)-month period.
      (2)   Storage of fuel and lubricants is prohibited except for regulated
substances that are an integral component of and stored on individual vehicles
or equipment that are used specifically and solely for the operation of the
equipment in which the substances are contained.
      (3)   No substitutions of a non-conforming use shall be permitted which
results in an increase of the Hazardous Potential Ranking System on a parcel
within this district. If the Hazardous Potential Ranking decreases for a non-
conforming use for a period of twelve months or more, the non-conforming right
to the higher Hazardous Potential Ranking shall be deemed to have been lost
through non-use for that period of time.
      (4)   Heating fuels for residential use in tanks having a capacity of 500
gallons or less are exempt from this code.
   (h)   Hazard Potential Ranking System For Nonconforming Uses.
      (1)   Any existing uses legally storing, handling using and/or producing
regulated or hazardous substances in amounts equal to or less than the
requirements under Section
1111.09(g) are considered conforming uses and this section does not apply. Any
new use or change of uses shall maintain the conforming status of the property.
      (2)   Existing nonconforming uses shall be permitted to maintain the
reported maximum quantity for each reportable regulated or hazardous substance,
as determined by peak business cycle. Existing uses and maximum quantities, in
combination with a hazard potential rating shall run with the land and be
administered in conformance with all other applicable nonconforming provisions
of this code.
      (3)   In order to assess the risk for potential groundwater
contamination, a hazard ranking has been developed for various activities
categorized by their Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code. This
ranking is based on the kind of materials commonly associated with each use
looking only at the most critical hydrologic factors. This ranking, published
and updated regularly by the USEPA, is hereby incorporated by reference.
 
   (i)   Regulated Materials Activity Inventory.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section
1111.09(g)(2) through
1111.09(g)(4), any owner or occupant of any land in the 300-foot radius
established in this section at the effective date of the section, shall file a
Regulated Substance Activity Inventory Report with the Zoning Administrator.
Said report shall be filed within 180 days of the effective date of this
section and at twelve (12)-month intervals thereafter.
      (2)   Except as provided in Section
1111.09(f)(2) through
1111.09(f)(4), any new owner or occupant of any land in the 300-foot radius
established in this section shall file a Regulated Substance Activity Report
prior to receipt of a certificate of occupancy and at twelve (12)-month
intervals following the date of occupancy. For purposes of this section, new
shall be defined as subsequent to the effective date of this section.
      (3)   Where a person owns, operates or occupies more than one location,
Regulated Substances Activity Reports shall be made for each location.
      (4)   Agricultural uses shall file a Regulated Substance Activity Report
within 180 days after the effective date of this section and at twelve (12)-
month intervals thereafter. Regulated Substance Activity Reports for
agricultural uses shall include total annual on-site application of regulated
substances for the reporting property.
   (j)   Regulated or Hazardous Materials. The materials, chemicals or
substances regulated by this chapter, and particularly restricted by Section
1111.09(g), are listed and published under the authority of the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), Title
III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), and the
Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act of 1986, which list as are
currently in effect and may be revised, are hereby adopted by reference. Said
regulated or hazardous materials, include but are not limited to:
      (1)   Petroleum or petroleum-based liquid products;
      (2)   Antifreeze, transmission fluids, brake fluids and coolants;
      (3)   Solvents (raw or spent), alcohols, hydrocarbons, and ketones;

      (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1113.02 APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   Single-family and two-family dwellings shall be exempt from the
requirements of this chapter with the exception of Section
1113.04 and Section
1113.05.
   (b)   The requirements of this chapter shall apply to all other new
development or expansions to other principal buildings.
   (c)   If a vehicular use area is expanded an area less than twenty-five
percent (25%) of the vehicular use area that existed on the effective date of
this code, where there is no construction or alteration of a building on the
same site, the landscaping requirements of Section
1113.08 shall apply to the expanded vehicular use area.
   (d)   If a vehicular use area is expanded more than the twenty-five percent
(25%) allowed above, without construction or alteration of the building or if a
vehicular use area is demolished and replaced or redesigned, the landscaping
requirements of Section
1113.08 shall apply to the entire vehicular use area.
   (e)   Landscaping requirements shall be reviewed as part of an application
for a site plan, development plan for planned developments, subdivision plat,
variance, conditional use, or zoning certificate, whichever is occurs first.
Landscaping review may be continued and/or completed under a later part of the
approval process upon request of the Zoning Administrator and agreement of the
applicant.
   (f)   No variance, zoning certificate, development plan approval, site plan
approval, or conditional use permit shall be granted or issued until final
approval of the landscaping plan.
(Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1113.03 INSTALLATION TIMING.
   (a)   No occupancy permit shall be issued until the installation of the
landscaping as shown on the approved plan is complete and accepted by the
Zoning Administrator unless a performance bond, cash bond or irrevocable letter
of credit is posted at the time the zoning certificate is issued.
 
   (b)   Posting of Bond or Letter of Credit.
       (1)   The bond or letter of credit shall be in an amount equal to one
hundred percent (100%) of the estimated cost of landscaping and installation as
specified in the approved landscape plan and in a form acceptable to the
Village. The property owner shall provide a landscape quote or estimate for
completion of the approved plan for the landscaping, upon which the required
amount of bond or letter of credit shall be based. The Zoning Administrator
shall have the authority to demand a bond for more than the quote or estimate
if, in the Zoning Administrator's opinion, the quote or estimate could be
insufficient to complete the work at a later date.
      (2)   The bond or letter of credit shall remain in effect until such time
as the installation of the landscaping is completed and has been determined by
the Village to be in accordance with the final approved landscaping plan.
      (3)   Forfeiture proceedings shall be brought against the bond or letter
of credit if the required landscaping has not been installed within six months
of the approval of the zoning certificate.
      (4)   In the event of failure to install the required landscaping,
written notice shall be served upon the holder of the performance guarantee.
Such notice shall state that the failure to install the landscaping as required
shall result in the forfeiture of the performance guarantee and that such
failure shall be deemed an implied consent for the Village to cause said
landscape to be installed at the cost of the forfeiture of the performance
bond. Additional costs to complete installation shall become a lien on the
property in accordance with state law.
         (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1113.04 MINIMUM MATERIALS AND STANDARDS.
   The following identifies the minimum landscape and screening standard

from use as part of any landscaping requirement where the tree or its canopy
will hang over a vehicular use areas, sidewalks, or other paved areas.
         D.   Invasive species identified in OAC 901:5-30-01 shall be
prohibited.
         E.   To curtail the spread of disease or insect infestation in a plant
species if a new development contains over five (5) trees, the application
should include at least two (2) different species of trees.
      (6)   Existing live and healthy vegetation that meets the standards of
this section may be used to meet the standards of this chapter.
      (7)   Any trees, shrubs, or landscaping materials used to meet the
standards of this chapter shall be required to meet the height and size
standards of this section. Any trees, shrubs, or landscaping materials
incorporated onto a site that exceeds the amount required by this chapter may
be of any size.
   (b)   Accessways. Necessary accessways shall be permitted to traverse
required landscaping and screening areas. The width of such accessways shall
not be subtracted from the linear dimensions used to determine the minimum
number of trees and shrubs required in this chapter.
   (c)   Fencing and Landscaping Walls.
      (1)   All fencing or landscaping walls used for screening purposes shall
comply with Section
1111.03 and shall be seventy-five percent (75%) in opacity.
      (2)   The bottom of all fences used to meet the landscaping requirements
of this chapter shall be a minimum of two inches above the ground grade.
      (3)   Materials and colors used for fences and landscaping walls shall be
similar or complementary to the principal building on the lot.
   (d)   Mounds and Berms.
      (1)   Earthen mounds and berms shall have a maximum slope of 3:1 (three
(3) feet of horizontal space is required for each one-foot vertical change in
elevation).
      (2)   The crest or top of the mound shall be rounded with elevation
changes maintained one foot off of the centerline of the mound.
      (3)   Earthen mounds or berms shall be designed and constructed with
variations in physical alignment throughout the length of the mound or berm.
   (e)   Location.
      (1)   No trees shall be planted over any storm or sanitary sewers, or in
a manner where the root structure is reasonably expected to interfere with such
underground facilities.
      (2)   All required landscaping and screening materials shall be installed
on the subject property requiring the landscaping and screening.
      (3)   Perimeter landscaping and/or landscaped areas used for screening
shall have a minimum width of five (5) feet.
         (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1113.05 GENERAL LANDSCAPING FOR LOTS AND FOUNDATIONS.
   (a)   To visually soften the building mass or help define exterior spaces,
the following landscaping shall be required for all lots in addition to the
landscaping required by the remainder of this chapter.
   (b)   All required planting shall be located in areas which do not include
any required bufferyard, right- of-way, or easements for utilities or access.
   (c)   Any trees or plants required by this section shall not count toward
any other landscaping requirement of this chapter.
   (d)   If the lot consists primarily of impervious surface, such trees may be
placed close to the building or may be used to add to required parking area
landscaping.
   (e)   Lot Landscaping. Deciduous trees shall be required to be planted on
the same lot as any new nonresidential building. The number of trees shall
equal three (3) trees for each 100 linear feet of building perimeter of the
principal building.
   (f)   Building Foundation Plantings.
      (1)   Foundation plants are required for all uses except single-family
and two-family dwellings.
      (2)   Foundation plantings are intended to soften building edges and
screen foundations, and shall be placed within five (5) feet of the building
perimeter, if feasible. If the Zoning Administrator determines that, because of
site design considerations such as the location of sidewalks, plazas or service
areas, this is not feasible, such plant materials may be located in planter
boxes or in other areas of the site in a manner that enhances the overall
landscape plan for the development.
      (3)   Five shrubs shall be required per dwelling unit for any residential
use along the foundation.
      (4)   Foundation shrubbery for nonresidential uses shall be used to
enhance and highlight building architecture. The use of foundation plantings is
particularly important on blank facade walls (i.e., to window or door
openings). As such, one shrub shall be required for every ten (10) linear feet
of building perimeter for nonresidential buildings.
         (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1113.06 REQUIRED BUFFERYARD BETWEEN LAND USES.
   The bufferyard is a designated open area, together with any plant materials,
barriers, or fences required thereon. Both the amount of land and the type and
amount of landscaping specified are designated to lessen impacts between
adjoining land uses. By using both distance and landscaping, the impact of such
items as noise, glare, activity, dirt, and unsightly parking areas will be
minimized. It is a further intent of the following provisions to provide
flexibility to the property owner through the adjustment of four basic
elements: distance, plant material type, plant material density, and structural
or land forms.
   (a)   Bufferyards shall be located on the side and rear lot lines of a
parcel extending to the lot or parcel boundary line. Bufferyards shall not
extend into or be located within any portion of an existing street right-of-
way.
   (b)   To determine the type of bufferyard required between two (2) adjacent
parcels, the following procedure shall be followed:
      (1)   Identify the land use class of the proposed use by referring to
Table 1113-1.
      (2)   Identify the land use class of each adjoining use by referring to
Table 1113-2.
      (3)   Determine the bufferyard requirements for those side and rear lot
lines or portion thereof on the subject parcel by referring to Table 1113-2.
The bufferyards specified are to be provided on each lot or parcel independent
of adjoining uses or adjoining bufferyards.
      (4)   Should a developed use increase in intensity from a given land use
class to a higher one (e.g., Class 3 to Class 4), the Planning Commission
shall, during the site plan or development plan review process, determine if
additional bufferyard is needed and, if so, to what extent and type.
      (5)   Bufferyard requirements are stated in terms of the width of the
bufferyard and the number of plant units required per 100 linear feet of
bufferyard. The requirements may be satisfied by any of the options indicated
in Table 1113-3.
   (c)   Bufferyard Requirements for Nonconforming Structures or Sites. If a
nonconforming site is unable to comply with the minimum bufferyard requirements
of this chapter, the applicant shall not be entitled to the permit for which
application has been made unless a variance is granted. Existing paved areas
beyond the minimum code requirements for number of spaces, maneuvering/access
aisles or loading areas, shall be removed if necessary to provide the required
buffer.

the entire length of the bufferyard.
[3]   The fence shall be a opaque fence with a height of four (4) to six
(6) feet along the entire length of the bufferyard.
(Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1113.07 REQUIRED SCREENING OF SERVICE AREAS.
   (a)   In addition to the other forms of required landscaping, screening
shall be required to conceal specific areas of high visual or auditory impact
or hazardous areas from adjacent, less intensive uses and from views from
public rights-of-way. Such areas shall be screened at all times, unless
otherwise specified, regardless of adjacent uses, districts, or other proximate
landscaping material.
   (b)   The following areas shall be screened in accordance with this section:
      (1)   Large waste receptacles (e.g., dumpsters and cardboard recycling
containers) and refuse collection areas;
      (2)   Accessory outdoor storage and bulk sales;
      (3)   Pipes, conduit, and cables associated with the building or use;
      (4)   Outdoor service areas that are necessary to support common business
operations (e.g., outdoor air-conditioner, freezer or refrigeration units,
storage units, etc.);
      (5)   Ground-level or facade-mounted mechanical equipment; and
      (6)   Roof top equipment that is not otherwise hidden by the roofline,
parapet wall, or other similar feature.
   (c)   Screening shall not be required if any of the above items are not
visible from adjacent rights-of- way or from adjacent lots in residential
zoning districts.
   (d)   All sides of the item shall be screened with the exception that one
side of the item may be screened with a gate or other similar feature to allow
access.
   (e)   Screening Methods.
      (1)   The following items are permitted for use as screening materials,
and more than one method may be used on a lot or site.
         A.   Vegetative materials that provide an opaque screen of at least
seventy-five percent (75%), year- round, to the minimum height necessary to
fully screen the facility from off-site views (See Figure 1113-A.) but in no
case shall that screen be less than six (6)-feet tall or exceed eight (8) feet
in height; or
         B.   An opaque fence or landscaping wall, with a height of six (6)
feet, consistent with the standards of Section
1111.03; or

equipment and a dumpster.
       (2)   The required screening shall have a height sufficient enough to
screen the applicable item(s) provided it is in accordance with any other
applicable sections of this code.
      (3)   To the maximum extent feasible, pipes, conduit, and cables should
be located along the rear facade of buildings if conditions do not allow for
them to be enclosed within the building itself. Pipes, conduit, and cables
shall be located as far away from public view as practical and shall be painted
a similar color as the building facade to further reduce visibility.
      (4)   In all cases, fences and landscaping walls are limited to the
heights allowed by Section
1111.03 unless the landscaping wall used for screening is an extension of the
principal building, in which case, the landscaping wall may be the same height
as the principal building wall that from which it is extended. See Figure 1113-

1113.08 REQUIRED SCREENING OF VEHICULAR USE AREAS.
   (a)   This section establishes the minimum standards by which parking areas
will be screened from adjacent public streets or from adjacent properties. In
addition, this section delineates standards for landscaping within the interior
of vehicular use areas and along the perimeter.
   (b)   Whenever required screening is adjacent to parking areas or driveways,
such screening shall be protected by bollards, wheel blocks, or curbing to
avoid damage by vehicles.
   
   (c)   Perimeter Landscaping Required.
      (1)   The perimeter landscaping requirements of this section shall apply
to all off-street vehicular use areas adjacent to a public street or to a lot
line where the parking area contains five or more parking spaces.
      (2)   Vehicular use areas adjacent to public streets shall be separated
from the edge of the right- of-way by a perimeter landscape strip no less than
two and one-half feet in width in the VC District and five (5) feet in width in
all other districts. This width shall not include the sidewalk or any other
paved area.
      (3)   The screening shall consist of fences, landscaping walls, or live
vegetation with a minimum height of two feet and a maximum height of six (6)
feet.
      (4)   The screening shall have a minimum opaqueness of seventy-five
percent (75), year-round. Areas of the landscaped area not covered by trees or
shrubs shall be covered with grass or other approved ground cover.
      (5)   Perimeter landscape strips shall be continuous and unbroken except
for driveways or sidewalks required to access the parking area.

Figure 1113-C: The above image illustrates an example of a perimeter
landscaping screening of a vehicular use area.
   (d)   Interior Vehicular Use Area Landscaping Required.
      (1)   The interior vehicular area landscaping requirements of this
section shall apply to all off- street parking areas where the parking area
contains 6,000 square feet of paved surface or fifteen (15) parking spaces,
whichever is less.
      (2)   Such landscaping shall be in addition to landscaping adjacent to
public streets and screening requirements as specified in this chapter.
      (3)   A minimum of ten percent (10%) of the vehicular use area shall be
landscaped. Whenever possible, large parking areas shall be designed so as to
break up their visual expanse and create the appearance of smaller parking
lots. This distinction or separation can be achieved by interspersing yard
space and buildings in strategic areas and by taking advantage of natural
features such as slope, existing woodland or vegetation, drainage courses and
retention areas.
      (4)   The interior landscaping shall be located within landscaped islands
that are separated from the perimeter landscaping required in Section
1111.03 and shall be scattered throughout the parking area to break up large
areas of pavement. Landscaped islands that are designed as extensions from the
perimeter landscaping areas shall also be considered as interior parking area
landscaping but shall not count as the perimeter landscaping area. See Figure
1113-D.

within a minimum dimension of ten (10) feet in any direction to provide a
suitable living environment for the landscaping.
      (6)   There shall be a minimum of two feet between all tree trunks and
shrub bases and the edge of pavement.
      (7)   There shall be at least one tree (deciduous or evergreen) and two
shrubs for every ten (10) parks spaces. Such vegetation shall be planted in the
required landscape islands.
      (8)   Where site distance or maneuvering conflicts exist, trees shall
have a clear trunk of at least six (6) feet above the ground, and the remaining
required landscape areas shall be planted with shrubs or groundcover not to
exceed two (2) feet in height.
      (9)   The Planning Commission may consider a variance to the minimum and
maximum size of parking islands and peninsulas if situations including, but not
limited to, the following:
         A.   The need to concentrate landscape areas for the purpose of
stormwater detention; or
         B.   The need to relocate required landscaping on the perimeter of a
parking area in the case of a small or unusually shaped lot or where additional
screening is desired.
            (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1113.09 MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   The owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping in
good condition so as to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance. This
should be accomplished by the following standards:
   (a)   All plant growth in landscaped areas shall be controlled by pruning,
trimming or other suitable methods so that plant materials do not interfere
with public utilities, restrict pedestrian or vehicular access, or otherwise
constitute a traffic hazard.
   (b)   All planted areas shall be maintained in a relatively weed-free
condition, clear of undergrowth and free from refuse and debris.
    (c)   All landscaping materials contained on an approved landscape plan
must be properly maintained. All plant materials shall be replaced if they die
or become unhealthy because of accidents, drainage problems, disease or other
causes. Replacement plants shall conform to the size standards that govern
original installation. Deciduous trees must be replaced with deciduous trees,
evergreen trees must be placed with evergreen trees, and shrubbery must be
replaced with shrubbery. Plants intended for screening must maintain the

1113: Landscaping and Screening.
   (i)   Bicycle Parking.
      (1)   Purpose. The requirements for bicycle parking are established for
the purpose of ensuring adequate and safe facilities to accommodate bicycle
parking and to encourage use of bicycles for travel as an alternative to use of
motorized vehicles.
       (2)   Applicability.
         A.   Any new construction in the CC, VC, and P-I Districts after the
effective date of this code is required to provide bicycle spaces or other
bicycle parking (and locking) accommodations for all development, in accordance
with this subsection.
         B.   All short-term rental uses shall be required to provide spaces in
accordance with this section.
         C.   All public or institutional uses, in any district, are also
required to provide similar facilities in accordance with this subsection.
      (3)   Standards.
         A.   The use of bicycle racks to comply with the bicycle space
requirement shall be free of charge to any bicyclist. Fees may be charged for
the use of bike lockers or other more permanent bicycle parking or storage
facilities.
         B.   Any bicycle space shall be located in an area adjacent to the
building and separate from vehicular traffic circulation so as to prevent
traffic conflicts and safety hazards between vehicles and bicyclists. Such
separation shall be created through the use of physical barriers such as curbs,
wheel stops, bollards, or other similar features.
         C.   The applicant may provide a single bicycle rack or multiple
bicycle racks to accommodate the required number of spaces.
         D.   A minimum of one (1) bicycle parking space shall be provided for
each short-term rental use and a minimum of one (1) bicycle parking space for

         (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1115.04 OFF-STREET PARKING STANDARDS.
   (a)   Number of Parking Spaces Required. The number of off-street parking
spaces required shall be based on the requirements of Section
1115.04(a)(2) below, or an alternative parking space plan may be provided in
accordance with Section
1115.04(a)(3).
      (1)   Computation. In computing the number of parking spaces required by
this code, the following shall apply:
         A.   Where floor area is designated as the standard for determining
parking space requirements, floor area shall be as defined by this code but is
not intended to mean gross floor area.
          B.   Where seating capacity is designated as the standard for
determining parking space requirements, the capacity shall mean the number of
seating units installed, and where individual seats are not provided (bench,
pew, etc.), one seat shall be for each twenty-four (24) lineal inches of
seating facilities.
         C.   Fractional numbers shall be increased to the next highest whole
number.
         D.   Parking spaces shall be provided according to the schedule of
uses in this subsection. In residential use areas, garages or carports may be
counted as a part of the required parking.
         E.   Multiple Uses. In the case of multiple uses in one building or on
one property, the total requirements for off-street parking may be reduced. The
reduction shall be based on the sum of the minimum parking spaces required in
the table in this subsection, computed separately, and reduced by not more than
twenty-five percent (25%). Any reduction in spaces shall be reviewed and
approved by the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)   Minimum Parking Spaces Table.
         A.   Table 1115-1 establishes the minimum number of parking spaces
required for individual uses. For uses that are not specifically stated, the
Zoning Administrator may identify a parking requirement that most closely
reflects the land use and intensity of the proposed use or may require an
alternative parking space plan as established in Section
1115.04(a)(3).
         B.   In order to prevent excessive lot coverage, the artificial
increase in ambient air temperature, and an unnecessary increase in surface
water run-off, no application shall propose more than one hundred twenty-five
percent (125%) of the spaces required in Table 1115-1 unless good cause can be
shown by the applicant and approved by the Planning Commission through the
variance process. Single-family dwellings and two-family dwellings shall be
exempt from this provision.
         C.   An alternative parking space plan is not permitted for uses
marked with an asterisk (*) in Table 1115-1. An alternative parking space plan
shall only be permitted when the applicant wants to propose less than the
number required by Table 1115-1.
         D.   There shall be no minimum off-street parking requirements for
uses in the VC District.

(ITE), or similar resources in making its determination. If the Planning
Commission denies the alternative parking space plan, the applicant shall be
required to meet the minimum number of spaces required by Table 1115-1 above or
seek approval of a variance.
   (b)   Dimensional Requirements for Parking Spaces and Drive Aisles.
      (1)   Areas for off-street parking facilities shall be designed in
accordance with the minimum dimensional requirements established in Table 1115-

chapter.
   (e)   Alternative Parking Solutions.
      (1)   Shared or Off-Site Parking. A variance to parking standards on a
lot may be granted for a portion of the required parking spaces to be located
on an adjacent or nearby property if the parking area complies with the
following standards.
         A.   Shared parking is encouraged and permitted if the multiple uses
that the shared parking will benefit can cooperatively establish and operate
the facilities.
         B.   Off-site parking shall not be used to satisfy the off-street
parking standards for residential uses.
         C.   Required parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities

         E.   Shared or off-site parking areas shall adhere to the regulations
of the same or a more intensive zoning classification than that required for
the use served.
         F.   In the event that a shared or off-site parking area is located on
multiple parcels, a written parking agreement shall be required and must be
approved by the Zoning Administrator and then recorded with the Knox County
Recorder for all lots subject to the agreement.
         G.   No shared or off-site parking space shall be located more than
500 feet from the primary entrance of the use served, measured along the
shortest legal, practical walking route. This route may include crossing a
right-of-way provided it uses a legal crosswalk.
         H.   The applicant shall have the burden of proof for reduction of the
total number of parking spaces and shall document and submit information
substantiating their request. Shared or off-site parking may be approved if it
complies with the following standards:
            i.   A sufficient number of spaces shall be provided to meet the
highest demand of the participating uses.
            ii.   Evidence shall be submitted by the parties operating the
shared parking area, to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator ,

fifty percent (50%) of the required parking spaces as established in Section
1115.04(a).
            iv.   Any change in use of the activities served by a shared or
off-site parking area will be deemed an amendment to the shared or off-site
parking area plan and will require review and approval by the Zoning
Administrator.
            v.   All shared or off-site parking plans and agreements shall be
provided to the Zoning Administrator prior to any certificate of zoning
approval being issued. Such plans and agreements continue to apply to the land,
regardless of future ownership.
      (2)   Land Banked Parking. Up to fifty percent (50%) of the required
parking spaces may remain landscaped and unpaved, or paved with pervious
pavement, provided that the parking and unpaved areas comply with the following
standards and are authorized in accordance with this section. See Figure 1115-
C, below.

Figure 1115-C: The parking lot shown on the left is a traditional parking lot
with interior parking islands while the parking lot on the right illustrates
where an area is unimproved but is designated for future parking spaces if the
demand arises.
         A.   The parking plan submitted with the site plan application shall
denote the location and layout of that portion of the parking area that
currently is deemed not required. The plan shall indicate that the "land
banked" parking spaces will be constructed according to these regulations if
the Planning Commission determines at any time that all or any portion of this
parking is necessary. Such determination shall be held after the Zoning
Administrator determines the need for construction of the land banked parking
and forward the determination on to the Planning Commission for review as a
public hearing in the same manner as the variance procedure. See Section
1103.12.
         B.   The applicant shall be required to design the site for full
compliance with the applicable stormwater regulations, lighting regulations,
and landscaping regulations even though a portion of the parking area may not
be developed initially.
         C.   Any conditions required by the Village, and the design for the
site as established above, shall be illustrated on a final site plan, approved
as part of the certificate of zoning approval application and maintained as
part of the Village's official records.
         D.   At no time shall any portion of the land banked parking area that
is designated for future development be used for the construction of any
structure or paved surface with the exception that pervious pavement may be
used to provide temporary parking, provided that the pavers allow for grass and
other vegetation to grow through the material.
         E.   At no time shall any portion of the land banked parking or
loading area that is so designated for future construction as provided herein
be counted as open space or other non-paved areas required by other provisions
of this code.
         F.   The owner shall initiate construction of the approved land banked
parking area(s), as identified on the approved parking plan, within three
months of the receipt of a certified letter or a letter through normal postal
service (if the certified letter is not accepted) sent to the owner of record
from the Zoning Administrator, identifying that such parking is determined to
be necessary. Such determination may be made when the Zoning Administrator:
            i.   Is reviewing an application related to a change of use or
activity; or
            ii.   Documents that vehicles related to the use are consistently
parked on the grass, landscaping area, or on the street.
            iii.   Off-site or shared parking alternatives shall not be
permitted where land bank parking is utilized.

shall have the authority to require such spaces if there is a demonstrated need
to accommodate this loading or unloading area.
    (b)   Size. Loading spaces shall conform to the following minimum
dimensions. Unless otherwise noted, all dimensions are exclusive of any
driveway, aisle or other circulation area:
      (1)   For loading spaces that will accommodate box trucks or vehicles
smaller than a semi- trailer truck, the space shall have a minimum width of
twelve (12) feet, a minimum length of twenty (20) feet and a minimum clearance
height of fifteen (15) feet.
      (2)   For loading spaces that will semi-trailer trucks, the space shall

      (1)   All loading spaces and maneuvering areas shall be located on the
same lot as the use they are intended to serve.
      (2)   Loading and unloading areas shall be so located and designed that
the vehicles intended to use them can maneuver safely and conveniently to and
from a public right-of-way, and complete the loading and unloading operations
without obstructing or interfering with any public right-of-way or any parking
space or parking lot aisle.
      (3)   No area allocated to loading and unloading facilities may be used
to satisfy the area requirements for off-street parking, nor shall any portion
of any off-street parking area be used to satisfy the area requirements for
loading and unloading facilities.
      (4)   Off-street loading spaces shall be so arranged that they may be
used without blocking, and they shall not obstruct or occupy, any parking
space, circulation or drive aisles, sidewalks, or vehicle stacking spaces for
drive through lanes.
      (5)   A loading space may occupy all or any part of any required side or
rear yard. No loading or unloading shall occur in a front yard, except for
structures less than 15,000 square feet.

servicing motor vehicles, or for storage.
   (d)   Access.
      (1)   All required off-street loading spaces shall have access to a
public street or alley in such a manner that any vehicle entering or exiting
the premises shall be traveling in a forward motion onto such street or alley.
      (2)   Each required off-street loading space shall be designed for direct
vehicular access by means of a driveway, or driveways, to a public street in a
manner which shall least interfere with adjacent traffic movements and interior
circulation. The access drive of an off-street loading facility shall be
located so that the driveway center line shall not be less than fifty (50) feet
from the nearest intersecting street right-of-way line.
   (e)   Improvements. All off-street loading spaces shall be improved as
required for all vehicular use areas as set forth in Section
1115.03.

concrete median, concrete curb, landscaping, or painted striping.
      (3)   The number of stacking spaces required by Table 1115-3 shall be
required for each separate stacking lane. If two or more stacking lanes
converge into one lane (e.g., two (2) separate lanes to order at a restaurant
converge to one lane after the drive-through sign), the stacking spaces shall
be measured in accordance with Table 1115-3 with the spaces located after the
convergence point counting toward both stacking lanes.
      (4)   Vehicles shall not be permitted to wait within the public right-of-
way for service at such drive-in or drive-thru facilities.
 
   (d)   The Planning Commission may reduce the number of required stacking

1117.04 CALCULATION AND MEASUREMENTS.
   (a)   Sign Setback. All required setbacks for signs shall be measured as the
distance in feet from the applicable lot line, or other stated point of
measurement, to the closest point on the sign structure.
   (b)   Sign Height.
      (1)   The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the
base of the sign at the finished grade to the top of the highest attached
component of the sign.
      (2)   The finished grade shall be defined as established in Section
1111.01(d)(1).
      (3)   In cases where the finished grade at the required setback is below
grade at street level, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the
elevation of the finished grade at the base of the sign is equal to the
elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public or private street. See
Figure 1117-A.

Figure 1117-A: Illustration of the measurement of sign height when the grade at
the bottom of the sign is below the grade of the adjacent street.
   (c)   Sign Area. The surface of a sign to be included when computing maximum
allowable square footage of sign area shall be calculated as established in
this section.
      (1)   The calculation of sign area shall not include any supporting
framework, bracing or decorative fence or landscaping wall unless such
structural support is determined to constitute an integral part of the sign
design by means of text or other message, as determined by the Zoning
Administrator. See Figure 1117-B.
      (2)   For sign copy mounted or painted on a background panel, cabinet or
surface that is distinctively painted, textured, lighted or constructed to
serve as the background for the sign copy, the sign area shall be computed by
enclosing such sign area with the smallest, single continuous perimeter around
the background for the sign copy and determining its area. See Figure 1117-
B and Figure 1117-C.

      (3)   For sign copy where individual letters or elements are mounted on a
building facade or window where there is no background panel, cabinet or
surface that is distinctively painted, textured, lighted or constructed to
serve as the background for the sign copy, the sign area shall be computed by
enclosing such sign area with the smallest, single continuous perimeter that
encloses all of the letters or elements associated with the sign. See Figure
1117-D.

individual letters and no definable sign background.
      (4)   In cases where there are multiple elements of sign copy on the same
surface, any areas of sign copy that are within two (2) feet of one another
shall be calculated as a single sign area that shall be computed by means of
the smallest permitted shape that encloses all sign copy within two (2) feet of
one another, otherwise the sign area shall be computed for each separate piece
of sign copy. See Figure 1117-E.

Figure 1117-E: Illustration of sign area calculations for multiple sign areas
on a window sign.
      (5)   When two identically sized, flat sign faces are placed back-to-back
or in a V-angle (less than forty-five (45) degrees between sign faces) and with
no more than twenty-four (24) inches in separation, the sign area shall be
computed by the measurement of one of the sign faces.
      (6)   For three-dimensional signs that have more than two (2) faces or
have two (2) faces that are separated by more than twenty-four (24) inches, the
sign shall be measured as the total sign area of the two (2) largest sign
faces.
      (7)   For structures and uses having no direct frontage on public roads,
or lot widths that are wider than the street frontage (e.g., shopping centers
with outlots), where street frontage is used in a calculation, the frontage
shall be measured along a straight line that runs parallel with the street
frontage at the widest point of the lot. This measurement shall be regardless
of the presence of driveway entrances to the lot or the presence of smaller
outlots in front of the applicable lot. See Figure 1117-F.
      (8)   Where a building is located across multiple lots under the same
ownership, the lot width shall be measured as an aggregate of the lot widths of
all lots and only one freestanding sign shall be permitted on each street
frontage, regardless of the number of lots. See Figure 1117-F.

width when calculating the amount of freestanding sign area permitted on a lot.
 
   (d)   Facade Measurements.
      (1)   When calculating the permitted sign area based on the width of any
facade, such calculation shall be based on viewing the facade from a ninety
(90)-degree angle (i.e., straight on) from the adjacent street, regardless of
facade insets, offsets or angles. See Figure 1117-G.

      (2)   For multi-tenant buildings, the portion of a building that is owned
or leased, and approved by the Central Ohio Joint Fire District for occupancy
by a single occupant or tenant shall be considered a building unit for the
purposes of this chapter. See Figure 1117-H.

a multi-tenant building in between. The multi-tenant building has two building
units as identified as 2 and 3 in the image.
      (3)   The primary facade shall include any facade that has frontage along
a street and any facade that serves as the main access point to a building or
building unit. All other facades shall be considered to be secondary facades
for the purposes of this chapter provided such facades do not face a
residential zoning district. See Figure 1117-I.

miles per hour speed limit zone or greater speed limit.
            ii.   An electronic message center shall only be allowed on
monument signs.
            iii.   The electronic message center portion of the sign shall not
be larger than ninety percent (90%) of the total sign area allowed for the
monument sign on the applicable lot based on the standards of this chapter.
         B.   Copy (Lettering).
            i.   Copy (lettering) shall be limited to red letters on a black
background.
            ii.   Letters shall not be smaller than four (4) inches nor greater
than eight (8) inches in height. Letters shall be of an appropriate width
proportionate to height to be clearly legible.
            iii.   Each electronic message center will not display more than
four (4) rows of text at any time.
         C.   Brightness.
            i.   The maximum luminance shall not exceed 5,000 nits between
sunrise and sunset.

1117.05(j)(6)C.iii, the electronic message center shall automatically adjust
luminance to a maximum of 250 nits from sunset to sunrise.
            iii.   Where a residential dwelling is located within thirty (30)
meters (98.42 feet) of the electronic message center face, and for all
electronic message centers on lots zoned P-I, the electronic message center
must be turned off between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 5:30 a.m. Where a
business located on the lot is open to the public past 10:00 p.m., the
electronic message center may remain functional until the close of business
hours. An application should provide evidence to demonstrate no conflict will
occur with any adjacent residential development.
         D.   Message Timing.
            i.   Each message shall appear static for a minimum of ten (10)
seconds ("dwell time").
            ii.   Transition Time
               a)   If a fade or dissolve effect is used, the effect will take
no more than three seconds to complete transition.
               b)   If a fade or dissolve effect is not used, the electronic
message center will not display a blank screen between messages for more than
one second before the next message appears.
         E.   Permitted Effects. The electronic message center may use the
following effects:
            i.   Dissolve: an effect accomplished by varying the light
intensity and pattern an effect in which one message gradually appears to
dissipate and lose the legibility with the gradual appearance and legibility of
the second message.
            ii.   Fade: an effect accomplished by varying the light intensity,
where a message is gradually reduced in intensity to the point of not being
legible followed by a subsequent message which gradually increases intensity to
the point of legibility.
         F.   Prohibited Effects. The electronic message center shall not use
the following effects:
            i.   Flashing: exhibiting changing light or color effect by any
means to provide intermittent illumination that changes light intensity in
sudden transitory bursts and creates the illusion of intermittent flashing
light by streaming, graphic bursts showing movement, or any mode of lighting
which resembles zooming, twinkling or sparkling (except dissolve or fade).
            ii.   Spinning or rotating;
            iii.   Interactive display;
            iv.   Sequencing: An effect where a message is not completed in one
display, and is continued on a subsequent display.

center until it is repaired and fully functioning.
            ii.   The owner of the electronic message center shall use
reasonable means to control and secure access to the electronic message center
programming and message capabilities to ensure that those messages approved to
appropriate owner personnel are displayed.
            iii.   At no time will the owner of the electronic message center
permit the electronic message center to constitute a nuisance which would
include but not be limited to being inoperable, malfunctioning, abandoned,
etc., to neighboring property owners or the community, or to be a hazard to
traffic safety. While operating the electronic message center outside these
guidelines will be a nuisance and/or hazard, it is not yet known whether a
nuisance or hazard may result from the operation within these guidelines. Once
the electronic message center is operational, if the Village determines that
their operation constitutes a nuisance or hazard, the owner will coordinate
with the Village to mitigate and resolve the nuisance or hazard.
            iv.   In the case of malfunction, the electronic message center
shall contain a default design to freeze the sign message in one position.

1117.09 TEMPORARY SIGNS.
   The following are the types of temporary signs allowed in the Village of
Centerburg, including any applicable regulations for each type of sign.
   (a)   Standards Applicable to All Temporary Signs.
      (1)   Temporary signs shall not be mounted, attached, affixed, installed
or otherwise secured in a manner that will make the sign a permanent sign.
      (2)   No temporary sign shall be mounted, attached, affixed, installed or
otherwise secured so as to protrude above the roofline of a structure.
      (3)   All temporary signs shall be secured in such a manner as to prevent
swinging or other significantly noticeable movement that could pose a danger to
people, vehicles or structures.
      (4)   Unless otherwise specifically stated, temporary signs shall not be
illuminated.
       (5)   No temporary sign shall require a foundation, or similar permanent
support.
      (6)   Temporary signs shall not be affixed to any permanent sign or
permanent structure except when a banner sign is permitted to cover a permanent
sign in accordance with this section or when such sign is attached to the
principal building as permitted in this chapter.
      (7)   No streamers, spinning, flashing, windblown devices or similarly
moving devices shall be allowed as part of, or attachments to, temporary signs.
      (8)   Where a temporary sign is designed to have two sign faces (sidewalk
signs or temporary yard signs), such sign faces shall be of the same size and
mounted back-to-back. In the cases of an A-frame sidewalk sign, the sign faces
shall be mounted back-to-back but may have an angular separation between faces

      (9)   For zoning certificate applications related to the establishment of
a new use or change of use within an existing building, where there is existing
permanent sign, a banner sign may be approved for up to sixty (60) consecutive
days to cover the existing permanent signs. Such banner sign shall not exceed
the sign area of the permanent sign and shall require a zoning certificate.
      (10)   Temporary signs shall be constructed of a material that is
substantial enough to withstand typical winds and weather for the duration of
the placement.

temporary signs and to avoid the unsightliness of deteriorating signs and all
safety concerns which accompany such a condition, temporary signs shall be
removed or replaced when such a sign is deteriorated.
   (b)   Temporary Sign Allowances. Table 1117-3 establishes the allowances for
temporary signs in all zoning districts. All sign types are subject to the

effective date of this code, or amendment thereto, that does not conform to the
provisions herein, shall be deemed a legal nonconforming sign and may remain on
a lot of record except as qualified in this subsection. No legal nonconforming
sign shall be enlarged, extended, structurally altered, or reconstructed in any
manner, except as allowed for in this section, and the nonconforming structure
regulations in Chapter
1121: Nonconformities, shall not apply.
      (2)   Legal nonconforming signs shall be maintained in good condition
pursuant to Section
1117.05(g) and may continue until such sign is required to be removed as set
forth in this chapter.
       (3)   A nonconforming sign shall immediately lose its nonconforming
designation and must be brought into compliance with these regulations or be
removed if:
         A.   The sign is structurally altered or replaced except when a sign
is specifically designed and approved for changeable sign faces and such a sign

structure shall not modify the sign structure in any way.
   (b)   Illegal Signs.
      (1)   If any sign is installed, erected, constructed or maintained in
violation of any provision of this chapter, except for nonconforming signs in
compliance with Section

thereof to comply with the provisions of this chapter in the same manner as
Section
1123.06.
      (2)   If the owner or user fails to comply with such notice, and the
owner has not requested an opinion as to the existence of the violation from
the Planning Commission, or, after a reasonable search, cannot be found, the
Zoning Administrator shall cause such graphic or such portion thereof as is
constructed or maintained in violation of this chapter to be taken down; the
expense of which shall be paid by the owner or user in accordance with Section
1117.10(d).
      (3)   Unless clearly specified otherwise, the property owner will be
considered to be the presumptive owner of said sign. However, nothing herein
contained shall prevent the Zoning Administrator, or his designee from adopting
such precautionary measures as may seem to him necessary or advisable in case
of imminent danger to place the graphic in safe condition, the expense of which
shall be paid by the owner of the premises or recovered against him in the
manner as further described in this section.
      (4)   Unattended signs on public property, including but not limited to
parks and rights of way, that have not been placed by the Village, shall be
considered abandoned, and shall therefore be illegal signs. These signs may be
disposed of or destroyed without notice or compensation. Such disposal or
destruction is not subject to appeal.
         
   (c)   Unsafe Signs.
      (1)   When the Zoning Administrator finds, upon investigation, that a

from the Planning Commission, the same may be removed at the expense of the
lessee or owner after ten (10) days of notice for an unsafe or structurally
unsound sign.

amount thereof shall be certified to the County Auditor for collection as a
special assessment against the property on which the sign is located.
   (d)   Fees for Sign Removal.
      (1)   Fees for removal shall be immediately due and payable to the
Village of Centerburg. Notice of such assessment shall be given to the owner in

through a civil action in the appropriate court of law having jurisdiction
thereof and seek such additional orders from a court of competent jurisdiction
as may be necessary from time to time in order to enforce the provisions of
this section.
      (4)   Every owner or occupant of real estate in the Village impliedly
grants a license to the Zoning Administrator, his designee or Village employees
to enter upon real property in the Village without the consent of the owner or
user for the purposes of fulfilling the provisions of this section.

1119.06 GENERAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
    (a)   General Suitability of Land for Development. If the Planning
Commission and the Village Council find that land proposed to be subdivided is
unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding, poor drainage,
topography or inadequate water supply, wastewater treatment facilities,
transportation facilities, or such other conditions as may endanger health,
life or property, and if, from investigations conducted by the public agencies
concerned, it is determined that, in the best interest of the public, the land
should not be developed for the subdivision proposed, the Planning Commission
and the Village Council shall not approve the land for the proposed subdivision
unless adequate methods are advanced by the applicant for solving the problems
that will be created by the development of the land.
   (b)   Projection of Improvements. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided
or developed, the arrangement of streets and utilities in new subdivisions
shall make provision for the proper projection of streets (i.e., provide for
temporary dead-end streets and utilities where street connections can be made
to the adjacent land) as required by the Zoning Administrator. Such
arrangements shall be made to the subdivision boundary or up to the edge of the
phase of buildable lots.
   (c)   Topography, Floodplain Areas, Wetlands, and Natural Areas.

developed unless methods adequate to resolve the problems are formulated by the
applicant and approved by the Planning Commission and upon advice of the Zoning
Administrator.

accepted by the Village for dedication as a public street.
      (9)   Streets within a subdivision which are reasonably expected to be
subject to flooding shall not be accepted by the Village. All streets must be
located at elevations which will make them flood-free, in order that no portion
of the subdivision would become isolated by floods.
      (10)   In the interest of public safety, and as a matter of policy, all
points of ingress and egress shall be located as far as possible from the
intersection of two or more major arterial streets or highways.

platted streets shall be named the same. Street names shall be included on the
preliminary plat and final plat.
      (2)   Street names shall not be confusing, offensive, or otherwise named
in such a manner as to hinder safe or efficient travel.

principal collector, arterial, etc.) on all plats, based on their proposed
functions and the recommendation of any approved street plans. The physical and
geometric design of streets shall be based upon these designations in adapting
the proposed streets to the existing terrain and soils.
      (2)   The standards of the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO), as published in A Policy on Geometric Design
of Highways and Streets, 1984; A Policy on Design Standards for Stopping Sight
Distances, 1971; and subsequent publications modifying those standards by
AASHTO, in effect at the time of final plat submission, shall govern the design
of subdivision streets and abutting Village, county and township roads. The
"Desirable Sight Distance Values" will govern in all but the most unusual
instances, and any lesser values must be recommended by the Village
Administrator before the preliminary design plan is approved by the Planning
Commission.
      (3)   The pavement design shall be calculated and submitted by an Ohio
registered engineer with the preliminary plat approval.
      (4)   The applicant shall be responsible for all required improvements,
including the required pavement width measured from back-to-back of curbs on an
undivided street.
      (5)   When developing along one side of an existing street or roadway
which is included in any approved street plans, the applicant shall be
responsible for one curb, the pavement widening to thoroughfare width of his or
her side, all necessary adjustments to existing pavement, and storm drainage
for the street in accordance with an agreement with the Village Administrator.
Where sight distances or other engineering requirements make it imperative, the
pavement adjustment responsibility shall include the replacement of up to the
entire existing pavement, also in accordance with an agreement with the Village
Administrator.

      (7)   Vertical Alignment.
         A.   All changes in grades shall be connected by vertical curves of a
minimum length in feet equal to thirty (30) times the algebraic difference in
the rate of change of grade expressed in feet per 100 feet. Longer vertical
curves shall be used when needed for sight distances as determined by the
design engineer and approved by the Village Administrator.
         B.   No street grade shall be less than 0.4 percent and on stop
streets, the grade shall not exceed two percent positive or three percent
negative within 100 feet of an intersection with local streets or 150 feet for
all other intersections, unless otherwise approved by the Village
Administrator. The positive is considered going up from the intersection and
the negative is going down from the intersection.
         C.   Whenever the applicant changes the grade of an existing street
outside the limits of the development, and the grade change requires adjustment
to meet existing improvements (streets, driveways, walks, and the like), such
adjustments shall be the responsibility of the applicant, as approved by the
Village Administrator.
   (f)   Special Street Types and Street Requirements. The following
requirements shall apply to special street types or under the specified
circumstances:
      (1)   Temporary Dead-End Streets.
         A.   Temporary dead-end streets shall be permitted only where there
are future plans to continue the street into another phase of the subdivision
or into an adjacent, future subdivision. In such cases, a temporary turnaround
shall be provided with a design approved by the Village Administrator.
         B.   Provisions for maintenance and the removal of the temporary dead-
end street shall be required of any additional plat approvals.
         C.   Temporary dead-end streets longer than 600 feet are prohibited.
         D.   A "T" turnaround (temporary only) may be permitted in-lieu of a
cul-de-sac that is required for permanent dead-end streets. Such turnarounds
shall be designed to allow vehicles to turn around with only one backing-up
movement. See Figure 1119-A. The turnaround area shall be the same width as the
street it abuts and shall be at least seventy-five (75) feet long.

Figure 1119-A: Illustrative example of a temporary "T" turnaround.
         E.   If a dead-end street extends   one lot depth or less past a
street intersection, a "T"   turnaround will not be required.
      (2)   Permanent Dead-End Streets.
         A.   Permanent dead-end streets are prohibited unless they include a
turnaround (cul-de-sac) in accordance with this subsection.
         B.   Permanent dead-end streets shall not exceed 600 feet in length as
measured from the centerline of the intersecting street to the center of the
turn-around. Permanent dead-end streets may be longer where unique topographic
or other physical conditions exist making a through street impractical.
         C.   All permanent dead-end streets shall be designed with a turning
circle having an outside pavement diameter (curb face to curb face) of at least
eighty (80) feet.
      (3)   Streets for Nonresidential Subdivisions.
         A.   Streets serving nonresidential developments (e.g., commercial or
industrial) and accessory parking areas shall be planned to connect with
collector or arterial streets so as not to generate traffic on local access
streets.
         B.   The Village Administrator may require local access streets
(frontage streets) that run parallel to an arterial or collector street to
provide maximum safety and convenience.
      (4)   Half-Streets. The dedication of new half-streets shall not be
permitted. Where a dedicated or platted half-street exists adjacent to the
tract being subdivided, the other half shall be platted.
      (5)   Private Streets.
         A.   Private streets are discouraged.
         B.   Where constructed, a private street shall be constructed to the
minimum standard of a public street in accordance with this code.
         C.   The Village shall not be responsible for maintenance, snow
plowing, cleaning, or provision of similar public street services for private
streets.
         D.   Property owners abutting a private street may request that the
Village accept the street as a public street dedication at a later date, but
the Village shall not be required to accept such dedication.
         E.   In no instance shall the Village accept a private street as a
public dedication until such street is shown to meet all applicable street
design standards required for public streets in this code.
            (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1119.11 SIDEWALKS.
    Sidewalks shall be required in accordance with Section
1115.08(a).
(Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1119.12 UTILITIES.
   (a)   General Requirements for Utilities and Underground Facilities.
      (1)   All public, common, or shared electric, cable, and telephone lines
and other utilities shall be located underground in all residential, office,
commercial and industrial subdivisions and districts, and shall be placed in
their own easement, shown on the final or record plat. These underground
utility requirements shall also apply to any lines required to serve the new
development that extend outside the boundary of the development. The conduits
or cables shall be located within easements or public rights-of-way in separate
trenches, in a manner which will not conflict with other underground services.
      (2)   In industrial subdivisions where the electric power provider
advises the Village that the power load requirements are sufficiently large as
to make underground service impractical or unfeasible, electric, cable, and
telephone lines may be installed overhead along rear lot lines with the
approval by the Village Administrator. Should the Village Administrator approve
an overhead distribution system, all connections to it shall be made
underground. All facilities are to be constructed on one side of the road
without overhead crossovers.
      (3)   Where cable, fiber optic, television, or similar services or
conduit is or will be in operation, the applicant shall install cable or
conduit for such service simultaneously with and in the same manner as electric
and telephone cables are installed, both within the right-of-way and to
individual building connections.
      (4)   All sewer and utility pipelines shall preferably be placed outside
the limits of the pavement or other similar improvements. All excavations for
public utilities made under improved roadway areas shall be properly backfilled
with approved granular materials thoroughly compacted in place and repaved,
resealed, or otherwise returned to the same improved condition, subject to
approval by the Village Administrator.
      (5)   All storm drainage grates shall be constructed to allow bicycles to
pass over the grate safely and shall have the words "No Dumping, Drains to
Stream", or similar, cast into the grate.
   (b)   Sanitary Sewers. The following requirements shall govern sanitary
sewer improvements:
      (1)   Where an adequate existing public wastewater treatment system is
reasonably accessible, in the determination of the Village Administrator,
public sanitary sewers shall be installed to adequately serve all lots,
including lateral connections to the public system. Public sewer system
extensions shall meet the requirements of the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency and Village standards.
      (2)   Combinations of sanitary sewers and storm sewers shall be
prohibited.
      (3)   Sanitary sewers shall be extended through all lots and rights-of-
way within the approved plat.
   (c)   Public Water Supply. The following shall govern water supply
improvements:
      (1)   The applicant shall construct a system of water mains and
appurtenances and connect them with the public water supply and provide a
connection for each lot.
      (2)   The design of the water supply shall comply with the design
standards established by the Del-Co Water Company.
      (3)   The type, size, and location of water lines shall be approved by
the Village Administrator.
      (4)   Water mains shall be extended through all lots and rights-of-way
within the approved plat.
       (5)   Fire hydrants shall be provided at a ratio of one hydrant per 300
feet of lineal street frontage.
   (d)   Electric, Communication, Cable, and Fiber Optic.
      (1)   Electric service and communication service shall be provided within
each subdivision.
      (2)   Gas service and fiber optics shall be required where reasonably
accessible.
      (3)   All electric, telephone, cable, fiber optic, and similar
transmission lines shall be designed and installed in compliance with the
applicable standards of these regulations and the authority having
jurisdiction.
         (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1119.13 GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE.
   (a)   Green Infrastructure Techniques.
      (1)   The Village encourages the use of green infrastructure techniques
because of their connection to sustainable development practices and
environmental quality. The proper use of green infrastructure can dramatically
improve storm water runoff quality, decrease runoff volume, protect downstream
streams and rivers, and create more interesting places to live.
      (2)   The following green infrastructure techniques may be incorporated
into new subdivisions with approval from the Zoning Administrator, Village's
engineer, or engineering consultants to the Village, as applicable, provided
that the applicant submits documentation that the proposed green infrastructure
technique is effective and will equal or exceed the function of traditional
infrastructure techniques and meet the requirements of this code:
         A.   Narrower pavement widths;
         B.   Narrower right-of-way widths;
         C.   Grassy swales and shoulders without curb and gutter;
         D.   Pedestrian walkways that do not constitute the sidewalks required
by this code;
         E.   Permeable pavements (e.g., pavers, permeable concrete, permeable
asphalt pavement);
         F.   Bioretention swales;
         G.   Planter boxes;
         H.   Curb extensions; or
         I.   Other techniques.
      
   (b)   Criteria for Green Infrastructure Waivers. The Zoning Administrator,
Village Administrator, or engineering consultants to the Village, as
applicable. may grant a green infrastructure waiver for use of the green
infrastructure techniques provided:
      (1)   The techniques will utilize the landscape or other natural features
to reduce, slow, filter, and/or absorb storm water runoff from streets, parking
lots, and buildings in a method that equals or exceeds the existing
infrastructure requirements of the Village;
      (2)   The techniques are consistent with best management practices;
      (3)   Covenants or other agreements have been presented to the Village,
in a format acceptable by the Village's legal counsel, that provide for the
long-term maintenance of any approved green infrastructure; and
      (4)   The technique has been designed by a professional engineer and is
accompanied by documentation stating that the proposed technique does not pose
a threat to the public safety.
         (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
CHAPTER 1121
Nonconformities
1121.01   Purpose.
1121.02   General provisions.
1121.03   Nonconforming uses.
1121.04   Nonconforming structures and sites.
1121.05   Nonconforming lots of record.
1121.06   Nonconforming signs.
1121.07   Nonconforming fences and landscaping walls.
1121.08   Repair and maintenance.
1121.01 PURPOSE.
   Within the districts established by this code, some lots, structures, uses
of lands or structures, or combinations thereof may exist which were lawful
prior to the effective date or amendment of this code, but that are prohibited,
regulated, or restricted under the terms of this code. The legitimate interests
of those who lawfully established these nonconformities are herein recognized
by providing for the continuance of such uses, subject to regulations limiting
their completion, restoration, reconstruction, extension, and/or substitution.
Nevertheless, while it is the intent of this code that such nonconformities be
allowed to continue until removed, they should not be encouraged to survive,
unless otherwise allowed in this chapter or specifically addressed in this
code. This chapter has the further purposes for nonconformities:
   (a)   To permit their continuance but control nonconformities so as to
minimize any adverse effect on the adjoining properties and development;
   (b)   To regulate their maintenance and repair;
   (c)   To restrict their rebuilding if substantially destroyed;
   (d)   To require their permanent discontinuance if not operated for certain
periods of time; and
   (e)   To require conformity if they are discontinued, and to bring about
eventual conformity in accordance with the objectives of the Village's adopted
plans and this code.
      (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1121.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Any structure, land, or use of land or a structure that existed at the
time of the effective date of this code and that was legally established under
a previous code amendment or versions, may be continued even if such use,
building, structure, or use of land does not conform to the provisions of this
code.
   (b)   An applicant for any review procedure (e.g., zoning certificate
approval, site plan review, variance, etc.) that involves a nonconformity shall
bear the burden of proof in demonstrating that the use, building, or structure,
or combination thereof, is a legal nonconformity.
   (c)   Passage of this code in no way legalizes any illegal uses existing at
the time of its adoption.
   (d)   Nonconformities and Variances.
      (1)   Whenever any nonconformity has been changed so that the use,
structure, or condition conforms to the requirements of this code, such use,
structure, or condition shall no longer be defined as a nonconformity, nor
shall the property or structure be returned to the former nonconformity.
      (2)   When a property owner or authorized agent is granted a variance for
a nonconformity that addresses the nonconformity, the structure or lot shall no
longer be considered nonconforming. In no case shall the resolved nonconformity
be expanded or altered to create further nonconformities.
      (3)   If a property owner or authorized agent is granted a variance for a
nonconformity that addresses some nonconformities but additional
nonconformities continue, the structure or condition that remains a
nonconformity shall still be subject to the provisions of this chapter.
         (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1121.03 NONCONFORMING USES.
   Where, at the time of adoption of this code, lawful uses of land or
structures exist that would not be permitted by the regulations of this code,
the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful and provided:
   (a)   No such nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land or structure than was occupied at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this code.
   (b)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved, in whole or in part, to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this code.
   (c)   No additional structures shall be constructed on a lot with a
nonconforming use unless such new structure complies with the requirements of
this code and the applicable zoning district.
   (d)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building.
   (e)   Change or Substitution of Nonconforming Use.
      (1)   If no structural alterations are made that increase the
nonconformity, a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same or of a more restricted use, as determined by the
Planning Commission. Such determination shall be made at a public hearing held
in the same manner as an appeal (See Section
1103.14.), including notice, but the appeals review considerations of Section
1103.14(e) shall not apply. At the hearing, the Planning Commission shall make
a determination if the proposed use, which must be a permitted use in the
applicable zoning district, is similar in nature and intensity, or is a more
restricted use, allowable as a change or substitution under this section.
      (2)   Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a less intensive
nonconforming use in accordance with this code, such use shall not thereafter
be changed to a more intensive nonconforming use.
      (3)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the applicable zoning district in which such structure
is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
   (f)   Termination of Nonconforming Uses.
      (1)   Termination of Use through Discontinuance.
         A.   When any nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned upon a
lot in the Village for more than six (6) months, or a total of eighteen (18)
months in any three (3)-year time period, any new use shall conform to the
regulations of the district in which it is located, and the nonconforming use
may not thereafter be resumed. The intent to continue a nonconforming use shall
not be evidence of its continuance.
         B.   There may be cases when a structure, or structure and premises in
combination, may not be converted to a conforming use because of the original
architecture, floor plan, construction, and design (e.g., townhouses in a
single-family residentially zoned area). In these cases, the Planning
Commission may determine that the nonconforming use may continue if the
nonconforming use is the original use of the structure and/or premises.
Appropriate safeguards, conditions and design standards may be required by the
Planning Commission so as to minimize the impact of such continuance on the
area.
      (2)   Termination of Use by Damage or Destruction.
         A.   If a building containing a nonconforming residential use, in any
district, is damaged or destroyed to any extent, such structure and use may be
reestablished on the same lot provided the structure and use meet the same size
in height and footprint, as well as complying with the same setbacks as
previously existed.
         B.   If any building containing a nonconforming use, other than a
residential use, is damaged, but not to an extent greater than fifty percent
(50%) of the principal structure's reconstruction value, such structure and use
may be reestablished on the same lot to the same size and intensity of use as
was previously existing immediately prior to the damage. Such reestablishment
of the use shall require the issuance of a zoning certificate, which must be
issued within six months of the damage or the use shall not be reestablished.
         C.   If any building containing a nonconforming use, other than a
residential use, is damaged beyond fifty percent (50%) of the principal
structure's reconstruction value, such structure and use may only be
reestablished in accordance with this code.
         D.   Determination of the reconstruction value shall be made by three
(3) practicing building construction contractors, one to be appointed by the
owner, one to be appointed by the Village and the third to be selected by the
mutual consent of the two parties.
            (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1121.04 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND SITES.
   A nonconforming structure or site may continue to be used or occupied by a
use permitted in the applicable zoning district so long as it remains otherwise
lawful and does not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the following
provisions:
   (a)   Any nonconforming structure or site may be enlarged, maintained,
repaired, or altered provided, however, no such enlargement, maintenance,
repair or alteration shall either create an additional nonconformity or
increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of all or any part of such
structure or site, unless otherwise specified in this code.
   (b)   A nonconforming structure shall not be relocated in whole or in part
to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the entire structure
shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the applicable zoning district
after being relocated.
   (c)   The principal use of a nonconforming building may be changed to any
other use permitted in the applicable zoning district as long as the new use
complies with all regulations of this code specified for such use, except the
regulations to which the building did not conform prior to the change in use.
   (d)   Where a government entity acquires a portion of a lot for a public
purpose that results in reduction in a required yard or building setback below
that required in the applicable zoning district, such government entity shall
be required to file a variance, on behalf of the affected property owner, to
formally allow for such reduction.
   (e)   Damage or Destruction of a Nonconforming Structure Containing a
Conforming Use.
      (1)   If a nonconforming structure is damaged, but not to an extent
greater than fifty percent (50%) of the structure's reconstruction value, such
structure and use may be reestablished on the same lot to the same size and
intensity of use as was previously existing immediately prior to the damage.
Such reestablishment of the use shall require the issuance of a building permit
within six (6) months of the initial damage. If an owner rebuilds a legally
nonconforming structure under this provision, they may expand the structure
provided any expansion or change does not increase the nonconformity that
existed prior to the damage.
      (2)   If a nonconforming structure is damaged beyond fifty percent (50%)
of the structure's reconstruction value, such structure shall only be rebuilt
in compliance with the requirements of this code. Such reconstruction shall
require the application and issuance of all necessary zoning and building
permits.
      (3)   If the owner voluntarily removes a nonconforming structure, or
reduces the nonconformity of a nonconforming structure that has not been
damaged or destroyed, that owner shall not be permitted to rebuild the
structure to the original height, size, or setback.
      (4)   The determination of the reconstruction value shall be made in the
same manner as established in Section
1121.03(f)(1)B.
         (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
 
1121.05 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   A lot of record which does not comply with the lot or yard regulations of
the district in which it is located on the effective date of this code or any
amendment thereto which made it nonconforming, may be used as follows:
   (a)   If occupied by a building, such building may be maintained, repaired
or altered. However, the building may not be enlarged in floor area unless the
such enlargement complies with the applicable front, side, and rear yard
setbacks of the applicable zoning district.
   (b)   If vacant, the lot may be used provided that:
      (1)   No adjoining vacant lot or parcel of land was owned by the same
owner on the effective date of this code;
      (2)   Not owning adjoining land, other vacant land adjoining the lot
cannot be equitably acquired; and
      (3)   All other regulations of this code, except the lot area and lot
width regulations, shall be complied with.
         (Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1121.06 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   See Section
1117.10(a) for the regulation of nonconforming signs.
(Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1121.07 NONCONFORMING FENCES AND LANDSCAPING WALLS.
   See Section
1111.03 for the regulation of nonconforming fences and landscaping walls.
(Ord. 2023-16. Passed 6-5-23.)
1121.08 REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or
replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent
not exceeding sixty percent (60%) of the current replacement cost of the
nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of the structure as the case
may be provided that the footprint and height of the structure as it existed,
when it became nonconforming, shall not be increased unless in accordance with
this chapter. The value of such work shall be determined in the same manner as
established in Section
1121.03(f)(1)B.
   (b)   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening
or restoring to safe condition of any building, or part thereof, declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, including,
but not limited to the Zoning Administrator or building inspector, upon order
of such official. Where appropriate, a building permit for such activities
shall be required.

Association is adopted and incorporated by reference.
   The provisions of Sections
1301.03 and
1301.04, to the extent of any conflict with the provisions of the Ohio Basic
Building Code - 4101:2, shall establish the standards for the enforcement of
Part Thirteen - Building Code.
   All of the provisions of CABO One and Two Family Dwelling Code are adopted
hereby, except plumbing standards and requirements as are modified by the Ohio
Basic Building Code - 4101:2-51.
(Ord. 1998-8. Passed 6-1-98.)
1301.02 FILE AND DISTRIBUTION COPIES.

buildings.
(Ord. 1998-8. Passed 6-1-98.)
1301.04 INSULATION STANDARDS.
   The “R” values indicated below apply only to insulating materials, and as
used in this section, the term “R” (Thermal Resistance) is the numerical
reciprocal of thermal conductance (R=1/c). It is a measure of the resistance of
a material to heat flow; the higher the “R” value, the better the insulating
value. “R” values per inch of thickness will vary for different insulating
materials. Therefore, a given “R” value may require a greater or lesser
thickness of insulation.
   Expressed in minimum “R” values, the minimum standards for insulating
ceilings and walls shall be as follows:
 
Flat Roof   Exterior   Exterior   Exterior
Deck*   Masonry Wall   Frame Wall   Doors   Windows
   Construction   Construction
________________________________________________________________________________
      Ceiling      Wall   Ceiling      Wall   Stormed or      Stormed or
R-11      R-24      R-6      R-24      R-13   Insulated Type   Insulated Glass
   *Construction where rigid roof insulation and exposed structural system is
used. When a roof cavity is available, use standards listed for ceilings.
   Minimum “R” values for floor areas over unheated basements, unheated crawl
spaces or unheated garages:
 
Structural Slab   Wood and Metal Framing
   R-7         R-11
   A basement, crawl space or garage shall be considered to be unheated unless
it is provided with a positive heat supply to maintain a minimum temperature of
fifty degrees Fahrenheit.
   Insulation of floors may be omitted over heated basement areas or where the
basement sidewalls are insulated at R-6.
   Foundation walls of basements need not be insulated except where habitable
rooms are provided or where fifty percent (50%) or more of the wall section is
above grade level.
   Slab-on-grade floors shall be insulated down the exposed edge and under the
slab twenty- four inches, or down the exposed edge of the slab and along the
inside of the foundation for twenty-four inches. In such cases, the insulating
material shall be of the rigid type with a minimum “R” value of five.
(Ord. 1998-8. Passed 6-1-98.)
1301.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Whoever violates any provision or fails to conform with any of the
requirements of this Part Thirteen - Building Code, where no other penalty is
provided, or fails to comply with any order made thereunder or violates any
detailed statement of specifications or plans submitted and approved thereunder
shall severally for every such violation and noncompliance, respectively, be
fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned not more than
six months, or both. Each day during or on which any condition in violation
continues may be considered a separate offense.
   (b)   The application of the penalty provided in subsection (a) hereof shall
not be deemed to prevent the enforced removal of prohibited conditions.

1325.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Village Council of Centerburg, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The Village of Centerburg has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Centerburg as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by Village of Centerburg.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  
      (1)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and I
or maps are adopted:
         A.   Flood Insurance Study Knox County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Knox County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective July 7, 2009.
         B.    Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
         C.    Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Centerburg as required by Section
1325.04 (c).
      (2)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and I or studies are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations.
Such maps and/or studies are on file at 8 North Clayton Street Centerburg, Ohio
43011.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Centerburg, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2009-09. Passed 7-6-09.)
1325.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure:  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal:  A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   Base Flood: The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one-hundred ( 100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE): The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement:  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor: See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management):  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill:  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM):  An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood depths
of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are
determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood depths of 1
to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from
the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone Band Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS):  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation plus two (2) feet of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway:  
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard:  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure:  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by Village of Centerburg's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis:  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA):
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR):
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR):
A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies
with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management
criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps,
Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction:  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Centerburg
Flood Insurance Rate Map, January 6, 1982, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer:  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction:  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement,. or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement:  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance: A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation:  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;

shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (k)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of Village of
Centerburg, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Centerburg have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Centerburg's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the Village of
Centerburg boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
Village of Centerburg suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the Village of Centerburg has
assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (l)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and I or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and I or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section 
1325.05 .
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, flood way data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (m)   Substantial Damage Determinations.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.    Determine whether damaged structures are located in special
flood hazard areas;
         B.    Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.    Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially
damaged structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior
to repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsections (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Village of Centerburg specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1325.01 (k)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.

to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated flood way if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(2)A. to K. have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.

attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Knox County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
