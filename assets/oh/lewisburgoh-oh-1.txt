OF LEWISBURG, PREBLE COUNTY, OHIO; TO REPEAL ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH;
TO PUBLISH THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER THEREIN; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
That Whereas, the Council of the Village of Lewisburg, Ohio, has had the matter
of codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time;
and
Whereas, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification; and
Whereas, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter to
be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before the
Council;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE VILLAGE OF LEWISBURG,
PREBLE COUNTY, OHIO, AS FOLLOWS:
SECTION 1: That the ordinances of the Village of Lewisburg, Ohio, of a general
and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Lewisburg, Ohio.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk, attached to this Ordinance as a part hereof, and
filed with the permanent records of the Village of Lewisburg, Ohio.
SECTION 2: That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions of
the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 4 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to October 1, 1988, which are inconsistent with any provision of
the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

that there exists an imperative need for the earliest publication and
distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of the
Village, so as to facilitate administration, daily operation and avoid
practical and legal entanglements.

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

through (A) (6) of the section, the Council shall declare the office of the
affected member of Council to be vacated by a motion adopted by a majority vote
of the remaining members of the Council. The Council shall provide written
notice of its intention to consider whether to declare a vacancy in the Council
to any affected Council member accused of conduct which gives rise to his
removal for the reasons stated in division (A) (1), (A) (3), (A) (4), or (A)
(6) of this section. Such notice shall set forth the proffered grounds for

by the Council shall serve for the unexpired term. If the vacancy occurs at
least seven days prior to the date when candidates for the office of Council
must file their nominating petitions and more than two years remain in the term
of the incumbent who created the vacancy, the person appointed by the Council
shall serve until a successor is elected at the next regular municipal election
for the remainder of the unexpired term. The person elected for the unexpired
term at the next regular municipal election shall take office on the first day
of January following his election;

voted on the action shall later be determined to have vacated his office due to
the occurrence of any of the events described in division (A) of this section.
   Sec. 3.05 Election Contests; Determination of Qualification.

however, the general laws of Ohio governing the matter of election contests
shall be applicable under this Charter.

   It shall be the responsibility of the Council to determine the annual salary

changing the salary of members of Council shall be adopted no later than 6
months prior to any election of Council members.
   Sec. 3.07 Council Organization and Rules; Meetings of Council.
   (A)   The Council shall be a continuing body, but shall meet for purpose of
organization no later than the 15th of January of each even-number-year, or if
such day shall fall upon a legal holiday, then on the next following business
day. At the organizational meeting, the newly elected members of Council shall
take the oath of office, and the Council shall proceed to elect a President of
Council, and the Council may transact such other business as may come before
it.

members, the rules of the Council, which shall not conflict with this Charter,
and which shall remain in effect until amended, changed, or repealed by a
motion adopted by a majority vote of the members of Council. The rules of
Council shall go into immediate effect unless a later date is specified in the
rules or the motion adopting the rules. The rules of Council shall provide for
the number, composition, and manner of appointments of committees of Council,
if any; the frequency, dates, and times of regular meetings of the Council,
provided that at least two regular meetings of the Council shall be scheduled
each month; and such other matters as Council shall determine to be necessary

Council shall become the Mayor and shall serve as Mayor until the next regular
municipal election. At such election, a Mayor shall be elected to serve for the
unexpired term, if any; if not, for a full term.
   
   Sec. 3.09 Clerk of Council.
   The Council shall appoint, by motion adopted by a majority vote of its
members, a person to serve as Clerk of Council. The Clerk of Council shall

control of the Council. The Council shall establish the compensation of the

legislation.
   Sec. 4.06 Content of Emergency Legislation.
   Each emergency ordinance or resolution shall determine that the ordinance or
resolution is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace,
health, safety, or welfare, or to meet an emergency in the government of the
Municipality, and shall contain a statement of the necessity for the emergency.
No ordinance or resolution granting a franchise or fixing rates to be charged

      (1)   Appropriation of money for the current expenses of the
Municipality.

after their passage by the Council.
   Sec. 4.08 Authentication.

   (A)   Each ordinance or resolution, or section or subsection thereof, that
is revised or amended shall set forth those portions, sections or subsections
as revised or amended, and shall repeal the portions, sections, or subsections
so revised or amended. This requirement shall not prevent the amendment of an
ordinance or resolution by the addition of new sections or subsections without
setting forth the full text of the former ordinance or resolution; nor shall
this section prevent repeals by implication.
   (B)   Except in the case of a codification, recodification, or the
publication, in book form, of ordinances and resolutions, a separate vote shall
be taken on each ordinance or resolution proposed to be amended.

   (C)   That the committee designated by the petitioners to file said petition
shall consist of three (3) members.
   In all other respects the procedure with reference to initiative and
referendum petitions shall be the same as that provided in the General Law
sections referenced above then in effect. Whenever the Council is required to
pass more than one (1) ordinance or resolution to complete the legislation
necessary to complete and pay for any public improvement, the referendum shall
apply only to the first ordinance or resolution to be passed and not to any
subsequent ordinance or resolution in the series relating thereto.
   Sec. 10.02 Recall.
   Any elective officer of a municipal corporation may be removed from office
by the qualified voters of such municipal corporation. The procedure to effect
such removal shall be:
   (A)   A petition signed by qualified electors equal in number to at least
twenty five per cent of the total votes cast at the most recent regular
municipal election, and demanding the election of a successor to the person
sought to be removed, shall be filed with the board of elections. Such petition
shall contain a general statement in not more the two hundred words of the
grounds upon which the removal of such person is sought. The form, sufficiency,
and regularity of any such petition shall be determined as provided in the
general election laws.
   (B)   If the petition is sufficient, and if the person whose removal is
sought does not resign within five days after the sufficiency of the petition
has been determined, the legislative authority shall thereupon order and fix a
day for holding an election to determine the question of the removal of the
elective officer, and for the selection of a successor to each officer named in
said petition. Such election shall be held not less than thirty nor more than
forty days from the time of the finding of the sufficiency of such petition.
The election authorities shall publish notice and make all arrangements for
holding such election, which shall be conducted and the result thereof returned
and declared in all respects as are the results of regular municipal elections.
   (C)   The nomination of candidates to succeed each officer sought to be
removed shall be made, without the intervention of a primary election, by
filing with the election authorities, at least twenty days prior to such
special election, a petition proposing a person for each such office, signed by
the electors equal in number to ten per cent of the total votes cast at the
most recent regular municipal election for the head of the ticket.
   (D)   The ballots of such recall election shall, with respect to each person
whose removal is sought, submit the question:
“Shall (name of person) be removed from the office of (name of office) by
recall?”
Immediately following each such question, there shall be printed on the
ballots, the two propositions in the order set forth:
      “For the recall of (name of person).”
“Against the recall of (name of person).”
Immediately to the left of the proposition shall be placed a square in which
the electors may vote for either of such propositions.
Under each of such questions shall be placed the names of candidates to fill
the vacancy. The name of the officer whose removal is sought shall not appear
on the ballot as a candidate to succeed the officers’ self.
In any such election, if a majority of the votes cast on the question of
removal are affirmative, the person whose removal is sought shall be removed
from the office upon the announcement of the official canvass of that election,
and the candidate receiving the plurality of the votes cast for candidates for
that office shall be declared elected. The successor of any person so removed
shall hold office during the unexpired term of the successor’s predecessor. The
question of the removal of any officer shall not be submitted to the electors
until such officer has served for at least one year of the term during which he
is sought to be recalled. The method of removal provided in this section, is in
addition to such other methods as are provided by law. If, at any such recall
election, the incumbent whose removal is sought is not recalled, the incumbent
shall be repaid the incumbent’s actual and legitimate expenses for such
election from the treasury of the municipal corporation, but such sum shall not
exceed fifty per cent of the sum that the incumbent is by law permitted to
expend as a candidate at any regular municipal election.

the same as the prior ordinance.

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

employers in the same job title or job description, credit for years of service
shall include years of service the employee provided at another municipality or
political subdivision, which shall be determined by the Municipal Manager at
the time of the employee's hire date in conjunction with the Village's offer of
employment. Paid vacation must be taken by the qualified employee within one
year after the end of the first service year, or date of hire in the event of a
lateral hire, to which the vacation is awarded or else it is forfeited. The
Village Administrator may allow vacation to be taken within the first year of
hire for a lateral hire as negotiated at the time of hire. However, qualified
employees, upon giving written notice to the Fiscal Officer, may carry forward
one week (or 40 hours equivalent), but no more than one week (or 40 hours
equivalent) of their awarded paid vacation. Qualified employees are prohibited
from working for the Village during the paid vacation period, unless requested
by the Municipal Manager in an emergency for the preservation of the public,
health, safety, or peace. (Ord. 2023-18. Passed 11-1-23.)
      (5)   When a qualified employee’s employment relationship with the

for that calendar year shall be immediately calculated and paid within one week
of termination at the qualified employee’s then current rate of regular pay.
      (6)   Qualified employees may receive their vacation pay on the pay date
immediately preceding their vacation by notifying their supervisor in writing
of such a request, with the supervisor in turn notifying the Village Fiscal
Officer for payroll purposes. The written request shall be made at least one
week in advance of the pre-vacation pay date or the privilege is forfeited;
i.e., the vacation pay will be paid in the normal pay period.
      (7)   Paid holidays are not counted as paid vacation time, even if they

family” means the employee’s actual household members, or in the case of
funerals, those persons who are within three degrees of consanguinity of the
employee.
      (4)   Sick leave shall be deducted in increments of no less than four
hours per leave.
      (5)   Qualified employees may only use sick leave upon approval of their
department head or the Village Fiscal Officer, or in the absence of both, the
Mayor. Approval for sick leave must be requested by the employee at the
earliest reasonable moment and should be done in non-emergency situations,
before the work day to which leave is granted. For any sick leave over and
above three consecutive work days, a physician’s certificate must be filed with
the Village Fiscal Officer substantiating the reason for the sick leave.
      (6)   Borrowing upon future sick leave will not be allowed for any
qualified employees, unless approved by Council first for “good cause” shown.
To provide “good cause”, a signed statement of “good cause” from a licensed
physician is essential, but not necessarily sufficient.
      (7)   Unused sick leave for a qualified employee cannot be transferred to
a new source of employment for such qualified employee, from the standpoint of
the Village. Unused sick leave is not affected by transfers of employment from
one job within the Village to another job within the Village.
      (8)   Qualified employees beginning employment with the Village who are
leaving another public sector job may transfer in unused sick leave days up to
the limits specified under subsection (c)(2) hereof, at the time they take on
employment with the Village. However, should the qualified employee leave
Village employment prior to being with the Village for a period of one year,
the transfer in of sick leave benefits shall be void for purposes of payout
and/our outward transfer.
         (Ord. 2004-04. Passed 2-5-04.)

qualified employee, shall be awarded for the following days:

      (2)   If any of such holidays fall on a Saturday, the paid holiday shall
be celebrated on the Friday before the Saturday for fringe benefit purposes,
and if any of the holidays fall on a Sunday, the paid holiday shall be
celebrated on the Monday following the Sunday for fringe benefit purposes.
         (Ord. 2023-18. Passed 11-1-23.)
   (e)   Hospitalization. Paid hospitalization insurance shall be available to
any qualified employee who requests such benefits from the Village. Council
shall determine on an annual or other convenient term basis which group
employee hospitalization insurance contract is best suited for the needs of
qualified employees and/or the Village in order that these benefits may be made
available to qualified employees. In accordance with subsection (a)(1)D. of
this Section
151.03, if Council has determined that qualified employees must pay for part of
their own hospitalization insurance, then the Fiscal Officer is authorized to
and shall deduct the qualified employees share of the premium/costs from the
qualified employee’s pay checks as necessary for purposes of paying the
hospitalization insurance.
   For full-time employees who do not request and waive paid hospitalization
insurance benefits, they shall be paid additional wage compensation in the sum
of two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50) per hour. This will be paid based on the
normal payroll practice and will be subject to all applicable withholdings.
This waiver of paid hospitalization insurance benefits will only be made by an
employee that is on another health policy. Proof of this separate coverage will
be required by the employee prior to their waiver. Should an employee waive
paid hospitalization insurance benefits and then later need the Village’s paid
hospitalization insurance benefits, their hourly wage will be decreased by two
dollars and fifty cents ($2.50) per hour, since they will no longer be waiving
the Village’s paid hospitalizaiton insurance benefits.
(Ord. 2022-06. Passed 6-2-22.)
   (f)   Retirement Plans. For a qualified employee who desires to be or is a
part of the Public Employees Retirement System ("PERS") or the Police and
Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund ("P & F"), the Village shall pay the
employer share of "PERS" or "P & F" and deduct the qualified employee's share
of "PERS" or "P & F" from his paycheck. Nothing in this section or this chapter
shall be construed to admit into or prohibit any employee or official (elected
or appointed) from participation in ("PERS") or ("P & F"), as this is
controlled by State statute and/or regulations. (Ord. 1987-13. Passed 8-5-87.)
   (g)   Termination Benefits. Whenever a qualified employee has served the
Village for at least one year from his beginning employment date, and whenever
the qualified employee’s service to the Village is terminated, for whatever
reason, including death, retirement, discharge, job change, resignation, or
otherwise, the termination shall have the following effect on the qualified
employee’s benefits:
      (1)   Unused paid vacation time shall be paid to the qualified employee,
with no fringe benefits accruing or awarded to the qualified employee during
this post-termination theoretical time span, except “PERS” or “P&F” (employer’s
share).
      (2)   Unused sick leave time up to 960 hours shall be divided by two and
paid to the qualified employee, with no other fringe benefits accruing or
awarded to the qualified employee during this post-termination theoretical time
span, except “PERS” or “P&F” (employer’s share). The theoretical time span
mentioned in this subsection shall be theoretically separate and apart from the
theoretical time span mentioned in subsection (g)(1).
      (3)   Paid holiday benefits shall terminate on a qualified employee’s
termination date, irrespective of the theoretical time span mentioned in
subsection (g)(1) and (2).
      (4)   The employer’s share of “PERS” or “P&F” benefits shall terminate on
a qualified employee’s termination date, except that which must be paid as a
result of subsection (g)(1) and (2).
         (Ord. 2004-06. Passed 2-5-04.)
                       
   (h)   Deductions.
      (1)   While not directly a monetary "fringe benefit", the following may
be deducted from a qualified employee's paycheck, by the Village Clerk, as a
service to the qualified employee:
         A.   Employee's share of "PERS" or "P & F."

      (2)   Any amounts to be deducted from any employee's pay shall be so
stated in writing requesting such deduction, unless otherwise required by
local, state or federal statute.
         (Ord. 1987-13. Passed 8-5-87.)

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipalty and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's ourt shall make a written
order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court, continuing the
same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee court a
condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall transmit to
the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers in the case,
and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the clerk of the
transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the defendant by
ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages

more than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)    The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
181.051  of this Chapter.
               (d)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)    For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
181.03  of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
181.051  of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (5)    If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties

amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and

      (6)    The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any

lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is

the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

deducted and withheld.

terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video

      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and

Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.

Section
181.03 (23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section

telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a

the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession

all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such

      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B) (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and

under the possession of one of the following:

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal

         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)    The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation

agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)    An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
181.081  of this Chapter.
   (G)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the

five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is

municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations

income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
181.03  of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
181.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit

basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
181.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
181.062  of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is

member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may

         (a)    Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as
paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal
amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be

provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the

liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the

installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration

following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
181.091  of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)    For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)    An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's

the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
181.10  of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of

cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
181.091  of this Chapter for that year.

was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that

municipal income tax on such municipal taxable income to another municipal
corporation, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this Chapter
181  of the amount so paid by him or in his behalf to such other municipal
corporation. The credit shall not exceed the tax assessed by this Chapter
181  on such municipal taxable income earned in such other municipal

plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 2015-13. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
181.081  of this Chapter.

181.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.

should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
181.096  of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
181.096 , the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
181.096  of this Chapter.

181.081  of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the tax
administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
181.092  of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
181.092  of this Chapter, the provision in Section
181.092  of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
181.051  of this Chapter.
      (1)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
181.051  of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
181.052  of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 2015-13. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 2015-13. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
(Ord. 2015-13. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
181.19  of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of
Section
181.19  of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed
beyond the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
181.096  of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
(Ord. 2015-13. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the

agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
181.18  of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
181.10  of this Chapter.
   (E)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in

entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the

fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped, rounding down to
the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a
document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document.
(Ord. 2015-13. Passed 11-9-15.)

records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths; provided that the powers

respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under a municipal corporation
income tax ordinance or resolution adopted in accordance with this chapter;
   (B)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax

Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (H)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
   (I)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding

      (Ord. 2015-13. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 2015-13. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 2015-13. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
181.10  of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
181.99  of this Chapter.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
181.10  of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
181.99  of this Chapter for a violation of
181.15  of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 2015-13. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-13. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 2015-13. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
181.15  of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 2015-13. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 2015-13. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)    No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)    A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 2015-13. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
181.18  of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
181.096  of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
181.18  of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to
which the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that
the amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less
than the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the
appellant's assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the
overpayment as provided by Section
181.096  of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
           (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition
of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-13. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.20 ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the legislative
authority of the Municipality has the authority, by Ordinance or Resolution, to
adopt rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.
(Ord. 2015-13. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.21 RECONCILIATION WITH STATE LAW.
   (A)   Whenever any provisions of this Chapter
181  conflicts with any provision of ORC 718, now or in the future, the
provisions of ORC 718 shall govern.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator is authorized to satisfy, carry out, and comply
with any mandate either in this Chapter
181  or ORC 718 so that this Chapter
181  and ORC 718 are compatible.
(Ord. 2015-13. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.97 COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall
continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the
aforesaid period are fully paid and any and all suits and prosecutions for the
collection of taxes or for the punishment of violations of this chapter have
been fully terminated, subject to the limitations contained in Section
181.19 .

this chapter shall be due on the date provided in Section
181.091  as though the same were continuing.
(Ord. 2015-13. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.98 SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax imposed
against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the

defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or
private agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of
the person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any

this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that subsection.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this subsection may recover the

residential property" does not include any private property on which is located
one or more structures that are used as a home, residence or sleeping place by
two or more persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in
the structure or structures.
   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the

   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
   (e)   Council hereby finds as a fact that all streets and highways within
the Village, which are not State highways, interstate highways, or State
routes, have been broken up for purposes of arterial traffic by means of stop
signs, yield signs, or other traffic control signals and devices.
   (f)   Every street and highway within the Village, which is not a State
highway, interstate highway, or State route, is hereby declared to not be a
through highway.

hereof are the following streets and highways, which are not exclusive of
others:

313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,

R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.

         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court

subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and

      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,

As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may

alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an

this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court’s indigent drivers’ alcohol

any aspect of the person’s trial or sentence, the appeal itself does not stay
the operation of the suspension.
   (m)   Subsection (a)(1)J. of this section does not apply to a person who

bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a

Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s

      (3)   An employer, school official or official affiliated with a
religious event is not liable in damages in a civil action for any injury,
death or loss to person or property that allegedly arises from, or is related
to, the fact that the employer, school official, or official affiliated with a
religious event provided the holder of a probationary driver’s license with the
written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.
The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall make available at no cost a form to serve
as the written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section,

vehicular travel or parking with more than one person who is not a family
member occupying the vehicle unless the probationary license holder is
accompanied by the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or

attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving
violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the
person is issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction
over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months
or the date the holder attains the age of seventeen years, whichever occurs

under subsection (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for driving privileges without being accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted. If a person is convicted of, pleads
guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a second or
subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the violation may
terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under
subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
   (d)   No holder of a probationary license shall operate a motor vehicle upon

installed in the motor vehicle by its manufacturer, and each occupant of the
vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or
is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest of or commencing a
prosecution of a person for such violation.
   (g)   As used in this section:

if the stepparent has not adopted the probationary license holder;
         G.   An eligible adult, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4507.05.
      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets. “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a
violation of any statute or ordinance regulating pedestrians or the parking of

age of eighteen years and no holder of a probationary driver’s license shall
drive a motor vehicle on any street, highway, or property used by the public
for purposes of vehicular traffic or parking while using in any manner an
electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

under this section and who, during the suspension, operates any motor vehicle
upon any public roads and highways is guilty of driving under a twelve-point

been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual
inspection of a motor vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not
be used for the purpose of determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or

necessary to carry out this section.
   (g)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a
child restraint system, a booster seat or an occupant restraining device as
required by this section is not negligence imputable to the child, is not
admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to

occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).
      (2)   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.

jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is

501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is

aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio

imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 Type of Misdemeanor                         Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00

the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed

subsection, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal
setting by a person who, by education or experience, is competent to provide
those services.

any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.

vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the

   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially

      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

purpose;

activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
 
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,

 545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
 545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
 545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
 545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
 545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

R.C. 4503.22, a temporary motor vehicle license registration as prescribed by
Ohio R.C. 4503.182, or any comparable temporary motor vehicle license

is convenient, review the site of the proposed improvement, and issue the
property owning applicant(s) an estimated maximum assessment of material costs
and an estimated cost of labor. The notification should state the following
rules and regulations of the program:
         A.   The property owner shall pay the assessment of material costs
either forthwith or within thirty day of the completion of the improvement.
         B.   The Village shall cover the estimated cost of labor, provided the
property owner pays the material cost assessment within the completion plus the
thirty day stipulated time frame above.
         C.   Failure to pay the material cost assessment within the completion
plus the thirty day stipulated time frame will cause the entire improvement
cost (material and labor) to be certified over to the Preble County Auditor and
Treasurer to be collected on the tax duplicate, with a twenty percent (20%)
penalty added thereon.
         D.   The Village will complete the improvement as soon as it is
practicable for its labor force, and on a priority list of applicant(s) in
order of their application dates.
         E.   The Village is in no way warranting or guaranteeing the quality
of its performance in the improvement project.
      (3)   When the applicant(s) have reviewed the proposed improvement and
assessment, the applicant(s) shall all sign a form prescribed by the Service
Department Supervisor agreeing to pay the maximum assessment of material costs
forthwith or within thirty days of the completion of the improvement. The form
should further specify that failure to so pay shall cause all costs of the
improvement (material and labor), to be certified to the County tax duplicate
for collection, with a twenty percent (20%) penalty added thereon.
      (4)   When each and every applicant to an improvement for sidewalks,
curbs, and/or gutters has signed the necessary forms agreeing to the voluntary
assessment mentioned above, the Service Department Supervisor shall file the
forms with the Village Clerk. The forms will be brought before Council at the
earliest convenient time, and upon Council's approval of the improvement
project, the improvement shall be made under the supervision of the Service
Department Supervisor.
      (5)   Upon completion of the improvement, the Service Department
Supervisor shall advise all property owners assessed for the improvement the
amount of their assessment, in writing, and the deadline date for payment of
the assessment at the Town Hall Village Offices. This notification can be by
certified mail, regular mail, personal or hand delivery, and/or tacking on the
property owner's building.
   (d)   The Mayor is authorized to prescribe any other rules and regulations
necessary to carry out the terms and intent of this program. Any rules and
regulations so prescribed shall be filed with the Village Clerk and a copy
given to the Service Department Supervisor and each Council member.

   No person shall make any opening in, cut into, break, bore, tunnel under or
otherwise disturb any street, alley, sidewalk, curb, gutter or public right of
way of the Village without first obtaining a permit therefor for each separate
undertaking. However, any person maintaining pipes, lines or other underground
facilities in or under the surface of any street may proceed with an opening
without a permit when emergency circumstances demand that the work be done
immediately and when the permit cannot reasonably and practically be obtained
beforehand, provided that a diligent effort has been made to contact the

on the first regular working day of the Director and such a permit shall be
retroactive to the date when the work began.
(Ord. 2020-10. Passed 9-3-20.)
903.03 WORK LIMITATIONS.
   No person to whom a permit has been granted shall perform any of the work
authorized by such permit in any amount or quantity greater than that specified
in the permit, except that upon the approval of the Director additional work

903.04 TIME FOR COMMENCEMENT OF WORK.
   Work for which a permit has been issued shall commence within ten (10) days
after the issuance of the permit therefor. If not so commenced, the permit
shall be automatically terminated. Permits thus terminated may be renewed only
upon the payment of an additional permit fee in a like amount as that
originally required.
(Ord. 2020-10. Passed 9-3-20.)

not be applicable unless otherwise stipulated in the contract.
(Ord. 2020-10. Passed 9-3-20.)
903.08  ALTERNATE RESTORATION PROCEDURE.
   At the time of the issuance of the permit, the Director shall specify
whether the Village or the permittee shall have the responsibility for
restoring the street damaged by the opening work. This decision shall determine
the duties and responsibilities of the permittee as provided further in this
chapter. (Ord. 2020-10. Passed 9-3-20.)
903.09  PERMIT LIMITATIONS; RIGHTS OF VILLAGE.
   Every permit shall be granted subject to the right of the Village or of any
other person entitled to use the street for any purpose for which such street
may lawfully be used, not inconsistent with the permit.
(Ord. 2020-10. Passed 9-3-20.)
903.10 REVOCATION OF PERMITS; NOTICE; REMEDY OF VILLAGE.

903.13 EXCAVATING PROCEDURE AND CONDITIONS.
   (a)   Excavations shall be classified as either Class I or Class II
openings. A Class I opening is an opening of fifty (50) square feet or less. A
Class II opening is any opening or excavation of more than fifty (50) square
feet.

centerline of the street before being backfilled and the surface of the street
temporarily restored.
   (c)   Not more than 250 feet, measured longitudinally, shall be opened in
any street at any one time.
   (d)   All Village-owned facilities, such as sewers, water lines or other
structures, that are encountered during the construction, shall be carefully
protected, at the expense of the permit holder, to prevent damage. In the event
of damage to such facilities or structures, any costs incurred by the Village
for repairs shall be deducted from the permit holder's deposit. If it is
necessary to relocate, remove or replace any such facility or structure, the
work shall be done at the expense of the permit holder in accordance with
specific plans and specifications presented by the permittee and approved by
the Director or his agent.
   (e)   Pipe drains, pipe culverts and other facilities encountered shall be
protected by the permittee.
   (f)   Any person whose facilities are damaged by the permittee may make the
necessary repairs and file a claim against the permittee with the Village for
the cost of such repairs. This amount may be held by the Director from the
deposit pending determination of liability for the damage.
   (g)   Monuments of concrete, iron or other lasting material set for the
purpose of locating or preserving the lines of any street or property
subdivision, or a precise survey reference point or a permanent survey bench
mark within the Village, shall not be removed or disturbed or caused to be
removed or disturbed unless permission to do so is first obtained in writing
from the Director. Permission shall be granted only upon condition that the
permittee shall pay all expenses incident to the proper replacement of the
monument. Any such replacement must be accomplished by a State-licensed
professional land surveyor.
   (h)   When work performed by the permittee interferes with the established
drainage system of any street, provision shall be made by the permittee to
provide proper drainage to the satisfaction of the Director.
   (i)   When any earth, gravel or other excavated material is caused to roll,
flow or wash upon any street, the permittee shall cause the same to be removed
from the street within four (4) hours after deposit. In the event the earth,
gravel or other excavated material so deposited is not removed, the Director
shall cause such removal and the cost incurred shall be paid by the permittee
or deducted from his deposit.

barricades, lights, warning flags and danger signs as shall be determined by
the Director to be necessary for the protection of the public.
   Whenever any person fails to provide or maintain the safety devices required
by the Director, such devices shall be installed and maintained by the Village.
The amount of the cost incurred shall be paid by the permittee or deducted from
his deposit.
   No person shall willfully move, remove, injure, destroy or extinguish any
barrier, warning light, sign or notice erected, placed or posted in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter.
    Every person who applies for and obtains a street opening permit from the
Village shall be responsible for maintaining traffic control in accordance with
the Ohio Uniform Traffic Control Manual. This includes the placement of signs,
flagmen, if necessary, and all advance warning devices and barricades.
   (k)   Access to private driveways shall be provided except during working
hours when construction operations prohibit provision of such access. Free
access must be provided at all times to fire hydrants.
   (l)   Excavated materials shall be laid compactly along the side of the
trench and kept trimmed up so as to cause as little inconvenience as possible
to public travel. In order to expedite the flow of traffic or to abate a dirt
or dust nuisance, the Director may require the permittee to provide toe boards
or bins; and if the excavated area is muddy and causes inconvenience to
pedestrians, temporary wooden plank walks shall be installed by the permittee
as directed by the Director. If the street is not wide enough to hold the
excavated material without using part of the adjacent sidewalk, the permittee
shall keep a passageway at least one-half the sidewalk width open along such
sidewalk line.
   (m)   Work authorized by a permit shall be performed between the hours of 7:
00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, unless the permittee obtains
written consent from the Director to do the work at an earlier or later hour.
Such permission shall be granted only in case of an emergency.
   (n)   In granting any permit, the Director may attach such other conditions
thereto as may be reasonably necessary to prevent damage to public or private
property or to prevent the operation from being conducted in a manner hazardous
to life or property or in a manner likely to create a nuisance. Such conditions
may include but shall not be limited to:
      (1)   Limitations on the period of the year in which the work may be
performed;
      (2)   Restrictions as to the size and type of equipment;
      (3)   Designation of routes upon which materials may be transported;
      (4)   The place and manner of disposal of excavated materials;

prevention of noise and other results offensive or injurious to the
neighborhood, the general public or any portion thereof; and
      (6)   Regulations as to the use of streets in the course of the work.
         (Ord. 2020-10. Passed 9-3-20.)

backfilled and temporarily surfaced by the permittee according to Village
specifications.
   (b)   The Director must be notified by the permittee at least four (4) hours
preceding the beginning of backfilling, of the date and approximate time at
which backfilling will be begun.
   (c)   No backfilling shall be accomplished unless or until the Director or
his representative is present.
   (d)   The work of restoration, including both paving and base shall be
performed directly by the Village under the supervision of the Director.
   Or Alternate Provision To Subsection (d) Where Municipality Does Not Restore
The Opening
   (d)   The work of restoration, including both paving surface and paving
base, shall be performed by the permittee according to Village specifications.
 
   (e)   If the Director finds that surface pavement adjacent to the street
opening may be damaged where trenches are made parallel to the street, or where
a number of cross trenches are laid in close proximity to one another, or where
the equipment used may cause such damage, he may require a negotiated
contribution from the permittee for the resurfacing, in place of patching, of
such street if the total area of the proposed patch or probably damaged area
exceeds fifteen percent (15%) of the total surface pavement between curb faces
or between concrete gutter edges in any block. Such negotiations shall be
carried on and contributions agreed upon prior to issuance of a permit.
   (f)   After excavation is commenced, the work of making and backfilling the
same shall be prosecuted with due diligence.
   (g)   The Director shall make daily inspections of all work authorized by a
permit. The Director is hereby empowered to provide a full-time inspector if
the work to be performed is of a nature that a full-time inspector is necessary
to ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (h)   All inspection costs shall be borne by the permittee. Such costs shall
be based on a schedule of charges on file in the office of the Director.
   (i)   Upon completion of all work accomplished under the provisions of the
permit, the permittee shall notify the Director in writing. A certificate of
final inspection shall be issued by the Director to each permittee no sooner
than one (1) year after the permanent restoration of the excavation has been
made, provided the work authorized by the permit has been performed according
to Village specifications. Prior to the issuance of a certificate, the Director
shall make a final inspection of the restoration to determine whether Village
specifications have been adhered to.
   (j)   If any settlement in a restored area occurs within a period of one (1)
year from the date of completion of the permanent restoration, any expense
incurred by the Village in correcting such settlement shall be paid by the
permittee or recovered from his bond, unless the permittee submits proof
satisfactory to the Director that the settlement was not due to defective
backfilling.
   (k)   In no case shall any opening made by a permittee be considered in the
charge or care of the Village, or any of its officers or employees, and no
officer or employee is authorized in any way to take or assume any jurisdiction
over any such opening, except in the exercise of the police power, when it is
necessary to protect life and property.
(Ord. 2020-10. Passed 9-3-20.)
903.15  AMOUNT OF DEPOSIT; USES.
   (a)   The Director, upon receipt of a properly completed application, shall
determine the amount of the deposit to be made by the permittee. However, the
deposit shall not be less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for a Class I
opening nor less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for a Class II opening.
The deposit shall be paid at the time the permit is received, and it shall be
used to reimburse the Village for the cost of any work and materials furnished
by it in connection with the work authorized by the permit, to cover all
necessary inspections of such work and for any other purpose set forth in this
chapter.
   (b)   In addition to any cash deposit and permit fees required for a Class I
or Class II street opening permit, the following payments shall be made to the
Village. This schedule applies to any street opening which disturbs pavement,
concrete, gutters, sidewalks, etc., on any street which has been improved,
resurfaced, constructed or reconstructed within the previous ten (10) years.
    The Director will determine the payment to be made prior to issuing the
permit. A list of streets and the year they were improved will be maintained by
the Director.

Example:                                 Example:
Excavation 8' x 12' made in a 5 year old Excavation 3' x 100' in a 3 year old
street:                                  street:
$600.00 for first 20 sq. ft. excavation; $8,000 for first 200 sq. ft. of
96 sq. ft. - 20 sq. ft. = 76 sq. ft. x   excavation;
$30 sq. ft. =                            300 sq. ft. - 200 sq. ft.= 100 sq. ft.
$2,280;                                  x $13.00 =
$2,280 + $600 = $2,880 Total Payment     $1,300;
                                         $8,000 + $1,300 = $9,300
      (1)   Individual sanitary sewer laterals shall be exempt from the payment
schedule. Connections to natural gas and water or sewer mains to serve new
buildings shall also be exempt from the payment schedule. The provision of
services to vacant parcels shall be planned for prior to a street improvement
and, where practical, shall be installed in advance so as to prevent disturbing
the new street during the ten (10) year period following the completion of
improvements.
      (2)   The Village may waive the street opening payment in the case of an
opening required as the result of a natural disaster, such as, but not limited
to, a flood, earthquake or tornado. The Director may also waive charges as
required under the payment schedule if it is determined that the need to open
an improved street during the ten (10) year period is due to circumstances
beyond the control of the permittee involved or is the result of unusual
conditions that could not have been foreseen.

   (e)   The owner(s) of all houses, buildings, or properties used for human
occupancy, employment, recreation, or other purposes, situated within the
Village and abutting on any street, alley, or right of way in which there is
now located or may in the future be located a public sanitary sewer of the
Village, is hereby required at the owner's expense to install suitable toilet
facilities therein, and to connect such facilities directly to the proper
public sewer in accordance with this chapter.
 
   (f)   No person, firm, or corporation shall be permitted to connect to or

(Ord. 1986-7. Passed 3-18-86.)
925.04 WASTEWATER MONITORING AND INSPECTION.
   (a)   All industrial users who discharge or propose to discharge wastewaters
to the wastewater treatment system shall maintain such records of production
and related factors, effluent flows, and pollutant amounts and concentrations
of such pollutants that are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the
requirements of this chapter and any applicable State or Federal pretreatment
standards or requirements.
 
   (b)   Such records shall be made available upon request by the Village. All
such records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made
available to officials of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA)
upon demand.
 
   (c)   If so ordered by the Village, the owner or operator of any premises or
facility discharging industrial wastes into the system shall install at his own
cost and expense a control manhole and suitable monitoring equipment to
facilitate the accurate observation, sampling, and measurement of wastes. Such
facilities shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and
accessible at all times.
 
   (d)   The control manhole and monitoring equipment shall be located and
maintained on the industrial user's premises outside of the building. When such
a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the
Village may allow such a facility to be constructed in the public right of way,
with the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction of such right of
way, and located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities,
landscaping, or parked vehicles.
 
   (e)   When more than one user can discharge into a common sewer, the Village
may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each user. When
there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and
characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the Village
may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each
discharge.
 
   (f)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the Village requirements and
all applicable construction standards and specifications.
 
   (g)   Compliance determinations with respect to the prohibitions and
limitations stated in Section
925.02 may be made on the basis of either instantaneous grab samples or
composite samples of wastewater. Composite samples may be taken over a twenty-
four hour period, or over a longer or shorter time span, as determined
necessary by the Village in order to meet the needs of specific circumstances.
 
   (h)   Laboratory analysis of industrial wastewater samples shall be
performed in accordance with the current edition of "Standard Methods",
"Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Waste", published by the U.S. EPA,
or the "Annual Book of Standards, Part 23, Water, Atmospheric Analysis",
published by the American Society for Testing and Materials. Analysis of those
pollutants not covered by these publications shall be performed in accordance
with procedures established by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA). In addition, all measurements, tests, and analysis of the characteristics
of wastewater shall also be made in conformance with the Federal Register (40
CFR Part 136) entitled "Guidelines for Establishing Test Procedures for the
Analysis of Pollutants".
 
   (i)   Sampling of industrial wastewater for the purpose of compliance
determination, with respect to the prohibitions and limitations stated in
Section
925.02, will be done at such intervals as designated by the Village.
 
   (j)   Duly authorized employees of the Village bearing proper credentials
and identifications shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purposes
of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, and testing pertinent to
discharge to the community system in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
 
   (k)   Duly authorized Village employees are authorized to obtain information
concerning industrial processes which have a direct bearing on the kind and
source of discharge to the wastewater collection system. The industry may
withhold information considered confidential provided that the industry
establishes that revealing such information to the public might result in an
advantage to competitors.
 
   (l)   While performing necessary work for private properties, referred to in
subsection (j) hereof, the Village or duly authorized employees of the Village
shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises.
(Ord. 1986-7. Passed 3-18-86.)
925.05 PROTECTION FROM ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE.
   (a)   Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this chapter.
Facilities to prevent accidental discharge or prohibited materials shall be
provided and maintained at the owner's or operator's own cost and expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the Village for review, and shall be approved
by the Village before construction of the facility. Review and approval of such
plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify his facility as necessary to meet the requirements of
this chapter.
 
   (b)   If, for any reason, a facility does not comply with or will be unable
to comply with any prohibition or limitations in this chapter, the facility
responsible for such discharge shall immediately notify the Village so that
corrective action may be taken to protect the treatment system. In addition, a
written report addressed to the Village detailing the date, time, and cause of
the accidental discharge; the quantity and characteristics of the discharge;
and corrective action taken to prevent future discharges, shall be filed by the
responsible industrial facility within five days of the occurrence of the
noncomplying discharge.
(Ord. 1986-7. Passed 3-18-86.)
925.06 VIOLATIONS, PENALTIES, AND RIGHT OF APPEAL.
   (a)   Whenever the Village finds that any person has violated or is
violating any prohibition, limitation, or provision of this chapter, they may
serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the violation and
providing a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty days for a satisfactory
correction thereof. Such notice shall also state that any person in violation
of this chapter shall be liable for any resulting damages or applicable fines.
 
   (b)   If the violation is not corrected by timely compliance, the Village
may order any person who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge to show
cause before the Village why service should not be terminated. A notice shall
be served on the offending party, specifying the time and place of a hearing to
be held to show cause before the Village why an order should not be made
directing the termination of service. The notice of the hearing shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at
least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer
of a corporation.
   (c)   Council may itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or may
designate any of its members or any officer or employee of the Village to:
      (1)   Issue in the name of the Village notices of hearings requesting the
attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant
to any matter involved in any such hearings.
      (2)   Take the evidence.
      (3)   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the Village
for action thereon.

person designated by it, must be under oath and recorded stenographically. The
transcript, so recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or
any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges therefore.
 
   (e)   After the Village has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to
the party responsible for the discharge directing that following a specified
time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances shall have been installed
or existing treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are
properly operated, and such further orders and directives are as necessary and
appropriate.
 
   (f)   Any discharge in violation of the substantive provisions of this
chapter or an Order of the Village shall be considered a public nuisance. If
any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into the
Village treatment system contrary to the substantive provisions of this
chapter, or any Order of the Village, the Village shall commence an action for
appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in Court.
 
   (g)   Any person who is found to have violated an Order of the Village, or
has willfully or negligently failed to comply with any provision of this
chapter, and the orders, rules, and regulations issued hereunder, shall be
fined not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more than one hundred dollars
($100.00) for each offense. Each day on which a violation shall occur or
continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense. In addition to the
penalties provided herein, the Village may recover reasonable attorneys' fees,
court costs, court reporters' fees, and other expenses of litigation by
appropriate suit at law against the person found to have violated this
Ordinance or the orders, rules, and regulations issued hereunder.
(Ord. 1986-7. Passed 3-18-86.)
925.07 STORMWATER CONTROL ON FUTURE LAND DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   Future land developments in the Village shall have stormwater systems,
including runoff storage detention and/or retention facilities as necessary,
designed in accordance with the following criteria:
      (1)   The post-development peak rate of runoff from a storm of ten year
frequency (of 24 hours duration) and all more frequent storms occurring on the
site development area under consideration shall be controlled, prior to its
release to its off-site outlet, so as not to exceed the peak rate of runoff
from a one year frequency storm (of 24 hours duration) occurring on the same
area under predevelopment conditions.
      (2)   The post-development peak rate of runoff from storms of less
frequent occurrence than the ten year storm, up to the 100 year storm, shall be
controlled, prior to its release to its off-site outlet, so as not to exceed
the peak rates of runoff from equivalent size storms under predevelopment
conditions.
   (b)   The review and approval by the Village of design calculations for the
stormwater system shall be required as a part of approval of the overall
development proposal. Such approval process shall be done by the Planning
Commission and/or, where appropriate, by the Zoning Inspector and/or Zoning
Board.
 
   (c)   The Village may require land developers to grant the Village
appropriate easements for access and maintenance purposes as a part of the
approval process. Further, the Village may require land developers to allow the
Village the ability to maintain the stormwater systems during the post-
development period.

future bills until the first bill following the date the status change is
reported.
   (d)   Status changes that would result in a delinquent account or higher
future bills must be reported by the last day of the month of the status change
to be considered timely. The Village Clerk or his authorized agent shall
appropriately reflect the increase and adjustments on the next bill to the
“billable account”.
   (e)   To help insure the proper accounting of status changes, the Village
Clerk or his authorized agent shall require a shutoff of water services from
the “billable account’s” requested vacancy date until the “billable account’s”
requested reoccupancy date (no turn on fee will be assessed at the reoccupancy
date). (Ord. 1996-12. Passed 9-23-96.)

1105.01 PRELIMINARY PLAT PROCEDURE: MAJOR SUBDIVISION.
   (a)   Approval Required.  No person, firm or corporation, proposing to make
or have made a subdivision within the territorial jurisdiction of these
Regulations shall enter into any contract for the sale of, or shall offer to
sell any subdivision or any part thereof, or shall proceed with any
construction work on such proposed subdivision, including grading, until he or
it has obtained from the Planning Commission tentative approval of the
preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision.
   (b)   Nonresidential Development.  In order to assure and coordinate the
orderly development of land not covered elsewhere within these Regulations,
including but not limited to land zoned for industrial, commercial, business or
multi-family usage by providing, at the time of development, for those
facilities necessary for the public health and welfare of the community, no
person, firm or corporation proposing such development comprising one or more
parcels within the territorial jurisdiction of these Regulations, shall apply
for, receive or cause to be issued a certificate of zoning compliance or a
building permit until he or it has filed with the County Recorder an approved
plat of such land in accordance with these Regulations. The subdivision of such
land shall extend to the center line of all contiguous rights of way.
   If, however, such development shall not involve any new street, curb cuts
and easements, or does not create additional building sites and meets all
requirements for the proper development in accordance with all existing plans
adopted by the Planning Commission and is in the best interests of the
community's health and welfare, the Planning Commission, by vote of a two-
thirds majority, may waive the requirement for such plat. If such requirement
for a plat is waived, a letter stating same shall be provided to the owner and/
or developer by the Planning Commission and shall be so stated in its records.
The issuance of such letter shall satisfy all requirements intended within
these Regulations.
   Before preparing and submitting the preliminary plat to the Planning
Commission, it is suggested that the subdivider or his engineer consult with
the Planning Officer while the plat is in sketch form, to ascertain the
location of proposed highways, primary or secondary thoroughfares, parkways,
parks, playgrounds and other planned developments.
   (c)   Submittal. The subdivider shall submit a written request to the
Planning Commission for preliminary plat approval. This request shall be
submitted at least ten days prior to the regular monthly meeting of the
Planning Commission at which consideration of the plat is desired and shall be
accompanied by the following graphic material and written data:
      (1)   One key map to adequately locate the property to be subdivided and
its relationship to surrounding areas.
      (2)   Ten copies of the preliminary plat in accordance with the
specifications and requirements of Section
1107.01.
   (d)   Review. Upon the receipt of the application for preliminary plat
approval, the Planning Commission shall check the graphic and written data for
completeness and conformance to these Regulations and the Major Street Plan and
other applicable sections of the Comprehensive Plan. If complete, the plat
shall be accepted for processing and the Planning Commission shall distribute
two copies of the plat to the Village Engineer, two copies to the
Superintendent of Schools, two copies to the Parks Department and one copy to
each of the local utility companies.
   The Village Engineer shall examine and check the plat for general
engineering and conformance to required public improvements. The Superintendent
of Schools shall be consulted regarding the potential effects of the proposed
subdivision upon the school system and whether or not there is need for new
school sites within or in the vicinity of the proposed plat. The various
utility companies shall indicate the availability or non-availability of
utilities and the suitability of any proposed utility easements. All agencies
contacted shall, within seven days of receipt of the preliminary plat, be
requested to return one print of such plat to the Planning Commission with
their approval, comments or recommended changes noted thereon.
   (e)   Approval. The Planning Commission shall approve, modify or disapprove
the preliminary plat within thirty days from the date of the regular meeting at
which the plat was presented, provided that a further period of time may ensue
if the applicant consents to such an extension of time. Approval of the
preliminary plat by the Planning Commission shall always be subject to the
following conditions and modifications:
      (1)   A recommendation from the Village Engineer concerning the adequacy
or inadequacy of the proposed street improvements, water and sewer systems, or
any other public improvements proposed by the subdivider.
      (2)   The approval of the Planning Commission shall be noted on two
copies of the preliminary plat along with any modifications or conditions of
approval. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider and the other retained
by the Commission.
      (3)   Approval shall be effective for a maximum period of twelve months
unless, upon application of the subdivider, the Planning Commission grants an
extension. If the final plat has not been officially submitted for processing
within this limit, the subdivider must re-submit the proposed subdivision and
proceed through the preliminary plat stages in accordance with these
Regulations.
      (4)   Approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning Commission is an
expression of approval of the general street and lot layout, the proposed
improvements to be provided, and is subject to any conditions or modifications
placed upon the plat by the Commission. Preliminary plat approval does not
guarantee approval of the final plat nor does it constitute any public
acceptance of streets, alleys or other public ways or open spaces.
   (f)   Disapproval.
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall disapprove the drawing if it is not
in accordance with the provisions of these Regulations or if the proposed
improvements are not approved by the appropriate public agencies.
      (2)   If the Planning Commission disapproves the preliminary plat, the
Commission shall so advise the subdivider in writing and note the reasons for
such disapproval in its meeting minutes.
         (Ord. 1972-20. Passed 12-19-72.)
1105.02 FINAL PLAT PROCEDURE: MAJOR SUBDIVISION.
   The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as
approved by the Planning Commission. If desired by the subdivider, the final
plat may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which he
proposes to record and develop at the time. The final plat shall conform to the
requirements of Section
1107.02.
   (a)   Submittal.  The subdivider shall submit a written application for
approval of the plat along with a reproducible copy and five black line or blue
line print copies of the final plat and two copies of the final construction
plans to the Planning Commission. All protective covenants, deed restrictions,
reservations, grants and easements should accompany the final plat in a form
suitable for recording. Such application shall be submitted not less than ten
days prior to the regular monthly meeting of the Planning Commission at which
the application is to be considered.
   (b)   Review. Prior to consideration of the final plat application by the
Planning Commission, the Village Engineer shall review the plat and the
accompanying construction plans to determine its conformance to engineering
specifications and improvement plans proposed in the preliminary plat. The
Planning Commission shall also review the final plat application and determine
its conformance or nonconformance with the lot layout, street design and other
proposals contained in the approved preliminary plat. The Village Engineer
shall certify his approval or disapproval of the plat in writing to the
Planning Commission for their consideration.
   (c)   Approval.  The Planning Commission shall review the final plat and
approve or disapprove the plat within thirty days from the date of the regular
meeting at which the plat is presented for their review.
      (1)   Prior to approval, the Planning Commission shall ascertain that
satisfactory arrangements have been made by the subdivider as outlined in
Sections
1111.01 and
1111.02, to provide for financing and inspection of required public
improvements.
      (2)   If approved, the Planning Commission shall indicate such approval
on the final plat by the signatures of its chairman and secretary.
      (3)   Approval of the final plat by the Planning Commission shall not
indicate public acceptance of any lands, rights of way or easements shown on
the plat.
      (4)   The Planning Commission shall then transmit the reproducible copy
and four prints of the final plat along with certificate of title to Council,
for such action as may be necessary on any proposed dedication. Thereupon,
Council shall transmit the reproducible copy and three approved prints thereof
to the Planning Commission for the subdivider and the Village Engineer.
      (5)   If the Planning Commission disapproves the final plat, it shall
forward a written report to the subdivider stating the reasons for such
disapproval.
         (Ord. 1972-20. Passed 12-19-72.)
1105.03 PRELIMINARY PLAT PROCEDURE: MINOR SUBDIVISION.
   (a)   Jurisdiction. After the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, no
lot or parcel of land divided or split into five or less lots or parcels and
lying within boundaries of the Official Major Street Plan of the Municipality,
as adopted or amended, may be recorded by the County Recorder until or unless
the deed recording such lot split or subdivision shall have affixed or
imprinted thereon a statement of approval signed by the chairman and the
secretary of the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Procedure. The owner or his designated agent shall submit a written
request to the Planning Commission for a minor subdivision preliminary plat
approval. This request shall be submitted at least ten days prior to the
regular monthly meeting of the Planning Commission at which consideration of
the plat is desired and shall be accompanied by a sketch plan of the proposed
lot split or minor subdivision. The drawing may be a simple pencil sketch drawn
to scale showing the existing and proposed layout of lots and containing enough
information so that an accurate analysis can be made as to conformance or
nonconformance with these or other regulations adopted by the Municipality.
   (c)   Planning Commission Approval.  Upon receipt of the request and
accompanying sketch plan, the Planning Commission shall ascertain whether the
proposed minor subdivision is or is not in conformance with these regulations,
the Zoning Ordinance and the Comprehensive Plan of the Municipality. At its
next regular meeting (following ten days or more after receipt of the above-
mentioned request) the Planning Commission shall either approve or disapprove
the proposal and shall notify the applicant of its decision in writing. If
disapproved, the Commission shall state the reasons for such disapproval. If
approved, the chairman and secretary of the Planning Commission shall thereby
be authorized to place an official stamp of approval on such deeds of
conveyance that the applicant may submit that conform to such preliminary plat.
One clear copy of any such deed shall be submitted to the Municipal Clerk.
(Ord. 1972-20. Passed 12-19-72.)
1105.04 RECORDING.
   After the final plat has been approved by the Planning Commission and
dedications accepted by Council and the necessary approvals endorsed in writing
thereon, the subdivider shall file a copy of the plat for recording in the
office of the County Recorder within sixty days after the date of final
approval and furnish the Municipality with the original cloth tracing and four
prints of the final recorded plat.

subdivision development due to flooding, poor drainage, soil conditions or
other features which are likely to be harmful to the health, safety and welfare
of future residents shall not be subdivided unless satisfactory methods of
correction are formulated by the subdivider and approved by the Planning
Commission.
   (c)   The Planning Commission shall consider plats designed for special
development of group housing, new concepts of solar orientation, superblock
arrangements or other methods of site design which may require modification or
adjustment of these Regulations, providing that such plats do not have an
unfavorable effect upon the development of adjacent properties.
   (d)   Variations, exceptions and/or modifications of these design
requirements may be made by the Planning Commission in specific cases where it
is deemed that hardship, unusual topographical conditions or other unique
conditions justify such variance.

   (a)   Prior to submission of the final plat for approval two complete sets
of preliminary construction plans, showing contemplated improvements for the
required streets, utilities and other facilities required by these Regulations,
shall be on file with the Village Engineer. Before approving or disapproving
the final plat, the Planning Commission shall require a written statement from
the Village Engineer and the parks official regarding the adequacy or
inadequacy of construction plans and improvements as proposed by the
subdivider.
   (b)   Inspection. Before approving a final plat and the accompanying
construction plans for public improvements, the Planning Commission shall
require satisfactory evidence that agreement has been reached between the
subdivider and the Village Engineer in providing for the inspection of the
various public improvements as they are constructed.
(Ord. 1972-20. Passed 12-19-72.)
1111.02 IMPROVEMENT GUARANTEES.
   In lieu of the actual installation of required public improvements, the
subdivider shall provide a financial guarantee of performance in one or a
combination of the following arrangements subject to the review of Council.
   (a)   Performance Bond. A performance or surety bond to cover the cost of
the contemplated improvements as certified by the Village Engineer and parks
official shall be filed with the Village Clerk. Such bond shall specify the
time period in which the improvements are to be completed and shall be with an
acceptable bonding company authorized to do business in Ohio by the Secretary

to cover the cost of the contemplated improvements as certified by the Village
Engineer and parks official shall be deposited with the Municipal Clerk. The
escrow deposit shall be for the estimated time period necessary to complete the
required public improvements.
      In the case of either cash deposits or certified checks, an agreement
between Council and the subdivider may provide for progressive payments out of
the cash deposit or reduction of the certified check or surety bond to the
extent of the estimated cost of the completed portion of the public
improvements as certified by the Village Engineer.
      (Ord. 1972-20. Passed 12-19-72.)
1111.03 PENALTY FOR NONCOMPLETION OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   In case the subdivider fails to complete the required public improvement
work within such time period as required by the conditions of the guarantee as
outlined herein, the Municipality shall proceed to have such work completed and
reimburse itself for the cost thereof by appropriating the cash deposit,
certified check or surety bond or shall take the necessary steps to require
performance by the bonding company.
(Ord. 1972-20. Passed 12-19-72.)
1111.04 REQUIRED PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   Every subdivision shall be required to provide complete public utilities
including water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer and full street improvements
including street paving, curb and gutter, street trees and sidewalks.
   The minimum standards for required public improvements shall be as follows:
   (a)   Water. A public water system containing eight-inch minimum supply
line, fire hydrants, valves and other water system appurtenances shall be
constructed in conformance with the requirements of the Village Engineer unless
reduced by the Village Engineer.

appurtenances of the system shall be constructed in conformance with the
requirements of the Village Engineer.

Engineer.
      (1)   All natural water drainage ways shall be preserved at their natural
gradient unless otherwise determined by the Planning Commission upon
recommendation from the Village Engineer.

drain therefrom.
   (d)   Street. Full street improvements including adequate subgrade
preparation, hard surfacing, curb and gutter shall be required in every
subdivision in conformance with the construction standards of the Village
Engineer. The minimum standards for such street improvement shall be as
follows:
      (1)   Street surfacing. The finished roadway surfacing shall be either
asphaltic or bituminous aggregate concrete, or Portland cement concrete
installed in conformance with the specifications of the Village Engineer.
      (2)   Street surfacing width. Minimum street surfacing widths shall be as
follows:
 
 
Minor streets     33 feet *(to face of curb)
Neighborhood      38 feet (to face of curb)
Collector streets
Major streets     52 feet (to face of curb)
*In cases of cul-de-sac and loop street developments, the minor street paving
width may be lowered to twenty-four feet where, in the judgment of the Planning
Commission, this width will be sufficient to accommodate the anticipated
traffic volumes of the overall neighborhood. Added street pavement width may be
required by the Planning Commission for minor streets and collector streets
which are designed to serve high-density residential developments, and
commercial or industrial subdivisions.
      (3)   Curb and gutter. Curb and gutter of a type approved by the Village
Engineer shall be provided for all minor, neighborhood collector and major
streets within each subdivision.
      (4)   Street islands and boulevards. Where the subdivider proposes
boulevard streets and/or street islands in his street layout, the subdivider
shall make suitable plans for landscaping the boulevard or island areas. All
such landscaping plans shall be approved as to height, size and type of plant
material by the Municipal staff.
   (e)   Sidewalks and Crosswalks. Each subdivision shall provide concrete
sidewalks five feet in width on both sides of the street in accordance with the
Village Engineer's specifications. The Planning Commission may change the
requirement where, in their judgment, such improvement will adequately serve
the pedestrian needs of the subdivision. In subdivisions containing lots of 150
feet width or more, the Planning Commission may reduce this requirement to one
sidewalk where, in their judgment such improvement will adequately serve the
pedestrian needs of the subdivision and the surrounding neighborhood.
Crosswalkways, where required, shall have a five foot paving width centered
within the required ten-foot public right of way.
   (f)   Alleys. Alleys, where permitted, shall be paved in concrete or other
bituminous material to their full right-of-way width under specifications
approved by the Village Engineer.
   (g)   Street Trees. Street trees shall be required in each subdivision of a
type, size and location as specified by the staff of the Municipality.

standard name signs at each intersection.
   (k)   Utilities. All utilities shall be installed underground.
      (Ord. 1972-20. Passed 12-19-72.)
1111.05 OPTIONAL PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   Landscape planting, louvered fences for screening or other suitable
landscape treatment may be made by the subdivider within required greenbelts,
buffer parks or other open spaces where he desires to protect his development
from the detrimental effects of adjacent expressways, major streets, railroads
or other land uses. Such landscape plans should be indicated on the
subdivider's improvement plans and shall be approved by the Planning Commission
after review by the Municipal staff.
(Ord. 1972-20. Passed 12-19-72.)
1111.06 VARIANCES.
   Where the Planning Commission finds that strict compliance with these
minimum improvement requirements result in extraordinary hardship or
unreasonable costs being imposed upon a particular subdivision, it may vary
these improvement regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the
public interest secured.
   In granting variances and modifications of these Regulations, the Planning
Commission may require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure the
objectives of the standards of requirements so varied or modified.

seeking:
      (1)   To encourage and facilitate orderly, efficient and appropriate

intent that, if any provisions of this Ordinance, or the application thereof to
any zoning lot, building or other structure, or tract of land, are declared by
a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or ineffective in whole or in
part, or to be inapplicable to any person or situation, the effect of such
decision shall be limited to the provision or provisions which are expressly
stated in the sections to be invalid or ineffective to the zoning lot, building
or other structure, or tract of land immediately involved in the controversy.
All other provisions of this Zoning Ordinance shall continue to be separate and
fully effective, and the application of any such provision to other persons or
situations shall not be affected.
   (c)   Repeal of Conflicting Ordinance. All ordinances or parts of ordinances
in conflict with this Zoning Ordinance or inconsistent with the provisions of
this Ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent necessary to give this

conforms to the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.

1123.01 GENERAL.
   Appeals and variances shall conform to the procedures and requirements of
Sections
1123.02 to
1123.09, inclusive of this Zoning Ordinance. As specified in Section
1125.07, the Board of Zoning Appeals has appellate jurisdiction relative to
appeals and variances.
(Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)
1123.02 APPEALS.
   Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals concerning interpretation or
administration of the Zoning Ordinance may be taken by any person aggrieved or
by any officer of the legislative authority of the Village affected by any
decision of the Zoning Inspector. Such appeal shall be taken within twenty days
after the decision by filing, with the Zoning Inspector and with the Board of
Zoning Appeals, a notice of appeal specifying the grounds upon which the appeal
is being taken. The Zoning Inspector shall transmit to the Board of Zoning
Appeals all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed
from was taken.
(Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)
1123.03 STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from,
unless the Zoning Inspector from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the
Board of Zoning Appeals after the notice of appeal is filed with him, that by
reason of facts stated in the application, a stay would, in his opinion, cause
imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be
stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board of
Zoning Appeals or by a court or record on application, on notice to the Zoning
Inspector from whom the appeal is taken on due cause shown.
(Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)
1123.04 VARIANCES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such
variances from the terms of the Zoning Ordinance as will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship. No
nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in other
districts shall be considered grounds for issuance of a variance. Variances
shall not be granted on the grounds of convenience or profit, but only where
strict application of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance would result in
unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application and Standards for Variances. The Zoning Board of Appeals
shall not vary the regulations of the Zoning Ordinance, as authorized in this
section, unless and until a written application for a variance is submitted to
the Zoning Inspector and the Board of Zoning Appeals containing:
      (1)   Name, address, and phone number of applicants;
      (2)   Legal description of property;
      (3)   Description of nature or variance requested;
      (4)   Narrative statements which demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Board of Zoning Appeals that the variance conforms to the following standards:
         A.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience
if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out;
         B.   The conditions upon which an application for a variance is based
are unique to the property for which the variance is sought, and are not
applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification.
         C.   The purpose of the variance is not based exclusively upon desire
to increase financial gain;
         D.   The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by the Zoning
Ordinance and has not been created by any persons presently having an interest
in the property;
         E.   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located; and
         F.   The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion of the
public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety,
or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
         G.   The Zoning Board of Appeals may impose such conditions and
restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variance as may be necessary to
comply with the standards established in this section and the objectives of
this Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   Authorized Variances. Variances from the regulations of the Zoning
Ordinance shall not be granted unless the Board makes specific findings of fact
based directly on the particular evidence presented to it, which supports
conclusions that the standards and conditions imposed in subsection (a) hereof
have been met by the applicant. Variances may be granted as guided by the
following:
      (1)   To permit any yard or setback less than a yard or a setback
required by the applicable regulations;
      (2)   To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise prohibited
solely because of the insufficient area or width of the lot or lots, but
generally the respective area and width of the lot or lots should not be less
than eighty percent (80%) of the required area and width;
      (3)   To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as
required facilities for two or more uses, provided that substantial use of such
facility by each user does not take place at approximately the same hours of
the same days of the week;
      (4)   To reduce the applicable off-street parking or loading facilities
required by generally not more than one parking space or loading space, or
twenty-five percent (25%) of the required facilities, whichever number is
greater;
      (5)   To allow the deferment of required parking facilities for a
reasonable period of time, such period of time to be specified in the variance;
      (6)   To increase the maximum distance that required parking spaces are
permitted to be located from the use served but generally not more than forty
percent (40%);
      (7)   To increase the maximum allowable size or area of signs on a lot
but generally by not more than twenty-five percent (25%);
      (8)   To increase the maximum gross floor area of any use so limited by
the applicable regulations but generally not more than twenty-five percent
(25%);
      (9)   To modify the supplemental yard and height regulations found in
Chapter
1159.
No order of the Zoning Board of Appeals granting a variance shall be valid for
a period longer than twelve months from the date of such order unless the
building permit or zoning approval is obtained within such period and the
erection or alteration of a building is started or the use is commenced within
such period.
(Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)
1123.05 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   Under no circumstances shall the Board of Zoning Appeals grant an appeal or
variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of the Zoning Ordinance
in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by
the terms of the Zoning Ordinance in such district. In granting any appeal or
variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and
safeguards in conformity with the Zoning Ordinance. Violations of such
conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the appeal
or variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of the Zoning Ordiance and
punishable under Section
1119.99.
(Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)
1123.06 PUBLIC HEARING BY THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.

Inspector or an applicant.

supplementary conditions as specified in Section
1123.05 or disapprove the request for appeal or variance. The Board of Zoning
Appeals shall further make a finding that the reasons set forth in the
application justify the granting of the variance that will make possible a

1125.07 DUTIES OF THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   In exercising its duties, the Board of Zoning Appeals may, as long as such
action is in conformity with the terms of the Zoning Ordinance, reverse or
affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or
determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have the powers of the
Zoning Inspector from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of three
members of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be necessary to reverse any order,
requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning Inspector, or to decide in
favor of the application on any matter upon which it is required to pass under
the Zoning Ordinance or to effect any variation in the application of the
Zoning Ordinance. For the purpose of the Zoning Ordinance the Board of Zoning
Appeals has the following specific responsibilities:
   (a)    To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in
any order, requirement, decision, interpretation, or determination made by the
Zoning Inspector.
   (b)   To authorize such variances from the terms of the Zoning Ordinance as
will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to the special
conditions, a literal enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance will result in
unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the Zoning Ordinance shall be
observed and substantial justice done.
   (c)   Review conditional use permits as specified in the Official Schedule
of District Regulations and under the conditions specified in Chapter
1191 and such additional safeguards as will uphold the intent of the Zoning
Ordinance.
      (Ord. 2007-03. Passed 2-2-07.)
1125.08 RESPONSIBILITIES OF ZONING INSPECTOR, BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS, COUNCIL
AND COURTS ON MATTERS OF APPEAL.
   (a)   It is the intent of the Zoning Ordinance that all questions of
interpretation and enforcement shall be first presented to the Zoning
Inspector, and that such questions shall be presented to the Board of Zoning
Appeals only on appeal from the decision of the Zoning Inspector, and that
recourse from the decisions of the Board shall be to the courts as provided by
law.
   (b)   It is further the intent of the Zoning Ordinance that the duties of
Council, in connection with the Zoning Ordinance, shall not include hearing and
deciding questions of interpretation and enforcement that may arise. The
procedure for deciding such questions shall be as stated in this section and
the Zoning Ordinance. Under the Zoning Ordinance Council shall have only the
duties of considering and adopting or rejecting proposed amendments or the
repeal of the Zoning Ordinance as provided by law, and of establishing a
schedule of fees and charges as stated in Section
1119.12. Nothing in the Zoning Ordinance shall be interpreted to prevent any
official of the Village from appealing a decision of the Board of Zoning
Appeals to the courts as provided in Chapters 2505 and 2506 of the Ohio Revised
Code. Any such appeal shall be made within thirty days of the Board's written
decision.

establishments permitted in the Neighborhood Business District will be closely
associated with residential, religious, recreational and educational land uses
at the neighborhood level, more restrictive requirements for light, air, and
open space are necessitated than in other commercial zoning districts. (Ord.

1159.01 TYPES OF PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS.
   Types of planned developments include PR (Planned Residential District), PMH
(Planned Mobile Home Residential District), PC (Planned Commercial District),
PI (Planned Industrial District). Use groupings within each district shall be
governed by the requirements specified for each respective district described
within Section
1159.09 through
1159.12.
(Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)
1159.02 PURPOSES.
   (a)   Planned developments are of such substantially different character
from other conditional uses that specific and additional standards and
exceptions are hereby established to govern the actions of the Planning
Commission.
   (b)   Planned development zoning is a privilege to be earned and not a right
which can be claimed simply upon complying with all the standards established
in this section. The Planning Commission and/or Council may require any
reasonable condition or design consideration which will promote proper
development of benefit to the community. It is not intended that the Commission
and/or Council automatically grant the maximum use exceptions or density
increase in the case of each planned development. The Commission and Council
shall grant only such increase or latitude which is consistent with the benefit
accruing to the Village as the result of the planned development. As a
condition for approval, each planned development must be compatible with the
character and objectives of the zoning district or districts within which it is
located, and each planned development shall be consistent with the objectives
of the Lewisburg Land Development Plan.
   (c)   Some specific purpose of the planned development procedure are:
      (1)   To take advantage of advances in technology, architectural design,
and functional land use design;
      (2)   To recognize the problems of population density, distribution and
circulation and to allow a deviation from rigid established patterns of land
uses, but controlled by defined policies and objectives;
      (3)   To produce a comprehensive development equal to or better than that
resulting from traditional lot by lot land use development;
      (4)   To permit flexibility of design in the placement, height, and uses
of buildings and open spaces, circulation facilities and off-street parking
areas, and to more efficiently utilize potentials of site, characterized by
special features of geography, topography, size or shape.
   (d)   General Standards for Planned Development (See Sections
1159.09 through
1159.12 for specific standards for respective planned development districts.)
   (e)   The Planning Commission shall not approve a request for a Planned
Development unless it shall, in each specific case, make specific findings of
facts directly based upon the particular evidence presented to it, which
supports conclusions that:
      (1)   The Planned Development can be substantially completed within the
period of time specified in the schedule of development submitted by the
developer.
      (2)   The site will be accessible from public roads that are adequate to
carry the traffic that will be imposed upon them by the proposed development
and the streets and driveways on the site of the proposed development will be
adequate to serve the residents or occupants of the proposed development.
      (3)   The development will not impose an undue burden on public services
and facilities, such as utilities, fire, and police protection.
      (4)   The Development Plan contains such proposed covenants, easements,
and other provisions relating to the proposed development standards, as
reasonable as are required for the public health, safety and welfare.
      (5)   The location and arrangement of structures, parking areas, walks,
lighting, and appurtenant facilities shall be compatible with the surrounding
land uses, and any part of a Planned Development not used for structures,
parking and loading areas, or accessways, shall be landscaped or otherwise
improved.
      (6)   Natural features such as water courses, trees, and rock outcrops
will be preserved, to the degree possible, so that they can be incorporated
into the layout to enhance the overall design of the Planned Development.
      (7)   The layout must be designed to take advantage of the existing land
contours in order to provide satisfactory road gradients and suitable building
lots and to facilitate the provisions of proposed services.
      (8)   In any development which is primarily designed for or occupied by
dwellings, all electric and telephone facilities, steet light wiring, and other
wiring conduits and similar facilities shall be placed underground by the
developer, unless waived by the Planning Commission because of the technical
reasons.
         (Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)
1159.03 PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL.
   (a)   Preapplication Conference.
      (1)   Prior to filing a formal application for approval of a Planned
Development, the developer shall request a preapplication conference with the
Planning Commission.
      (2)   The purpose of such conference is to allow the developer to present
a general concept of his proposed development prior to the preparation of
detailed plans. For this purpose the presentation shall include, but not be
limited to, the following:
         A.   Written "letter of intent" from the developer establishing his
intentions as to development of the land.
         B.   Topographic survey and location map.
         C.   Sketch plans and ideas regarding land use, dwelling type and
density, street and lot arrangement, and tentative lot sizes.
         D.   Tentative proposals regarding water supply, sewage disposal,
surface drainage, and street improvements.
      (3)   The Planning Commission shall advise the developer of the zoning
requirements and Village Plans which might affect the proposed development as
well as the procedural steps for approval.
   (b)   Preliminary Plan. The Preliminary Plans of the Planned Development
shall be filed with the Zoning Inspector, who shall in turn forward copies to
the Planning Commission for consideration.
   The required procedure for consideration and approval of the preliminary
plan shall be:
      (1)   Submission of the following:
         A.   Written application for approval of a Planned Development shall
be made on forms and in the manner prescribed by the Village.
         B.   The application shall be accompanied by a fee consistent with
Section
1119.12.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall study material received and confer
with other agencies of government as appropriate in the case to determine
general acceptability of the proposal as submitted. In the course of such
preliminary consideration, the Planning Commission may request and the
applicant shall supply additional material needed to make specific
determinations.
      (3)   Following such study, the Planning Commission or its staff shall
hold a conference or conferences with the applicant to discuss desirable
changes in the first or succeeding drafts of the preliminary development plan
and report.
      (4)   Recommendations of the Planning Commission to the applicant shall
be in writing, and following any such conference, agreements between the
applicant and the Planning Commission as to changes in the preliminary plan and
report or other matters to be recorded and acknowleged by the Planning
Commission and the applicant. On items on which no agreement is reached, or
there is specific disagreement, this fact shall be recorded, and the applicant
may place in the record his reasons for any disagreement.
      (5)   When the preliminary development plan and report has been approved
in principle (as a whole or with reservations specifically indicated) or when
the applicant indicates in writing that no further negotiations with the
Planning Commission are desired before proceeding, the Planning Commission
shall schedule the proposed plan for a public hearing, following which it shall
make its recommendations to Council. Such recommendations shall indicate
approval, approval with specific reservations, or disapproval with reasons.
With such recommendations, the Planning Commission shall transmit within sixty
days the latest draft of the preliminary plan and report submitted by the
applicant, a record of agreements reached, and matters on which there was no
specific agreement, including any reasons recorded by the applicant for any
such disagreement.
      (6)   Council shall schedule a public hearing for the preliminary plan
and respective planned development zone designation after receiving the
proposal from the Planning Commission. Within sixty days, Council shall approve
the proposal, approve subject to conditions, or deny the proposal. If approved,
the area of land marked shall be redesigned PR (Planned Residential District),
PMH (Planned Mobile Home Residential District), PC (Planned Commercial
District), or PI (Planned Industrial District), and shall be used only in
accordance with the uses and densities shown on the Planned Development
Preliminary Plan.
   (c)   Final Plan. The final Planned Development plan shall conform
substantially to the preliminary plan. If desired by the developer, it may be
submitted in stages with each stage reflecting a portion of the approved
preliminary plan which is proposed to be recorded and developed; provided,
however, that such portion conforms to all requirements of these regulations.
The required procedure for approval of a final plan shall be:
      (1)   The final plan and supporting data shall be filed with the Zoning
Inspector who in turn forwards copies to the Planning Commission for
certification that the final plan is in conformity with these regulations and
in agreement with the approved preliminary plan.
      (2)   After review of the final plan and supporting data, the Planning
Commission shall approve or disapprove the plan within sixty days after
submittal by the developer. Disapproval of the final plan shall include a clear
statement of the reasons therefor.
      (3)   The Planning Commission shall then forward the final plan together
with their recommendations to Council. Council shall review the recommendations
of the Planning Commission at the next regular meeting of Council, and shall
approve, approve subject to conditions, or deny the final application.
   (d)   Recording of Final Development Plan.
      (1)   After approval by Council of the final plan, the Zoning Inspector
shall see that all requirements of Section
1159.14 have been complied with before the Final Development Plan is presented
to the Preble County Recorder for recording.
      (2)   The purpose of such recording is to designate with particularity
the land subdivided into conventional lots as well as the dimension of other
lands, not so treated, into common open areas and building areas, and to
designate each building or structure, as well as the use of the land in
general.
      (3)   No Final Development Plan within the corporate limits of Lewisburg
shall be so recorded unless it shall have the approval of Council inscribed
thereon.
   (e)   Building Permit. No building permit shall be issued by the Building
Inspector until the Final Development Plan has been approved and duly recorded
and the Planning Commission has approved the detailed plans (described in
Section
1159.14 (c)).
 
   (f)   Utilities. The building official shall issue no certificate of
occupancy until all utilities have been accepted by the Village in accordance
with the Final Development Plan.
(Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)
1159.04 CHANGES IN THE PLANNED DEVELOPMENT.
   A Planned Development shall be developed only according to the approved and
recorded final plan and all supporting data. The recorded final plan and
supporting data together with all recorded amendments shall be binding on the
applicants, their successors, grantees and assigns and shall limit and control
the use or premises (including the interval use of buildings and structures)
and location of structures in the Planned Development as set forth therein.
   (a)   Major Changes. Changes which alter the concept or intent of the
Planned Development including increases in the number of units per acre, change
in location or amount of non-residential land uses, more than fifteen percent
(15%) modification in proportion of housing types, significant redesign of
roadways, utilities or drainage, may be approved only by submission of a new
preliminary plan and supporting data, and following the "preliminary approval"
steps and subsequent amendment of the final Planned Development Plan.
   (b)   Minor Changes. The Zoning Inspector, upon notifying the Planning
Commission, may jointly approve minor changes in the Planned Development which
do not change the concept or intent of the development, without going through
the "preliminary approval" steps. Minor changes are defined as any change not
defined as a major change.
      (Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)
1159.05 SCHEDULE OF CONSTRUCTION.
   The Planning Commission shall consider the planned development subject to
revocation if construction falls more than one year behind the schedule filed
with the final plan.
(Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)
1159.06 EFFECT OF DENIAL OF A PLANNED DEVELOPMENT.
   No application for a planned development, which has been denied wholly or in
part by the Planning Commission and Council shall be resubmitted for a period
of one year from the date of such order of denial, except on the grounds of new
evidence or proof of change of conditions found to be valid by the Planning
Commission and Council.
(Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)
1159.07 REVOCATION.
   In any case where a planned development has not been established
(substantially under way) within one year from the date of granting thereof,
then, without further action by the Planning Commission, the planned
development authorization thereof shall be null and void.
(Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)

(Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)
1159.09 PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   Policies Underlying Use of Zone. This district is intended to provide
a good deal of flexibility in the arrangement and design of residential
dwellings, based upon a unified development plan conceived and carried out for
an entire area. Within this district, appropriate and reasonable population
density is maintained while a variety of dwelling unit types is permitted.
Natural features such as topography, trees and drainage ways are encouraged to
remain in their natural state to the degree possible. Such developments are
generally characterized by a significant proportion of usable open space, and a
unified design concept with particular attention devoted to the periphery of
the development, with the objective being the compatibility of the development
with its surroundings.
   (b)   Permitted Uses.
      (1)   Those uses included as permitted and accessory uses in R-1 through
R-3 Residential Districts developed in a unified manner in accordance with the
approved development plan.

established as necessary for the proper development of the community and to be
so located, designated and operated to serve primarily the needs of the persons
within the Planned Development if specifically approved as part of the Planned
Development Plan. Uses shall be generally limited to those uses permitted in
the NB District, with no direct access or advertising signs for such uses to be
visible from the exterior of the development.
      (3)   Such convenience establishments and their parking areas shall not
occupy more than five percent (5%) of the total area of the development.
      (4)   No separate building or structure designed or intended to be used,
in whole or part, for business purposes within a Residential Planned
Development shall be constructed prior to the construction of not less than
thirty percent (30%) of the dwelling units proposed in the development plan.
   (c)   Area Requirements. The minimum land area required for a Planned
Residential Development shall be five acres. This area requirement may be
varied at the discretion of the Planning Commission and Council if it can be
demonstrated that a variance is necessary to achieve an improved site design
and that surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities will not be adversely
affected.
   (d)   Density Requirements. Any combination or cluster of housing units is
permitted, provided that the average lot area per family or dwelling unit
contained in the site, exclusive of the area of street rights-of-way, parking
areas and commercial area, will not be less than eighty percent (80%) of the
lot area per family required in the district in which the site is located. This
density requirement may be varied at the discretion of the Planning Commission
and Council if it can be demonstrated that a variance is necessary to achieve
an improved site design and that surrounding neighborhoods and public
facilities will not be adversely affected.
   (e)   Site Design.
      (1)   Alll housing shall be sited to preserve privacy and to ensure
natural light.
      (2)   Lot widths may be varied to permit a variety of structural designs.

development shall not exceed thirty five feet, unless it can be demonstrated
that an additional height is required with provisions of suitable open space to
protect adjacent structures from adverse reduction of light and air.
   (i)   Set Back and Screening. A set back of fifty feet shall be provided
along the entire perimeter of the development and retained in natural woods, or
be suitably landscaped with grass and/or ground cover, shrubs and trees.
Projects located adjacent to Commercial or Industrially zoned areas shall
provide screening facilities comprising landscaping, walls or both which will
provide suitable protection to the residential development as adjudged by the
Planning Commission and Village Council. Screening facilities shall not obscure
traffic visibility within fifty feet of an intersection.
   (j)   Common Open Space. A minimum of twenty five percent (25%) of the land
in any planned residential development shall be reserved for permanent common
open space and recreational facilities for the residents or users of the area
being developed. Only areas having minimum dimensions of fifty feet by 100 feet
shall qualify for computation as usable open spaces.
   (k)   Parking Requirements. See Chapter
1183 for required spaces and design criteria.
   (l)   Signs. See Chapter
1187 for size and location of permitted signs.
(Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)

   (a)   Scope of Regulations. The off-street parking and loading requirements
of the Zoning Ordinance shall apply as follows:
      (1)   For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land
established after the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance, accessory parking
and loading facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations of the
districts in which such buildings or uses are located. However, where a
building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of the Zoning
Ordinance and provided that construction is begun within six months of such
effective date and diligently pursued to completion, parking and loading
facilities in the amounts required for the issuance of the building permit may
be provided in lieu of any different amounts required by the Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   When the intensity of use of any building, structure, or premises
shall be increased through the addition of dwelling units, gross floor area,
seating capacity, or other units of measurement specified herein for required
parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required
herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use and for at least
fifty percent (50%) of any existing deficiency in parking or loading
facilities.
      (3)   Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall
hereafter be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be
provided as required for such new use. However, if the building or structure
was erected prior to the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance, additional
parking or loading facilities are mandatory only in the amount by which the
requirements for the new use would exceed those for the existing use, if the
latter were subject to the parking and loading provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance.
   (b)   Existing Parking and Loading Facilities.
      (1)   Off-street parking and loading facilities in existence on the
effective date of the Zoning Ordinance and located on the same lot as the
building or use served shall not hereafter be reduced below, or if already less
than, shall not be further reduced below, the requirements for a similar new
building or use under the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   Any area once designated as required off-street parking or loading
shall never be changed to any other use unless and until equal facilities are
provided elsewhere.
         (Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)
1183.02 OFF-STREET PARKING.
   (a)   Location. The off-street parking required by this chapter shall be
provided in accordance with the following requirements.
      (1)   One and two-family dwellings. The off-street parking facilities
required for one and two-family dwellings should be located on the same lot or
plot of ground as the building they are intended to serve, but shall not be
considered a parking lot under the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   Multiple family. The off-street parking facilities for multi-family
dwellings shall consist of a parking lot as defined elsewhere in this chapter.
In no event shall any uncovered parking space in a Multi-family District be
located nearer than ten feet to any building.
         (Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)
      (3)   Manufactured home parks. The off-street parking required may be
located on each site or in parking lots conveniently located and readily
accessible to each site. (Ord. 1996-22. Passed 12-26-96.)
      (4)   Other land uses. The off-street parking required may be located on
each site or in parking lots conveniently located and readily accessible to
each site. Such off-lot spaces shall be located only in districts in which
similar off-street parking is permitted.
      (5)   Control of off-site parking facilities. In cases where parking
facilities are permitted on land other than the zoning lot on which the
building or use served is located, such facilities shall be in the same
possession as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use to which the
parking facilities are accessory. Such possession may be either by deed or
long-term lease, the term of such lease, to be determined by the Building
Inspector; and such deed or lease shall be filed with the Village Clerk. The
deed or lease shall require such owner or his or her heirs and assigns to
maintain the required number of parking facilities for the duration of the use
served or of the deed or lease, whichever shall terminate sooner.
   (b)   Construction Requirements. All parking facilities required for uses
other than single and two-family dwellings shall be hard-surfaced with a
pavement having an asphalt or concrete binder, shall be graded and drained so
as to dispose of surface water which might accummulate within or upon such
area, and shall be completely constructed prior to a Certificate of Occupancy
being issued. No surface water from such parking area shall be permitted to
drain into adjoining private property. Each parking facility must meet any
other engineering standards deemed necessary by the Zoning Inspector. All
parking facilities required for single and two-family dwellings, unless
specifically provided for otherwise by the Planning Commission, shall be
surfaced with a dust-free and durable material, and shall be graded and drained
to dispose of surface water.
   (c)   Parking Lot Plans. Plans for the development of any parking lot must
be submitted to the Zoning Inspector, prepared at a scale of not less than
fifty feet equals one inch and indicating existing and proposed grades,
drainage, pipe sizes, dimensions of parking spaces, type of curbing, drive and
aisle dimensions, lighting, adjacent main buildings, sidewalks, landscaping
surfacing and base materials to be used. The plans of the proposed parking lot
layout shall be proposed in a presentable form by person or persons competent
in such work and shall reflect conformance with the following provisions.
      (1)   Parking space dimensions. Plans for the layout of off-street
parking facilities should be in accordance with the minimum standards contained
in Table A. The minimum parking space dimensions for a layout not provided for
in this table shall be nine and one-half feet in width, twenty feet in length,
and 189 square feet in area.
      (2)   Required yards.
         A.   Off-street parking spaces, open to the sky, may be located in any
yard if the parking facility is located within a commercial or industrial zone,
except that when a required nonresidential parking lot or parking area is
situated on a parcel which adjoins a residential district or a residential use,
abutting directly or across a roadway, the respective side or rear yard setback
shall be a minimum of twenty feet, of which the ten feet nearest the respective
property line is developed as a greenbelt.
         B.   Within the Residential Districts, it shall be unlawful to use the
space between the front setback line and the sidewalk for the parking of
trailers, mobile homes, motor homes and recreational vehicles.
         C.   Parking facilities in commercial and industrial districts are
encouraged to be located behind the front yard setback line whenever possible.
         D.   Enclosed buildings and carports containing off-street parking
shall be subject to applicable yard requirements of the zone in which located.
      (3)   Screening and landscaping.
         A.   All open vehicle parking areas containing more than three parking
spaces shall be effectively screened on each side adjoining or fronting on
property situated in a Residence District or any institutional premises by a
wall, fence of densely planted coniferous hedge or planting not less than four
feet or more than eight feet in height.
         B.   All parts of open off-street parking areas which are unusable
either for parking or for traffic, as well as all required yard areas shall be
landscaped with grass, coniferous shrubs, evergreen material and/or ornamental
trees. All such landscaping and planting shall be maintained in a healthy,
growing condition, neat and orderly in appearance.
      (4)   Access.
         A.   All off-street parking facilities shall be designed with
appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner which
will least interfere with traffic movement. Access to parking areas in
Commercial District (with the exception of shopping centers in these districts)
shall be provided from a service drive where required. Access to such parking
areas by curb cuts or driveways across the front lot line should be avoided
wherever possible.
         B.   Ingress and egress to a parking lot lying in an area zoned for
other than single-family residential use shall not be across land zoned for
single-family residential use.
         C.   Each entrance and exit to and from any off-street parking lot
located in an area zoned for other than single-family residential use shall be
at least twenty-five feet distant from adjacent property located in any single-
family residential district.
      (5)   Lighting. All illumination for or on all such parking lots shall be
deflected away from adjacent residential areas and shall be installed in such a
manner as to allow the reduction of the amount of light in other than normal
parking hours each day. The source of illumination in all parking lots abutting
a residential area shall not be more than sixteen feet above the parking lot
surface.
      (6)   Wheel stops. All parking lots shall be provided with wheel stops or
bumper guards so located as to prevent any vehicle from projecting over the lot
or setback lines.
      (7)   Cleaning and maintenance. The parking facility shall be kept free
from refuse and debris and in good structural condition through periodic
maintenance by the owner or his agent, who shall also be responsible for snow
removal.
         (Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)
1183.03 PARKING SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Computation. When determination of the number of off-street parking
spaces required by the Zoning Ordinance results in a requirement of a
fractional space, any fraction of less than one-half may be disregarded, while
a fraction of one-half or more, shall be counted as one parking space. Parking
spaces required on an employee basis shall be based on the maximum number of
employees on duty or residing, or both, on the premises at any one time.
   (b)   Collective Provisions.
      (1)   Off-street parking facilities for separate uses may be provided
collectively if the total number of spaces so provided is not less than the sum
of the separate requirements governing location of accessory parking spaces in
relation to the use served are adhered to. Further, no parking space or portion
thereof shall serve as a required space for more than one use unless otherwise
authorized by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Parking spaces already provided to meet off-street parking
requirements for places of public assembly, commercial or industrial
establishments, lying within 500 feet of a church measured along lines of
public access; and that are not normally used between the hours of 6 a.m. and 6
p.m. on Sundays; and that are made available to the respective church for
parking use, may be used to meet not more than seventy-five percent (75%) of
the off-street parking requirements of such church.
   (c)   Utilization. Except as may otherwise be provided for the parking of
trucks in the granting of conditional uses, required accessory off-street
parking facilities provided for uses listed in Table B shall be solely for the
parking of passenger automobiles of patrons, occupants, or employees of such
uses.
   (d)   Parking Restrictions. Off-street parking of vehicles shall be further
restricted by the following requirements:
      (1)   Parking duration. Except when land is used as storage space in
connection with the business of a repair or service garage, a twenty-four hour
time limit for parking in nonresidential off-street parking areas shall
prevail, it being the purpose and intention of the foregoing that the
requirement of maintaining vehicle storage or parking space is to provide for
the public safety in keeping parked cars off the streets, but such requirement
is not designed to or intended to provide, and it shall be unlawful to permit,
the storage or prolonged parking on any such parking area in any such District
wrecked or junked cars, or for creating a junk yard or a nuisance in such
areas.
      (2)   Restriction on parking on private property. It shall be unlawful
for any person, firm or corporation to park any motor vehicle on any private
property, or use of the private property as parking space, without the express
or implied consent, authorization, or ratification of the owner, holder,
occupant, lessee, agent, or trustee of such property. Complaint for the
violation of this provision shall be made by the owner, holder, occupant,
lessee, agent or trustee of such property.
      (3)   Trucks, construction equipment etc. After the effective date of the
Zoning Ordinance it shall be unlawful for the owner, tenant or lessee of any
lot, parcel or tract of land in a residential district or in the residential
area of any other district, to permit or allow the open storage or parking,
either day or night, thereon of trucks, semitrucks and trailers, mobile homes
(exclusive of recreational vehicles), bulldozers, earth carriers, drag lines,
cranes, steam shovels and/or any other equipment or machinery. It is provided,
however, that the owner, tenant or lessee of a farm may openly store the
machinery and equipment used on his farm; and it is further provided that
equipment necessary to be parked overnight on a lot, parcel or tract of land
during construction work thereon shall be excepted from this restriction.
   (e)   Specific Requirements.
      (1)   All off-street parking spaces hereinafter required by the Zoning
Ordinance shall be designed in accordance with one of the formulas set forth in
Table A.
      (2)   Off-street parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with the
space requirements for respective types of land use as set forth in Table B.
Parking spaces for accessory uses not specifically enumerated within a parking
class shall be assumed to be included in the principal (permitted or
conditional) use requirement. If, for any reason, the classification of any
use, for the purpose of determining the amount of off-street parking, or the
number of spaces to be provided by such use is not readily determinable
hereunder, the parking class of such use shall be fixed by the Zoning
Inspector.

1187.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote and protect the public health,
welfare, and safety by regulating existing and proposed outdoor advertising,
outdoor advertising signs, and outdoor signs of all types. It is intended to
protect the physical appearance of the Village, and preserve the scenic and
natural beauty of designated areas. It is further intended to reduce sign or
advertising distraction and obstructions that may contribute to traffic
accidents, reduce hazards that may be caused by signs overhanging or projecting
over public rights of way, provide more open space, curb the deterioration of
the natural environment, and enhance Village development.
(Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)
1187.02 GOVERNMENTAL SIGNS EXCLUDED.

contain flashing, intermittent, rotating, or moving light or lights. In no
event shall an illuminated sign or lighting device be placed or directed so as
to permit the beams and illumination therefrom to be directed or beamed upon a
public thoroughfare, highway, sidewalk, or adjacent premises so as to cause
glare or reflection that may constitute a traffic hazard or nuisance.
   (b)   No sign shall employ any parts or elements which revolve, rotate,

   (f)   No portable or temporary sign shall be placed on the front or face of
a building or on any premises, except as provided in Section
1187.15.
   (g)   No sign or part thereof shall contain or consist of banners, posters,
pennants, ribbons, streamers, spinners, or other similar moving devices. Such

the person, firm or corporation responsible for maintaining the sign.
   (k)   Should any sign be or become unsafe or be in danger of falling, the

909.01 of the Lewisburg Codified Ordinances as having a temporary use permit.
The Zoning Inspector shall work with all owners and occupiers of land within
the Village to make a reasonably accurate record of said existing canopies,
awnings, marquees, and signs that overhang or project over or into a public
right-of-way. Owners and occupiers of land on said record need not comply with
the remaining provisions of this Section.
   (b)   All future to be erected canopies, awnings, marquees, and signs that
overhang or project over or into a public right-of-way must first receive a

   (e)   Upon receipt of a temporary use permit, the owners and occupiers of
land shall erect the canopy, awning, marquee, or sign within thirty days of
receiving said permit or said permit will be void. Upon inspection and final
approval by the Zoning Inspector, the temporary use permit shall be fully
valid, subject to the terms and conditions of this chapter.

shall not be granted to the offending party to again erect any canopy, awning,
marquee, or sign that overhangs or projects over or into a public right-of-way
unless the offending party first reimburses the Village for the cost of
abatement, demolition, and/or removal.

1189.08  HEARING ON PUBLIC NEED AS TO RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   (a)   Whenever a permitted temporary use of a public right-of-way is a
public nuisance or a real obstruction or menace to the public use of said
right-of-way or whenever said use would interfere with a proposed public use or
purpose of said right-of-way, Council may set and conduct a public hearing to
determine whether or not a temporary use permit should be terminated and
whether or not the temporarily permitted canopy, awning, marquee, or sign that
overhangs or projects over or into a public right-of-way should be terminated
or abated.
   (b)   Notice of the public hearing shall be given by Council by at least one
publication in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the Village at
least thirty days before the date of the hearing. The published notice shall

public right-of-way, the Zoning Inspector shall cause such order to be carried

1191.01 GENERAL.
   It is recognized that an increasing number of new kinds of uses are
appearing daily, and that many of these and some other more conventional uses
posse characteristics of such unique and special nature relative to location,
design, size, method of operation, circulation, and public facilities that each
specific use must be considered individually. These specific uses as they are
conditionally permitted under the provisions of Chapter
1139  to
1183  shall follow the procedures and requirements set forth in Sections
1191.02  and
1191.03 .
(Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)

signs, yards, and such other information as the Board may require to determine
if the proposed conditional use meets the intent and requirements of this
Zoning Ordinance.
      (7)   A narrative statement evaluating the effects on adjoining property;
the effect of such elements as noise, glare, odor, fumes and vibration on
adjoining property; and discussion of the general compatibility with adjacent
and other properties in the district; and the relationship of the proposed use
to the Zoning District Map.
      (8)   The fee payment for Conditional Zoning permits.
   (b)   Review by Board of Zoning Appeals. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall
review the proposed development as presented on the submitted plans and
specifications in terms of the standards established in the Zoning Ordinance.
Such review shall be completed and a public hearing held according to the
procedures specified in Sections
1121.06  to
1121.08  within a sixty day period following the submission of such
application.
 
   (c)   Action by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Within thirty days after the
public hearing required in subsection (b) hereof, the Board shall either
approve, approve with supplementary conditions as specified in Section
1123.05 , or disapprove the application as presented. If the application is
approved or approved with modifications, the Board shall direct the Zoning
Inspector to issue a conditional use permit listing the specific conditions
specified by the Board for approval. If the application is disapproved by the
Board, the applicant may seek relief through the Court of Common Pleas. Appeals
from Board decisions shall be made in the manner specified in Section
1125.08 .
   (d)   Issuance and Revocation of Conditional Use Permit. Only upon
conclusions of hearing procedures relative to a particular application may the

safeguard, or requirement shall automatically invalidate the permit granted,
and shall constitute a violation of this Zoning Ordinance. Such violation shall
be punishable as specified in Section
1119.99 .
   (e)   Expiration of Conditional Use Permit. A conditional use permit shall
be deemed to authorize only one particular conditional use and the permit shall
automatically expire if, for any reason, the conditional use shall cease for
more than two years.
   (f)   Reapplication. No application for a Conditional Use Permit which had
been denied wholly or in part by the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be
resubmitted until the expiration of one year or more from the date of such
denial, except on grounds of newly discovered evidence or proof of changed
conditions which would be sufficient to justify reconsideration by the Board of
Zoning Appeals.

1191.03 STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR CONDITIONAL USES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall establish beyond reasonable doubt that

conditional use indicated herein shall be satisfied by the establishment and
operation of the proposed conditional use. The Board of Zoning Appeals may also

and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property,
or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise,

designed as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
thoroughfares.

solids, to secure:
            a.   That the excavated area shall not collect and permit to remain
therein stagnant water, or,
            b.   That the surface of such area which is not permanently
submerged is graded or backfilled as necessary so as to reduce the peaks and
depressions thereof so as to produce a gently running surface that will
minimize erosion due to rainfall and which will be in substantial conformity to
the adjoining land area. The banks of all excavations not backfilled shall be
sloped which shall not be less than three feet horizontal to one foot vertical
and such bank shall be seeded.
         2.   All banks and extracted areas shall be surfaced with at least six

fill, and to prevent the collection of standing water.
      W.   An inspection of the entire site shall be made by a representative
of the County Health Department before the earthmoving equipment is removed
from the site. Any necessary corrective work shall be performed before the
landfill project is accepted as completed. Arrangements shall be made for the
repair of all cracked, eroded, and uneven areas in the final cover during the
year following completion of the fill.
      X.   Domestic animals shall be excluded from the site.
   (17)   Automobile service stations, repair garages, filling stations.

less than twenty feet in width. Such grass strips and shrubs shall be
maintained in good condition.
      This standard is not mandatory when the business is separated from the
residential property by a public street. Such sight-proofing screening
provisions shall appear on the site plan submitted for a building permit, and
shall be physically constructed when the business is occupied. These screening
requirements may be waived if the business is effectively screened by natural
topography. The Board of Appeals shall determine by whatever means it deems
necessary to make such determination, and grant such relief from this standard
in writing to the proposed user of the land.
      M.   A raised curb six inches high and six inches wide shall be
constructed along all street frontages, except within driveway openings, and
shall form an island having a minimum width of two feet. Such areas shall be
landscaped by use of either of two foot berm, or landscape material two feet in
height at installation with proper setback for safety. All such landscaped
areas shall be adequately protected by a raised curb of not more than six
inches in height, or a bumper guard.

         2.   Identification of similar facilities presently existing within
the County and its municipalities.
         3.   A license or evidence of ability to obtain a license, if such is
required, from the pertinent governmental unit prior to operation. Prior to the
issuance of a final Certificate of Occupancy, the operator or agency shall
provide evidence that a valid license has been issued or is obtainable for the
proposed special use on the subject property. If licensing is not available, a
verified affidavit so stating shall be presented.
         4.   A copy of the sponsoring agency's operational and occupancy
standards.
         5.   A detailed plan for services and programs.
      B.   Facility requirements.

occupant, and when occupied by more than one shall contain at least sixty
square foot of habitable room area for each occupant.
         2.   Suitable space shall be provided for indoor and/or outdoor
recreational activities for the clientele served, based upon generally accepted
recreational standards or those specified by the licensing authority.
         3.   No exterior alterations of the structure shall be made which
depart from the residential character of the building. All new structures
prepared shall be of compatible residential design with the surrounding
neighborhood, to the degree possible.
         4.   Off-street parking requirements: One space per every three
persons residing in a family or Community Based Residential Social Service
Facility except for facilities prohibiting ownership or operation of
automobiles by occupants of such facilities. In any case, suitably screened
off-street parking shall be provided on a one-to-one ratio to the number of
autos operated out of the facility. Within neighborhoods in which one-street
parking is accepted practice, on-street space directly abutting the subject lot
may substitute for a proportion of the required off-street spaces if approved
by the Board of Appeals.
         5.   Resident density shall not exceed that density permitted within
the respective zoning district in which the facility is proposed.
      C.   Findings by the Board of Appeals. In its review of each proposed
facility, the Board of Appeals shall make specific findings of fact relative to
the following criteria. The proposed facility:
         1.   Is in fact a community based residential social service facility
licensed by the appropriate authority to provide such service within the State
(and the Village.) If such licensing is not available, a verified affidavit so
stating has been presented to document this statement.
         2.   Is in fact a needed facility in the location proposed, based upon
evidence acceptable to the Board of Appeals.
         3.   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as to
be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or officially
planned uses in the general vicinity and that such use will not change the
essential character of the same area. In this regard, it does not contribute to
a concentration of such facilities in the respective area.
         4.   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or officially
planned future neighboring uses from the standpoint of noise, lights,
congestion or traffic generation which would be incompatible with the
neighborhood environment.
         5.   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal, water and sewer, and schools; or that the persons
or agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able
to provide adequately any such services.
         6.   Will not involve uses, activities and conditions of operation
that will be detrimental to any persons, property, or the general welfare.
         7.   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be so
designed as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
thoroughfares.

1195.01 PURPOSE.
   This Zoning Ordinance establishes separate districts, each of which is an
appropriate area for the location of the uses which are permitted in that
district. Within such established districts as well as those which may be
established by future amendments, there are and will be lots, uses of land,
structures and uses of structures and land in combination which were lawful
before the Zoning Ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be
prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of the Zoning Ordinance or
future amendments. Since such nonconformities are deemed incompatible with the
districts in which they are located, it is the intent of this article to
specify those circumstances and conditions under which such nonconformities
shall be permitted to continue, but not to encouraged their survival. Rather,
it is the intent of the Zoning Ordinance to encourage either for the conversion
of nonconforming uses into conforming uses as soon as reasonably possible or
for their eventual and equitable elimination.
(Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)
1195.02 RESTRICTIONS ON NONCONFORMING BUILDING, STRUCTURES AND USES.
   (a)   General. Any nonconforming building, structure or use which existed
lawfully at the time of the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance and which remains
nonconforming, as well as any which shall become nonconforming, upon any
subsequent amendments thereto, may be continued but shall not be enlarged upon,
expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or
uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. No additional signs intended to
be seen from off the premises shall be utilized in conjunction with
nonconforming uses of land or structures which shall be permitted upon passage
of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   Single Nonconforming Lots of Record. In any district in which single-
family dwellings are pemitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory
buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of the Zoning Ordinance, notwithstanding limitations
imposed by other provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. Such lots must be in
separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same
ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the
requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the
district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those
applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations
for the district in which such lot is located. Variances of requirements listed
in Chapters
1139  to
1183  other than lot area or lot width shall be obtained only through action of
the Board of Zoning Appeals as provided in Sections
1123.04  through
1123.09 .
   (c)   Nonconforming Lots of Record in Combination. If two or more lots or a
combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single
ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of the Zoning
Ordinance and if all or part of the lots with no buildings do not meet the
requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be
considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of the Zoning Ordinance
and no portion of such parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which
diminishes compliance with lot widths and area requirements established by the
Zoning Ordinance, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a
lot with a width or area below the requirements stated in the Zoning Ordinance.
   (d)   Nonconforming Uses of Land. Where, at the time of adoption of the
Zoning Ordinance, lawful uses of land exist which would not be permitted by the
regulations imposed by the Zoning Ordinance the uses may be continued so long
as they remain otherwise lawful, provided:
      (1)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of the Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   No such nonconforming uses shall be moved in whole or in part to
any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of the Zoning Ordinance.
      (3)   If any such nonconforming uses of land are discontinued or
abandoned for more than six months (except when government action impeded
access to the premises), any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the
regulations specified by the Zoning Ordinance for the district in which such
land is located.
      (4)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of the
Zoning Ordinance shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of
land.
   (e)   Nonconforming Structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of the Zoning Ordinance that could not
be built under the terms of the Zoning Ordinance by reason of restriction on
area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, bulk, or other
requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long
as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity;
      (2)   Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means, it shall not be reconstructed except in
conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
      (3)   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
   (f)   Nonconforming Uses of Structures or of Structures and Land in
Combination. If a lawful use involving individual structures, or of a structure
and land in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of the Zoning Ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by the Zoning
Ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
      (2)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of the Zoning Ordinance, but no such use shall be
extended to occupy any land outside such building;
      (3)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure or structure and land, may, upon appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals, be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more
appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting
such change, the Board of Zoning Appeals may require appropriate conditions and
safeguards in accord with other provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
      (4)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a nonconforming use is superceded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not
thereafter be resumed;
      (5)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in
combination is discontinued or abandoned for more than two years, (except when
government action impedes access to the premises), the structure or structure
and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with
the regulations of the district in which it is located;
      (6)   Where nonconforming uses status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
   (g)   Relocation of Building or Structure. No building or structure shall be
moved in whole or in part to any other location on the same or any other lot
unless every portion of such building or structure which is moved, and the use
thereof, is made to conform to all of the regulations of the district in which
it is to be located.
   (h)   Displacement. No nonconforming use shall displace a conforming use.
   (i)   Change in Use. A nonconforming use may be changed to another
nonconforming use provided that the Board of Appeals determines that the
proposed nonconforming use is less in conflict with the character and intent of
the zoning district than the existing nonconforming use.
   (j)   Nonconforming Conditional Uses. Uses existing prior to the enactment
of the Zoning Ordinance which are listed as conditional uses in the district in
which they are located will be considered as nonconforming uses until a
conditional zoning certificate has been applied for and issued for such use.
   (k)   Repairs and Maintenance. On any nonconforming structure or portion of
a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary
repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or
plumbing, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming
shall not be increased. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof
declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public
safety, upon order of such official.
   (l)   Restoration. Whenever a building, the use of which does not conform to
the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance is damaged by fire, explosion, or act of
God to the extent of sixty percent (60%) or more or its assessed value, it
shall not be restored except in conformity with the district regulations of the
district in which it is located.
   (m)   Discontinuance and Abandonment. Whenever a nonconforming use has been
discontinued for a period of six months or more, such discontinuance shall be
considered legal abandonment of the nonconforming use. At the end of that six
month period, the nonconforming use shall not be re-established, and any
further use shall be in conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (n)   Elimination on Nonconforming Signs. Any sign which is nonconforming as
to type, location, zoning district, size, setback, or for any other reason
(except those signs that are an adjunct to the use of any valid nonconforming
building or structure, in which case they shall be regulated by the provisions
applicable to such structure) shall be altered, moved, converted, or removed
within five years of the date of adoption of the Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 82-1. Passed 2-16-82.)
1195.03 AVOIDANCE OF UNDUE HARDSHIP.
   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in the Zoning Ordinance shall be deemed to

1325.01 NUISANCE PROHIBITED.
   No owner of a building or structure within the boundaries of the Village
shall permit the same to remain in such an advanced state of disrepair as to
endanger the health, safety or welfare of the residents of the Village, or so
as to be a public nuisance by reason of its condition.
(Ord. 1988-14. Passed 9-6-88.)
1325.02 RIGHT OF ENTRY.
   The Chief of Police of the Village shall henceforth have the duties of a
Building Nuisance Inspector which duties are provided by this chapter, and he
or his designee shall have free access at any reasonable hour, upon showing
appropriate identification when a building is occupied, to make inspection,
examination and survey of any building, or structure located within the
Municipality, where he has probable cause to believe the building or structure
is unsafe or insecure and thereby dangerous to the residents of the
Municipality. The Fire Chief or his designee may be the designee of the Chief
of Police.
(Ord. 1988-14. Passed 9-6-88.)
1325.03 UNSAFE CONDITIONS; NOTICE TO OWNER.
   Upon a determination by the Building Nuisance Inspector that any building,
or structure is in such advanced state of disrepair by reason of defective or
inadequate plumbing or sanitary facilities or faulty or defective electric
wiring; accumulation of debris, filth, rubbish or garbage, general
deterioration in the structure by reason of age, neglect, exposure to the
elements or vandalism; failure of the exterior enclosure causing exposure to
the elements and general deterioration of the structure; partial damage to the
structure by reason of fire, windstorm or other calamity; or by reason of
deterioration or damage to the foundation, so as to endanger the health, safety
or welfare of the public and that the same is therefore a public nuisance, the
Building Nuisance Inspector shall direct the owner of such building or
structure, in writing by certified mail, at the address of the owner as
disclosed in the County Treasurer's office in the county in which such property
is located and at which address the semi-annual real estate taxes are mailed,
to effect the repairs necessary to put the building in a reasonable safe
condition; or, if the owner is unknown or cannot be located, by publishing a
notice to effect such repairs as are necessary to put the building in a
reasonably safe condition, in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village
for a period of not less than once per week for three consecutive weeks. When
publication is used, a copy of the order shall be tacked onto the building in a
conspicuous place.
(Ord. 1988-14. Passed 9-6-88.)
1325.04 APPEALS.
   Within thirty days after receipt of such notice or the last publication of
the same in a newspaper, as provided herein, the owner may appeal in writing a
finding by the Building Nuisance Inspector that any such building, or structure
is in such an advanced state of disrepair as to endanger the health, safety or
welfare of the public to Council by filing such written appeal with the Clerk
of Council.
(Ord. 1988-14. Passed 9-6-88.)
1325.05 HEARING.

1325.04, Council shall set the matter down for hearing. Such hearing shall be
held not later than thirty days after receipt of the written notice of appeal
by the Clerk, and the owner shall have opportunity to appear before Council and
to present evidence that the building or structure is not in such an advanced
state of disrepair for any of the reasons set forth in Section
1325.03, as to endanger the health, safety or welfare of the public, and
therefore, is not a public nuisance.
(Ord. 1988-14. Passed 9-6-88.)
1325.06 REPAIR OR DEMOLITION.
   (a)   If no appeal is filed from the finding of the Building Nuisance
Inspector within the thirty day period, or if Council affirms the finding of
the Building Nuisance Inspector and determines the building or structure
involved to be a public nuisance, Council shall order the Clerk to advertise
for bids for the demolition and removal of the building, dwelling or structure
in accordance with the law, unless the owner has repaired the same, in
accordance with the requirements of the Building Nuisance Inspector.
   (b)   In the event that Council is notified that the owner has appealed its
decision to a court having jurisdiction, the order to advertise for bids for
the demolition and removal of the building or structure shall be held in
abeyance until further order of such court.
(Ord. 1988-14. Passed 9-6-88.)
1325.07 CERTIFICATION OF COSTS.
   All charges, costs and expenses arising out of or connected with the
demolition or removal of any building, or structure pursuant to this chapter
shall be paid by the owner of the premises upon which any such building or
structure is situated, within ninety days after the demolition or removal
thereof as provided in this chapter and if not paid within such ninety day
period, it shall be certified to the Auditor of Preble County, at which time
the lien shall vest and the Auditor shall place the same on the tax duplicate

collected as other taxes.
(Ord. 1988-14. Passed 9-6-88.)
1325.08 NONLIABILITY.
   No officer, agent or employee of the Village shall render himself personally
liable for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of any
act required or permitted in the discharge of his duties under this chapter.

result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of his duties under
this chapter may be defended by the Law Director.
(Ord. 1988-14. Passed 9-6-88.)
1325.09 REPAIRS BY VILLAGE.
   In the discretion of the Building Nuisance Inspector, when demolition is not
needed to protect the public health, safety or welfare upon an owner's failure
to repair, and when boarding up the building, posting signs, or other less
stringent measures can be used to protect the public health, safety or welfare,
the Inspector is authorized to take such measures, in his discretion, short of
building demolition. Sections
1325.07 and
1325.08, supra, shall apply to these less stringent measures.

1333.11 ABATEMENT EXPENSES.
   The Village shall keep an itemized account of those expenses it incurs to
abate nuisances on behalf of a private property owner or tenant. The total cost
incurred for administration, labor, personnel, materials, and equipment may
either be collected through civil litigation directed against the property
owner or may be certified by the Village Clerk to the County Auditor, and by
the Auditor placed upon the tax duplicate to be a lien upon the duplicate and
to be collected as other taxes and returned to the Village, with the effect
that the total cost of the work constitutes a lien on the property which has
priority ahead of any and all mortgages on the premises. The collection
proceedings or certification to the Auditor shall only be initiated by the
Village after property owners, or others with an interest in the property, have
been offered at least thirty days to remit full payment for charges incurred.

CHAPTER 1337
Flood Damage Reduction
1337.01   General provisions.
1337.02   Definitions.
1337.03   Administration.
1337.04   Use and development standards for flood hazard reduction.
1337.05   Appeals and variances.
1337.06   Enforcement.
1337.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens.
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The Village of Lewisburg has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
       (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Lewisburg as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by the Village of Lewisburg.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Rate Map and Flood Insurance Study for Preble
County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both effective March 2, 2010.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Lewisburg as required by Section
1337.04(c) Subdivisions and Other New Developments.
    Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Village of Lewisburg, 112 South Commerce Street,
Lewisburg, Ohio 45338.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations are not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Lewisburg, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof,
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 2020-
04. Passed 6-4-20.)

limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading,
paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.
Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor
See "Lowest Floor."
Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)

assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified
special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
The agency with the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood
Insurance Program.
Fill
A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
 
Flood or Flooding
A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally
dry land areas from:
   1.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
   2.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any
source.
Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)
Usually the initial map, produced by the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency, or
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting
approximate special flood hazard areas.
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
An official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development has delineated the areas of special
flood hazard.
Flood Insurance Risk Zones
Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood
hazard in specific areas of a community. Following are the zone definitions:
   Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
base flood elevations are not determined.
   Zones Al-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
with flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
   Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet (usually areas of ponding); base
flood elevations are determined.
   Zone A99:

   Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
 
Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
The official report in which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has provided flood profiles,
floodway boundaries (sometimes shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and
the water surface elevations of the base flood.
Floodproofing
Any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or
adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate
or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their
contents.
Flood Protection Elevation
The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the base flood elevation plus two
[2] feet of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
Floodway
A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one (1) foot at any point within the
community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
Freeboard
A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the
purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many
unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height
calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic
effect of urbanization in a watershed.
Historic structure
Any structure that is:
   1.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of lnterior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
   2.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district; or
   3.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic places
maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
    4.   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained by
the Village of Lewisburg's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis
An analysis performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of
Ohio, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA,
used to determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
Letter of Map Change (LOMC)
A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend
or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the following
categories:
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
A comment by FEMA regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction,
affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and
thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the
effective base flood elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
Lowest floor
The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a
structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the lowest floor" which
is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area,
provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design
requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures below the lowest
floor.
Manufactured home
A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes of these
regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile homes
as defined in Chapter 4781 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Mean sea level
For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations
shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
Manufactured home park
As specified in the Ohio Adm. Code 4781-12-0l(K), a manufactured home park
means any tract of land upon which three (3) or more manufactured homes, used
for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and
includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three (3) or more manufactured homes
are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority. Manufactured home park does not include any tract of land used
solely for the storage or display for sale of manufactured homes.
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating
communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. This
insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster
assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and
their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an
agreement between local communities and the Federal government that states if a
community will adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce
future flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the
Federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as
a financial protection against flood loss.
New construction
Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by the Village of Lewisburg
on June 4, 2020 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the
"start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial
FIRM [March 2, 2010] , and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
Person
Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership,
association, or any other entity, including state and local governments and
agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code 111.15(A)(2) as
any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the general
assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or any
court.
 
Recreational vehicle
A vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less
when measured at the largest horizontal projection, (3) designed to be self-
propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and (4) designed
primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters
for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
Registered Professional Architect
A person registered to engage in the practice of architecture pursuant to Ohio
Revised Code 4703.01 and 4703.19.
Registered Professional Engineer
A person registered as a professional engineer pursuant to Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 4733.
Registered Professional Surveyor
A person registered as a professional surveyor pursuant to Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 4733.
Special Flood Hazard Area
Also known as "Areas of Special Flood Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al-30,
or A99. Special flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone
and designated from other federal state or local sources of data including but
not limited to historical flood information reflecting high water marks,
previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a
watercourse.
Start of construction
The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of a building.
Structure
A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally above ground.
 
Substantial Damage
Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
structure to the ' before damaged' condition would equal or exceed fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial Improvement
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
   1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   2.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration
would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
Variance
A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations.
Violation
The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with
these regulations.

         A.   Each federal agency has a responsibility to evaluate the
potential effects of any actions it may take in a floodplain; to ensure that
its planning programs and budget request reflect consideration of flood hazards
and floodplain management; and to prescribe procedures to implement the
policies and requirements of EO 11988.
   (k)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the Village of Lewisburg's flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section
1337.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six (6) months of the date
such information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
             2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed
structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special
flood hazard area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or other new development proposals requiring the

shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one (1) foot in riverine areas where FEMA has provided base flood
elevations but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (k)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Municipal Manager
of the Village of Lewisburg, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation / Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Lewisburg have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of Lewisburg' s Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the
Village of Lewisburg boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a
map of the Village of Lewisburg suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the
new corporate limits or the new area for which the Village of Lewisburg has
assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (l)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1337.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (4)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
   (m)   Use of Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map and/or Flood Insurance
Study Data.
      (1)   Zone A:
         A.   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from
the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall reasonably utilized as best available
data.
         B.   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final flood
elevation determination has been provided in a Letter of Final Determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
      (2)   Zones AE, Al -30, AH, and AO:
         A.   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
            1.   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
             2.   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not
be used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or
until all appeals have been resolved.
         B.   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section
1337.04(i)(2) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the
best data available.
      (3)   Zones B, C, and X:
         A.   Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIRM or FIS are
not required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the effective FIRM
which are being revised to Zone AE, Al-30, AH, or AO. Communities are
encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data to ensure that
the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
   (n)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one (1) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one (1) foot increase in the base flood elevation
may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one (1) foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation
why these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B.1. and 3. to 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the " bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Village of Lewisburg specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1337.03(k)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

Council of the Village of Lewisburg. Each member shall serve until his/her
successor is appointed.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board.
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the

the Village Clerk of Council, who shall act as the Secretary of the Appeals
Board for purposes of taking the meeting minutes and other record functions.
The records shall be retained at 112 South Commerce Street, Lewisburg, Ohio
45338.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within thirty [30] days of the date of such notice and
order, or other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such
hearing or for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the
Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by
the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of
the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.  
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
          Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A. to K. have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
       (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Preble County Court of Common Pleas,
pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Chapter 2506. (Ord. 2020-04. Passed 6-4-20.)
1337.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1337.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
subsection (c) hereof.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with subsection (c) hereof.

   (c)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a first degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
