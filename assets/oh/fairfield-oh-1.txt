EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the Codified Ordinances of Fairfield was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Fairfield Codified Ordinances is indicated.

revisions to the plan.

than two consecutive terms of office as a member of Council or the Mayor; nor
shall any person be elected to more than a total of two consecutive terms of
office as a member of Council and the Mayor in combination. For purposes of
applying this limitation on election to consecutive terms of office, election
to any other office or term as Mayor or member of Council before the expiration
of a current term to which the person was previously elected as Mayor or member
of Council shall constitute two consecutive terms of office. Any person who is
appointed to a different office or term during the first of possible
consecutive elected terms as Mayor or member of Council shall be limited to one
additional elected term as Mayor or member of Council when the additional
elected term immediately follows the expiration of either the elected or
appointed term. In addition, any person who has been elected to two consecutive
terms of office as defined above and whose most recent elected term has not
expired may only be appointed to serve in any other office or term as Mayor or
member of Council until the end of his or her most recent elected term. If
applicable, this limitation will operate as an automatic removal of the person
so appointed at the end of such person’s most recent elected term and create a
vacancy for any remaining balance of the term of the appointed office. Such
vacancy shall be filled as provided in either §3.10 or §5.03 of this Charter as
applicable. The provisions of §3.10 and §5.03 of this Charter relative to
appointments to vacancies for unexpired terms as Mayor or member of Council are
specifically limited as herein provided.

notary public, serve as a member or officer in the military reserve or national
guard, serve in any office, positions or capacity to further intergovernmental
cooperation, and may hold any office or position expressly permitted by this
Charter or the laws of Ohio. Elected officials and members of boards and
commissions shall not hold a position as an employee of the City during his or
her term of office. Additionally, candidates for the office of Mayor or member
of Council shall not hold a position as an employee of the City during the
period beginning on the date they file for office and continuing until after
the official results of the election have been certified by the election
authorities or, if elected, continuing until their term of office begins. A
member of Council shall not hold any compensated appointive office or
employment with the City until one year after he or she vacates the office of
Council member. The Mayor shall not hold any compensated appointive office or
employment with the City until one year after he or she vacates the office of

§11.03   REMOVAL OF ELECTED OFFICIALS AND MEMBERS OF BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS.
   (A)   Upon notice to the accused elected official or member of any board or
commission, and publication of the notice required by Division (D) of this
section, and after an opportunity has been given the accused person to be heard
and present defenses, the Council shall remove any elected official or member
of a board or commission for any of the following causes by a two-thirds vote

Council:

the causes permitting his or her removal shall not invalidate any action of the
Council, other elected official or board or commission, in which the official
participated. The subsequent removal of a person who fills a vacancy created
pursuant to this section, because of the reinstatement, by a court, of the
officer removed by the Council shall not invalidate any action of the Council,
other elected office, or board or commission in which such person who filled
the vacancy participated.
   (D)   The Council shall be the judge of the election and qualifications of
its members, other elected officials and members of boards and commissions, and
the grounds for removal from office, and for those purposes shall have the
power to subpoena witnesses, administer oaths and require the production of
evidence, either on its own motion or through the process of any appropriate
court or officer thereof. A person charged with conduct constituting grounds
for removal from office shall be entitled to a public hearing on demand, and
notice of such hearing shall be published in one or more newspapers of
circulation in the City at least one week in advance of the hearing. At such
hearing the Law Director, or other special counsel as designated by the
Council, shall present evidence and testimnony in support of the grounds
charged for removal. Such hearing may be adjourned from time to time without
the necessity of further publication of notice. Decisions made by the Council
under this section shall be subject to review by the Courts on matters of law
and whether the Council acted arbitrarily and without probative evidence to
support the grounds for removal.

liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;

designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action

(ORC 1.23)

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation. (ORC 1.52)
101.07   DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended. (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance. (ORC 1.49)
101.08   SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable. (ORC 1.50)
101.99   GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

143.03   RECUPERATIVE VACATION LEAVE.
   (a)   The City will grant to the members of the Police Department up to a
total of one year vacation leave with full pay after use of five days
accumulated sick leave for any disabling injury or illness which may be from
time to time incurred by such members while on active duty and which is
directly caused by conditions of employment and which occurred within the scope
of employment as a police officer. Aggravations or reoccurrences of an injury
shall not result in vacation leave in addition to the one year provided in this
section. This section shall not apply to police officers who are provided
recuperative vacation leave by contract.
   (b)   All police officers on vacation leave under this section shall also
apply for Workers' Compensation benefits. Gross payments by the City under this
section shall be reduced by the amount of any Workers' Compensation benefits or
disability insurance benefits received by such Police Department member which
arises from full or partial contributions made by the City. The City shall
continue to pay the officer's full salary until Workers' Compensation benefits
are received by the officer. The payments by the City will be adjusted for any
back award of Workers' Compensation benefits at the time such benefits are
received by the officer. The vacation leave shall commence from the expiration
of accumulated sick leave or the sixth day of the injury with the duration of
the vacation leave period being one year. Any officer who is on vacation leave
under this section for at least thirty days shall have his sick leave time
credited with the number of sick days used as a result of such injury or
illness before the commencement of vacation leave. In order to be eligible for
such vacation leave, it shall be necessary that the injured officer obtain a
certificate from a licensed physician, stating that such officer, because of
such injury, cannot perform the regular or ordinary duties of a police officer.
Such physician shall also provide a statement of the anticipated duration of
the disability. Upon request of the City, the officer shall submit to a
physical examination by a licensed physician selected by the City. If it is
determined by the City's physician or the officer's physician, that the officer
is permanently disabled so as to be unable to perform the regular or ordinary
duties of a police officer, then the officer shall promptly submit a proper
application for disability retirement to the Police Relief and Pension Fund.
The officer shall provide to the City copies of all correspondence and
documentation provided to the Police Relief and Pension Fund. The officer shall
also sign a release to enable the City to obtain information from the Police
Relief and Pension Fund regarding the status of his retirement application and/
or will assist the City in obtaining such information. The determination of
disability retirement eligibility by the Police Relief and Pension Fund shall
be binding upon the officer and the City. Any officer who is determined to be
eligible for disability retirement shall retire immediately. If the officer
applies for disability retirement under the Police Relief and Pension Fund, the
vacation leave shall continue until the final determination of disability
retirement eligibility.
   (c)   Officers on vacation leave under this section shall be entitled to
their normal vacation, personal days and uniform allowance unless they are on
vacation leave under this section for more than six continuous calendar months,
in which case the officers' vacation, personal days and uniform allowance shall
be reduced in proportion to the total period for which they were on vacation,
personal days and uniform allowance shall be reduced in proportion to the total
period for which they were on vacation leave under this section. (Example: If
an officer were on vacation leave under this section for seven continuous
months, his annual vacation, personal days and uniform allowance for the
calendar year in which his vacation leave under this section ended would be
reduced by seven twelfths (7/12).) In the further event that there is a basic
uniform change, i.e. not merely a seasonal uniform change, while an officer is
on vacation leave under this section, there shall be no proration of the
uniform allowance after six months and the officer shall receive his full
uniform allowance. The uniform allowance of an officer on vacation leave under
this section shall not be paid with the other officers' uniform allowance but
shall be paid upon the officer's return to active duty so as to allow the City
to prorate the uniform allowance payment if necessary. If an officer retires
without returning to active duty, no accrued uniform allowance or accrued
personal days will be paid. Officers on vacation leave under this section shall
not be entitled to any holiday pay, in addition to their normal pay.

(Ord. 99-05. Passed 5-9-05.)
163.18   OPERS PICK-UP.
   (a)   Salary Reduction Method.
      (1)   Effective March 11, 2024, the full amount of the statutorily
required employee contributions to the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System
(“OPERS”) shall be withheld from the gross pay of each full-time employee of
the City, who is a member of OPERS and shall be “picked up” (assumed and paid
to OPERS) by the City pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 414(h)(2). This
“pickup” by the City shall be designated as public employee contributions and
shall be in lieu of contributions to OPERS by each person as described in
subsection (a)(2) hereof. No person subject to this “pick up” shall have the
option of choosing to receive the statutorily required contribution to OPERS
directly instead of having it “picked up” by the City, or being excluded from
the “pick up”. The City, shall, in reporting and making remittance to OPERS,
report that the public employees contribution for each full time person subject
to the “pick up” has been made as provided by the statute. Therefore,
contributions, although designated as employee contributions, are employer-
paid, and employees do not have the option to receive the contributions
directly. All contributions are paid by the employer directly to the Plan.
      (2)   The “pick up” by the City, provided by this ordinance shall apply
to full time employees of the City, who are or become contributing members of
OPERS. The term “full time employee” as used herein is as defined in Section
163.001 of the Codified Ordinances of the City.
      (3)   The City’s method of payment of salary to employees who are
participant in OPERS is hereby modified as provided in subsection (a)(4) hereof
in order to provide for a salary reduction and the pick up of employee
contributions to OPERS.
      (4)   The total salary for each employee shall be the salary otherwise
payable under City policies. Such total salary of each employee shall be
payable by the City in two (2) parts: (i) deferred salary and (ii) cash salary.
An employee’
   (b)   Fringe Benefit Method.
      (1)   Effective March 11, 2024, five percent (5%) of the statutorily
required employee contributions to OPERS shall be picked up and paid as a
fringe benefit by the City for the City Manager only pursuant to Internal
Revenue Code Section 414(h)(2). The remaining five percent (5%) shall be
withheld from the City Manager per the salary reduction method as described in
subsection (a) hereof. The pick up shall be an offset against future salary
increases. This “pick up” by the City shall be designated as public employee
contributions and shall be in lieu of contributions to OPERS by the City
Manager. No person subject to this “pick up” shall have the option of choosing
to receive the statutorily required contribution to OPERS directly instead of
having it “picked up” by the City or being excluded from the “pick up”. The
City shall, in reporting and making remittance to OPERS, report that the public
employees contribution for the City Manager subject to the “pick up” has been
made as provided by the statute. Therefore, contributions, although designated
as employee contributions, are employer-paid, and the City Manager does not
have the option to receive the contributions directly. All Contributions are
paid by the employer directly to the Plan.
      (2)   Under the fringe-benefit method of employer pick up, salary is not
modified; however, the employer will pay five percent (5%) of the City
Manager’s statutorily required contribution to OPERS.
      (3)   The Finance Director and/or Payroll Administrator are hereby
authorized and directed to implement the provisions of this section to

168.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDING.
   It is hereby found and determined by the Council of the City of Fairfield, a
charter governed home rule Municipality of the State of Ohio, that there exist
within the City blighted and deteriorating areas of the nature defined in this
chapter which constitute a serious and growing menace injurious and inimical to
the public health, safety, morals, economic well- being and general welfare of
the residents thereof and of the entire City of Fairfield and its citizens;
that the existence of such areas:
   (a)   Substantially impairs and arrests the sound growth of the community by
causing the obsolescence of urban neighborhoods and facilities, and by impeding
and retarding the sound private development of property and creation and
preservation of housing and employment opportunities; that both properties
improved with structures and vacant properties contribute to the above
conditions; that this menace is beyond remedy and control solely by regulatory
processes and exercise of the police power, and cannot be dealt with
effectively by the ordinary operation of private enterprise without the aids
herein provided; that the elimination by the City, in whole or in part, of
blighted and deteriorating areas by urban renewal as defined herein is
necessary for the public welfare and is a public use and purpose for which
public money may be expended and private property acquired through negotiation
or the exercise of the power of eminent domain;
   (b)   Constitutes an economic and social liability;
   (c)   Substantially increases the risk of the spread of disease, economic
decay and crime, and of losses by fire and accident, necessitating excessive
and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for the preservation of the
public health and safety, for crime prevention, correction, prosecution and
punishment, for the treatment of juvenile delinquency, for the maintenance of
adequate police, fire and accident protection and for other public services and
facilities; and
   (d)   In many instances requires for the public welfare the acquisition by
the City of properties which do and which do not contribute to the
qualification of the areas blighted.
      (Ord. 195-99. Passed 10-25-99; Ord. 217-99. Passed 12-13-99.)

168.10 ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY; REHABILITATION; SITE PREPARATION AND PROJECT
IMPROVEMENTS.
   Within a blighted area, where the acquisition of real property is reasonably
necessary in order to carry out the urban renewal plan, the City Manager is
hereby authorized to undertake such acquisition by negotiation or by eminent
domain litigation even on parcels which may not have been individually found to
contribute to the area's blight. Within a deteriorating area, such acquisition
shall be limited to those parcels which have been individually found to
contribute to the area's deterioration. The acquisition authorization set forth
in this section shall in no respect limit the City's authority to acquire real
property for public purposes other than the elimination of blight or blighting
influences. The City Manager is hereby authorized in blighted or deteriorating
areas to rehabilitate property, demolish the buildings and do other site
preparation work on property acquired by the City, to cause such studies, plans
and surveys to be made by force account or by contract which are necessary and
proper to carry out the project improvements in accordance with the urban
renewal plan or in accordance with Council-approved design plans, to do all
things necessary or appropriate to carry out the acquisition of property,
redevelopment, rehabilitation, demolition of buildings, to provide studies,
plans or surveys for project improvements, and to provide, if necessary, the
services of architects and home management specialists to residents or
businesses in the area.
   Where the City Manager determines appropriation is necessary, the City
Manager shall cause to be submitted such legislation to Council as is necessary
to conform to the laws of Ohio to effect such appropriation.

168.11 CONFORMING AGREEMENTS.
   If the owner of property in an urban renewal area is willing to make the use
of such property conform to the urban renewal plan and the City Manager is of
the opinion that the acquisition of the owner's property will not be necessary
to carry out the urban renewal plan if the owner makes the property conform to
the urban renewal plan, then in such case the City Manager, in lieu of
acquiring such property may, on behalf of the City, enter into an agreement
with such owner in which the owner agrees to conform the land, the structures
thereon and the use thereof to the urban renewal plan within the time set forth
in the agreement. The City Manager may require as a condition to entering into
such agreement that the owner furnish such security for the performance of
obligations under such agreement as the City Manager believes is necessary in
order to protect the interest of the City.

urban renewal plan. Such petition shall be in writing and shall state in detail
the modification desired. Upon receipt of such petition, Council shall refer it
to the City Planning Commission for its recommendation. The City Planning
Commission shall either approve or disapprove the modification and return the
petition to Council, together with its recommendation.
In the event the proposed modification contemplates an expansion of the urban
renewal or project area, documentation shall be prepared giving evidence that
at the time of the proposed modification either:
   (a)   The area which comprises the addition to the existing urban renewal or
project area qualifies as a blighted or deteriorating area; or
   (b)   The entire urban renewal or project area including the proposed
additional area qualifies as a blighted or deteriorating area.
   In the event the proposed modification contemplates an alteration of the
urban renewal or project area boundaries, additional public acquisition of
property, or a change in zoning within the area, Council shall, before
considering it, hold a public hearing thereon, at which an opportunity shall be
provided for all persons interested to be heard, either in person or by
counsel. Notice of such hearing shall be given in the manner prescribed in
Section
168.07 of this chapter. Council may either approve or reject the proposed
modification by a majority vote unless the Planning Commission has failed to
approve the plan, in which case it may be approved by a vote of not less than
two-thirds of the members of Council. If the proposed modification is adopted
by Council, it shall become a part of the urban renewal plan.
(Ord. 195-99. Passed 10-25-99; Ord. 217-99. Passed 12-13-99.)
168.13 DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY.

standard that is not applicable to all persons or families irrespective of
race, religion or ancestry.
(Ord. 195-99. Passed 10-25-99; Ord. 217-99. Passed 12-13-99.)

steps to secure financing of urban renewal programs, including federal or state

payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.

for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal

employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)   Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages

one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the

            (i)   The nature of the services are such that it will require more
than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in section 181.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section 181.03 of this Chapter. To determine
whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable year, a Tax
Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax Administrator with
the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
   (F)   Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
181.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

providing the name, address, and social security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of
the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino
gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the

deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be

rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is

the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video

following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amount deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable

181.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net

Section 181.03(34).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section 181.03

5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (B) and (J) of this section,
net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section 181.052 of this
Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a fairer apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
181.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section 181.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:

under the possession of one of the following:

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the

division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals made and

      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (F)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (G)   (1)   Except as provided in division (G)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section 181.081 of this Chapter.
   (H)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (18)(L) and (49)(A)(iv) of Section 181.03 of this
Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has apportioned a
portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt
from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to that
municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its
net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount other
than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the
amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (I)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (J)   (1)   As used in this division:
         (a)   “Qualifying remote employee or owner” means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)   “Qualifying remote work location” means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
“Qualifying remote work location” may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter, an employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)   “Reporting location” means either of the following:
            (i)   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer.
            (ii)   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer
or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under Section D of this chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee
for the performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)   “Qualifying reporting location” means one of the following:
            (i)   The reporting location in this state as which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)   If no reporting location exists in this State for an
employee or owner under division (J)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this State at which the employee’s or owner’s supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year.
            (iii)   If no reporting location exists in this State for an
employee or owner under division (J)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee’s or owner’s
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer’s business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of Section 181.062 apply to such apportionment except as
otherwise provided in this division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer’s net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the Tax Administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
Tax Administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee’s or owner’s qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee’s or
owner’s activity at the qualifying remote work location.
   After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee’s or owner’s qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.
Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under
this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (A)
of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (J)(2):
         (a)   For the purpose of division (A)(1) of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual’s qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual’s qualifying reporting location.
         (b)   For the purpose of division (A)(2) of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual’s qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual’s qualifying reporting
location.
         (c)   For the purpose of division (A)(3) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (D) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual’s
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual’s
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
Tax Administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (B) of this section. However, a Tax Administrator shall
not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it would
require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee’s or owner’s qualifying remote work
location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section 181.51 of this chapter.

Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated

(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to

         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.

binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   For tax years beginning on and after January 1, 2018, when a
taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of the Revised Code, a
valid election made by the taxpayer under division (B)(1) or (2) of this
section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of the five-year
period.
      (5)   For tax years beginning on and after January 1, 2018, when an
election made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code is terminated, a valid
election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code is binding upon the Tax
Administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
181.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of Section
181.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section 181.062 of this Chapter,
exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in
the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section 181.062 of this Chapter,
include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in
the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section 181.062 of this
Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section 181.062 of this Chapter by
substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to" for "net
profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may

estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for a municipal corporation's
income tax for the current taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to a municipal
corporation for the taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the

taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the purposes of this
section:
      (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid to
the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts on
each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts
were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as paid on the
dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (c)   Taxes withheld by a casino operator or by a lottery sales agent
under section 718.031 of the Ohio Revised Code are deemed to be paid to the
municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld on the date the taxes

filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of estimated taxes. A
taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the tax
administrator. Except as provided in division (F) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the tax administrator.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 181.091 of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the
fourth month after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be

provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent of the tax liability for the

individual, on or before the fifteenth day of the first month of the following
taxable year, ninety percent of the tax liability for the taxable year. For a
person other than an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth
month of the taxable year, ninety percent of the tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section 181.091 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section 181.10 of
this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment,
unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E)
of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:

and one-half percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven

      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section 181.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

181.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
181.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (A)   Limitation. Where a Resident of Fairfield is subject to a municipal
income tax in another Municipality he shall not pay a total municipal income
tax on the same income greater than the tax imposed at the higher rate. Credit
is not given to School or County tax paid.
   (B)   Credits to Residents. Resident individuals of Fairfield who are
required to pay and do pay, a tax to another municipality on salaries, wages,
commissions or other compensation for work done or services performed in such
other municipality, or a Net Profits from Businesses, professions or other
activities conducted in such other municipality, may claim a credit of the
amount of tax paid by them or on their behalf for the same taxable period to
such other municipality but only to the extent of the tax imposed by this
chapter on such compensation or Net Profits.
   (C)   Method of Applying for Credit. No credit will be given unless the
Taxpayer claims such on his final return or other form prescribed by the Tax
Administrator, and presents such evidence of the payment of a similar tax to
only another municipality, as the Tax Administrator may require.
      (1)   Tax credit for taxes paid to another City is limited to the income
determined to be taxable by the Tax Administrator or designee. The credit
allowed is limited to the income taxed by another City. The credit allowed for
taxes paid to another Municipality whose rate is higher than Fairfield's rate
is calculated by dividing the tax withheld by that City's tax rate and
multiplying that income by the tax rate imposed by this chapter. A taxpayer who
pays a tax to a City whose rate is less than the tax rate imposed by this
chapter shall only receive credit for the tax paid. No excess tax withheld for
a Municipality whose rate is higher than Fairfield's rate shall apply to income
taxed by another Municipality whose rate is lower than Fairfield's rate.
      (2)   Tax credit for taxes paid by a resident on his net profits shall be
limited to the income determined to be taxable by the Tax Administrator or
designee. If the taxpayer pays directly to another Municipality for his
unincorporated entity but has additional unincorporated entities sustaining
losses, the tax credit allowed will be reduced to the net taxable income
recognized by the City. No taxes paid to another Municipality will be credited
or refunded or applied to other income of the taxpayer.
      (3)   A refund must be claimed by the taxpayer or his employer within
three (3) years of the date of filing the final return for the year for which
such refund is claimed. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe rules for
verification.
   A statement satisfactory to the Tax Administrator from the taxing authority
of the Municipality to which the taxes are paid that a Fairfield Resident or
his Employer is paying the tax shall be considered as fulfilling the
requirement of this article.
(Ord. 107-20. Passed 12-7-20.)
181.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 107-20. Passed 12-7-20.)
181.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.

under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
181.081 of this Chapter.

division of the tax imposed on the qualifying wages, commissions, other

   181.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, if tax or
withholding is paid to a municipal corporation on income or wages, and if the
City imposes or assesses a tax on that income or wages after the time period
allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipal
corporation, the City shall allow a nonrefundable credit, against the tax or
withholding the City claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal
to the tax or withholding paid to the other municipal corporation with respect
to such income or wages.
   (B)   If the tax rate in the City is less than the tax rate in the other
municipal corporation, then the credit described in division (A) of this
section shall be calculated using the tax rate in effect in the City.
   (C)   If the tax rate in the City is greater than the tax rate in the other
municipal corporation, the tax due in excess of the credit afforded is to be
paid to the City, along with any penalty and interest accruing thereto during
the period of nonpayment.
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.

the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section 181.092 of this Chapter

before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that date by United States Mail to the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official with which the report, claim, statement, or other document is required
to be filed, or to which the payment is required to be made, the date of the

payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.

generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,

         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.

the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (E)   If the Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for filing
state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Ohio

Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the

reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the

federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section 181.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division

computations, or attachments that are not affected, either directly or

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section 181.18 of this
Chapter.
   (C)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
181.10 of this Chapter.
   (E)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in

an audit, the Tax Administrator shall inform the taxpayer when the audit is

181.13 AUTHORITY AND POWERS OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
181.131 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS OF THE TAX
ADMINISTRATOR.
   There is hereby created a subdepartment within the Finance Department to be
entitled the Fairfield Income Tax Division for the administration of the
provisions of this chapter. Such Division shall consist of a Tax Administrator,
Deputy Tax Administrator and such clerical and secretarial personnel as may be
determined to be necessary for the administration of this chapter, all of whom
shall be appointed as provided for in the City Charter. The Tax Administrator
has the authority to perform all duties and functions necessary and appropriate
to implement the provisions of this Chapter, including without limitation:
   (A)   Exercise all powers whatsoever of an inquisitorial nature as provided
by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records, memorandums,
and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under oath, to
issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths; provided that the powers
referred to in this division of this section shall be exercised by the Tax
Administrator only in connection with the performance of the duties
respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under a municipal corporation
income tax ordinance or resolution adopted in accordance with this chapter;
   (B)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
   (C)   Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and
states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;
   (D)   Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax
Administrator's findings, and, if the Tax Administrator finds that there has
been an overpayment, approve and issue a refund payable to the taxpayer, the
taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as provided in this chapter;
   (E)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to the
compromise and settlement of tax claims;
   (F)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to the use of
alternative apportionment methods by taxpayers in accordance with Section
181.062 of this Chapter;
   (G)   Make all tax findings, determinations, computations, assessments and
orders the Tax Administrator is by law authorized and required to make and,
pursuant to time limitations provided by law, on the Tax Administrator's own
motion, review, redetermine, or correct any tax findings, determinations,
computations, assessments or orders the Tax Administrator has made, but the Tax
Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,
determination, computation, assessment or order which the Tax Administrator has
made for which an appeal has been filed with the Local Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (H) Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
   (I)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in Section 181.051 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 107-20. Passed 12-7-20.)
181.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action is
in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim, by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)   The tax administrator may consider the following standards when
ascertaining with respect to a claim whether a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement is in the best interest of the Municipality:
      (1)   There exists a doubt as to whether the claim can be collected.
      (2)   There exists a substantial probability that, upon payment of the
claim and submission of a timely request for refund with respect to that
payment, the tax administrator would refund an amount that was illegally or
erroneously paid.
      (3)   There exists an economic hardship such that a compromise or
agreement would facilitate effective tax administration.
      (4)   There exists a joint liability among spouses, one of whom is an
innocent spouse, provided that any relief under this standard shall only affect
the claim as to the innocent spouse. A spouse granted relief under section 6015
of the Internal Revenue Code with regard to any income item is rebuttably
presumed to be an innocent spouse with regard to that income item to the extent
that income item is included in or otherwise affects computation of a municipal
income tax or any penalty or interest on that tax.
      (5)   Any other reasonable standard that the tax administrator
establishes.
   (D)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (F)   (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be imposed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (G)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement. (Ord. 107-20. Passed
12-7-20.)
181.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 107-20. Passed 12-7-20.)
181.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section 181.10 of this Chapter, in
addition to any applicable penalty described in Section 181.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section 181.10 of this
Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section 181.99 of this Chapter
for a violation of Section 181.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that
may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 107-20. Passed 12-7-20.)
181.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 107-20. Passed 12-7-20.)
181.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or

Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax

Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant

181.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the

of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.

alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be

the postal service or an authorized delivery service under section 5703.056 of
the Revised Code. If, after using reasonable means, the tax administrator is
unable to ascertain a new last known address, the assessment shall be sent by
ordinary mail and considered served. If the ordinary mail is subsequently
returned because of an undeliverable address, the assessment remains appealable
within sixty days after the assessment's postmark.
         (b)   Once the tax administrator or other municipal official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within sixty days after the receipt
of service. The delivery of an assessment of the tax administrator under
division (B)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is
complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a tax administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the tax
administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the tax administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the tax administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the tax administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the tax administrator shall proceed under division (B)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (C) of this section.
   (C)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
   (D)   Nothing in this section prohibits the tax administrator or the tax
administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a tax administrator
by personal service.
   (E)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be stayed upon the pendency of an
appeal under this section. If an appeal is filed pursuant to this section on a
claim that has been delivered for collection, the collection activities with
respect to the assessment shall be stayed.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the tax administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
tax administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under section 5703.056 of the Revised Code.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under section 5703.056 of the Revised
Code is not able to deliver an assessment of the tax administrator, except when
the reason for nondelivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or
accept the assessment.
         (Ord. 107-20. Passed 12-7-20.)
181.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.

      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section

qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign

      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment regarding an
underpayment of municipal income tax or denies a refund claim, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment or denial, the manner in which the
taxpayer may appeal the assessment or denial, and the address to which the
appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board created pursuant to this section by filing a request with the
board. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why
the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within sixty days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, which may include a schedule of costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. Such records are not public
records available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code.
The procedural rules governing the Local Board of Tax Review shall be in
writing, and may be amended as needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.
Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created
pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section
121.22 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 107-20. Passed 12-7-20.)
181.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section 181.18
of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision,
finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the Local Board of
Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have
jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that
assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section 181.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
       (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section 181.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any
court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed,
so that the amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment
is less than the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the
appellant's assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the
overpayment as provided by Section 181.096 of this Chapter, with interest on
that amount as provided by division (D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other

(Ord. 107-20. Passed 12-7-20.)
181.25 NET-PROFIT OPT IN FOR FILING THROUGH THE STATE OF OHIO DEPARTMENT OF
TAXATION.
   This section applies to any taxpayer, not an individual, engaged in a
business or profession in the Municipality and electing to be subject to
Sections 718.80 through 718.95 of the Ohio Revised Code, applicable for tax
years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, pursuant to the language enacted
by the Ohio Legislature during the 132nd General Assembly in the form of Am.
Sub House Bill 49, which required municipal corporations to conform to and
adopt the provisions of Ohio Revised Code Chapter 718 in order to retain the
authority to impose, enforce, administer and collect a municipal income tax.
   (A)   Effective with taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 a
taxpayer may elect to be subject to sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised
Code in lieu of the provisions set forth in this chapter. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this chapter, upon the taxpayer's election, both of the
following shall apply:
      (1)   The tax commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator of each
municipal income tax for which the taxpayer is liable for the term of the
election;
      (2)   The tax commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to sections
718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code and any applicable provision of Chapter
5703 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)   A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the tax commissioner and each municipal corporation in which the
taxpayer conducted business during the previous taxable year, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
      (2)   A.   The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the
taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the tax commissioner and each municipal corporation
in which the taxpayer conducted business during the previous taxable year of
its termination of the election.
         (A)   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (B)   Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the
taxpayer is no longer subject to sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code,
and is instead subject to the provisions set forth in the remainder of this
chapter.
   (C)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by sections 718.80 to 718.95
of the Revised Code is confidential, and no person shall disclose such
information, except for official purposes, in accordance with a proper judicial
order, or as provided in section 4123.271 or 5703.21 of the Revised Code. The
tax commissioner may furnish the Internal Revenue Service with copies of
returns filed. This section does not prohibit the publication of statistics in
a form which does not disclose information with respect to particular
taxpayers.
   (D)   For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual return.
Such return, along with the amount of tax shown to be due on the return less
the amount paid for the taxable year under section 718.88 of the Revised Code,
shall be submitted to the tax commissioner, on a form and in the manner
prescribed by the commissioner, on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth
month following the end of the taxpayer's taxable year.
   (E)   All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under section 718.80
of the Revised Code shall file any tax return or extension for filing a tax
return, and shall make payment of amounts shown to be due on such returns,
electronically, either through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner
as prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (F)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section 718.80
of the Revised Code fails to pay any tax as required under sections 718.80 to
718.95 of the Revised Code, or any portion of that tax, on or before the date
prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in
the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date prescribed for
its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is issued under
section 718.90 of the Revised Code, whichever occurs first.
   (G)   A. A credit, granted by resolution or ordinance of a municipal
corporation pursuant to section 718.15 or 718.151 of the Revised Code, shall be
available to a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section 718.80
of the Revised Code, against the municipal corporation's tax on income.
   (H)   (1)   Each taxpayer that claims a credit shall submit, with the
taxpayer's tax return, documentation issued by the municipal corporation
granting the credit that confirms the eligibility of the taxpayer for the
credit, the amount of the credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the
tax year to which the credit is to be applied.
      (2)   Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by a municipal corporation and taxpayer under section 718.15 or 718.151 of
the Revised Code, or to modify the terms or conditions of any such existing
agreement.
         (Ord. 107-20. Passed 12-7-20.)

183.01   PURPOSE.
   Recognizing the continual need for recreational facilities within the City
and conforming this need to the growth of population and increase in the number
of residential units within the City, it shall be the purpose of this chapter
to provide, together with moneys derived from other Municipal funds, for the
orderly acquisition, development, maintenance and operation of publicly owned
recreation sites and facilities, including, but not limited to, park sites,
area recreational facilities and community recreation centers within the City
by creating a tax to be charged on all residential units and mobile home or
trailer pads hereinafter constructed or installed.
(Ord. 19-72. Passed 3-13-72.)
183.02   ESTABLISHED.
   (a)   From and after the effective date of this chapter there is hereby
created a tax to be paid concurrently with the obtaining of a building permit
for a residential unit or with the issuance of a permit for the installation of
trailer or mobile home pads or at the installation of any manufactured
residential unit where such units do not require a building permit, as follows:
 
For each single or multiple family residential unit (including $150.00
manufactured residential units)
For each trailer or mobile home pad                            150.00
(Ord. 31-90. Passed 2-26-90.)
   (b)   For the purposes of this chapter "residential unit" means each unit
designed and intended to be occupied by one family. (Ord. 19-72. Passed 3-13-
72.)
183.03   USE OF TAX.
   All such taxes shall be used for the acquisition, development, maintenance
and operation of publicly owned recreation sites and facilities including, but
not limited to, park sites, area recreational facilities and community
recreation centers within the City. (Ord. 19-72. Passed 3-13-72.)
183.04   RECREATION TAX FUND.
   All tax money collected under this chapter shall be placed in a separate
fund to be entitled Recreation Tax Fund. (Ord. 19-72. Passed 3-13-72.)
183.05   APPROPRIATION OF OTHER FUNDS.
   During the period of time that the tax levied by this chapter is collected,
Council shall appropriate annually from other Municipal tax sources a sum not
less than equal to the tax moneys derived from this chapter for park and
recreational purposes which may include funds appropriated for park and
recreation capital improvements. The Finance Director is directed to create a
Recreation Tax Fund and is further directed at the close of each year that the
recreation tax herein is collected, to transfer to the Recreation Tax Fund from
General Fund moneys a sum of money equal to the amount of money collected from
the recreation tax after first deducting expenditures during the tax year for
park and recreation purposes from the .2% Capital Improvement Fund or any other
park and recreation expenditures made from General Fund money. It is the
intention of Council that during each year that the recreation tax is in force
that an amount equal to the tax moneys received from the recreation tax shall
be irrevocably committed to park and recreation purposes from other Municipal
tax sources of the City.

transient guest fails to pay the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter on
any transaction subject to the tax, such vendor or transient guest shall be
personally liable for the amount of the tax applicable to the transaction. The

transient guest assessed written notice of such assessment. Such notice may be
served upon the vendor or transient guest personally or by registered or
certified mail. An assessment issued against either pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter shall not be considered an election of remedies, nor a bar to
an assessment against the other for the tax applicable to the same transaction,
provided that no assessment shall be issued against any vendor or transient
guest for the tax due on a particular transaction if said tax has actually been
paid by another.
   (c)   The Director of Finance may make an assessment against any vendor who
fails to file a return required by this chapter or fails to remit the proper
amount for the tax in accordance with this chapter. When information in the
possession of the Director of Finance indicates that the amount required to be
collected is, or should be, greater than the amount remitted by the vendor, the
Director of Finance may, upon the basis of test checks of a vendor's business
for a representative period, which are hereby authorized, determined the ratio
which the tax required to be collected under this chapter bears to the hotel's
or transient accommodations' lodging which determination shall be the basis of
an assessment as herein provided in this chapter. Notice of such assessment
shall be made in the manner prescribed in this chapter.
   (d)   Unless the vendor or transient guest, to whom said notice of
assessment is directed, files within thirty (30) days after service thereof,
either personally or by registered or certified mail a petition, in writing,
verified under oath by said vendor, transient guest, or his authorized agent,
having knowledge of the facts, setting forth with particularity the items of
said assessment objected to, together with the reasons for such objections,
said assessment shall become conclusive and the amount thereof shall be due and
payable, from the vendor or transient guest so assessed, to the Director of
Finance. When a petition for reassessment is filed, the Director of Finance
shall assign a time and place for the hearing of same and shall notify the
petitioner thereof by registered or certified mail, but the Director of Finance
may continue the hearings from time to time if necessary.
   (e)   A penalty of ten percent (10%) shall be added to the amount of every
assessment made under this chapter. The Director of Finance may adopt and
promulgate rules and regulations providing for the remission of penalties added
to assessments made under this chapter.
   (f)   When any vendor or transient guest files a petition for reassessment
as provided in this chapter, the assessment made by the Finance Director,
together with penalties thereon, shall become due and payable within three (3)
days after notice of the finding made at the hearing has been served, either
personally or by registered or certified mail, upon the party assessed.
(Ord. 49-07. Passed 4-9-07.)
187.08 LIMITATION FOR ASSESSMENTS.

for any tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter more than four (4) years
after the return date for the period in which the lodging was furnished, or
more than four (4) years after the return for such period is filed, whichever
is later. This section does not bar an assessment:
   (a)   When the Director of Finance has substantial evidence of amounts of
taxes collected by a vendor from transient guest's lodging that were not
returned to the city.
   (b)   When the vendor assessed failed to file a return as required.
   (c)   When the Director of Finance and the vendor or guest waives the
limitation in writing.
(Ord. 49-07. Passed 4-9-07.)

Chapter. No vendor shall refund, remit or rebate to a transient guest, either
directly or indirectly any of the tax levied pursuant to this Chapter, or make

imply that he is absorbing the tax, or paying the tax for the transient guest
by an adjustment of prices, or furnishing lodging at a price including the tax,
or rebating the tax in any other manner.
(Ord. 49-07. Passed 4-9-07.)

corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed

fraudulent return, report or statement.
   (b)   If any vendor required to file returns under this chapter fails on two
consecutive quarters to file such returns when due or to pay the tax thereon,
or if any other vendor authorized by the Finance Director to file returns at
less frequent intervals, fails on two or more occasions within a twenty-four
month period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax due thereon, the
Finance Director may: require such vendor to furnish security in an amount
equal to the average tax liability of the vendor for a period of one year, as
determined by the Finance Director from a review of returns or other
information pertaining to such vendor, which amount shall in no event be less
than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The security may be in the form of a
payment to be applied to pay the tax due on subsequent returns, or a corporate
surety bond, satisfactory to the Finance Director, conditioned upon payment of
the tax due with the returns from the vendor. The security must be filed within
ten days following the vendor’s receipt of the notice from the Finance Director
of its requirements.
   (c)   A corporate surety bond filed under this section shall be returned to
the vendor if, for a period of twelve consecutive months following the date the
bond was filed, the vendor has filed all returns and remitted payment therewith
within the time prescribed in this chapter.

the City under the provisions of the chapter, fails for any reasons to make
such filing or payment, and of its officers or employees charged with the
responsibility of filing returns and making payments shall be personally liable
for such failure. The dissolution of a corporation shall not discharge an
officer or employee’s liability for a prior failure of the corporation to file
returns or remit tax due. The sum due for such liability may be collected by
assessment in the manner provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 49-07. Passed 4-9-07.)

other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee
may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it has
been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.
      (3)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (4)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written

of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due

Ohio R.C. 4513.611.
      (4)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by

303.083 IMPOUNDING VEHICLES ON PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway
patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer without notification to
the chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However,
when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall
allow the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the
removal of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief, or
state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
subsection (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle
by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the
owner retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or
storage facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69
(B)(3), if applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in addition
to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(ORC 4513.61; Ord. 91-24. Passed 8-12-24.)
303.09   LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. (ORC
4513.64; Ord. 91-24. Passed 8-12-24.)
303.10   LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.

discretion require that person to perform supervised community service work
under authority of the City in lieu of imprisonment or the payment of a fine or

others.
      (2)   The offense was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur.

unlikely to commit the same or a similar Traffic Code violation.
      (5)   Imprisonment of the offender will entail undue hardship to himself

   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which

guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety

violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

(ORC 4511.12; Ord. 120-18. Passed 11-26-18.)
313.02   THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
313.03   TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section. (Ord. 103-12. Passed 11-26-12.)
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
            (Ord. 1-14. Passed 1-13-14.)
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of- way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not

use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.

conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.

admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
               The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term

offender under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and
requires the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers'
intervention program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
               The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the
three-day jail term under this subsection if it places the offender under a
community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three
days, requires the offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a
drivers' intervention program so certified, and sentences the offender to a
jail term equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days that the
offender does not spend attending the program. The court may require the
offender, as a condition of community control and in addition to the required
attendance at a drivers' intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily
complete any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum
standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental
Health and Addiction Services that the operators of the drivers' intervention
program determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to
the court on the offender's progress in the programs. The court also may impose
on the offender any other conditions of community control that it considers
necessary.
               If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time
offender under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by

except that the court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term
imposed by the court under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting
unlimited driving privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers' intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers' intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers' intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers' intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
               If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time
offender under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by
the court under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply,
except that the court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term
imposed by the court under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting
unlimited driving privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

sanction imposed under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete
any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum standards
adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 3793 by the Director of Alcohol and Drug
Addiction Services, in addition to the required attendance at drivers'
intervention program, that the operators of the drivers' intervention program
determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to the
court on the offender's progress in the programs. The court also may impose any
other conditions of community control on the offender that it considers
necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this

this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day

monitoring and jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed
by a community addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C.
5119.21, subject to subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the
offender to follow the treatment recommendations of the services provider. The
purpose of the assessment is to determine the degree of the offender's alcohol

of the court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment
to the court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses
related to alcohol use.

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public

license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle. (Ord. 145-09.

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case.
   If the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded guilty to any
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the

license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.

religious event provided the holder of a probationary driver’s license with the
written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.
The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall make available at no cost a form to serve
as the written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section,

over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months
or the date the holder attains the age of seventeen years, whichever occurs

holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted. If a person is convicted of, pleads
guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a second or

asrequired by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a
ticket, citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or
is being violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of
a person for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license

addition to or independent of any other sentence that it imposes upon the
offender, may order the immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense
for thirty days and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license plates for thirty

   (a)   For purposes of enforcement of parking prohibitions, the Chief of
Police is authorized to create parking tickets in such form as he may determine
which shall be used by City law enforcement officers for the purpose of giving
notice to owners and operators of vehicles found parked in violation of
provisions of this Traffic Code or the Ohio Revised Code pertaining to the
illegal parking of vehicles. Any owner or operator, when a parking ticket is
attached to the vehicle which has been illegally parked shall appear at the

testimony that a vehicle bearing a certain license plate, or vehicle
identification number (VIN) if no license plate is displayed was found
unlawfully parked as prohibited by the provisions of this Traffic Code or the
Ohio Revised Code pertaining to the parking of vehicles, and further testimony
that the record of the Ohio Registrar of Motor Vehicles shows that the license
plate or VIN was issued to the defendant, shall be prima-facie evidence that
the vehicle which was unlawfully parked, was so parked by the defendant. A
record provided by the registrar through the Ohio Law Enforcement Automated

contains. If the operator of the vehicle is present, the officer shall record
on the parking ticket the name of the operator in a space provided on the
parking ticket for identification of the violator, and shall personally serve
the parking ticket upon the violator. If the operator of the vehicle is not
present, the officer shall insert the registered owner’s name and address in
the space provided on the parking ticket for identification of the owner, then
shall affix the parking ticket to the vehicle in a conspicuous place, which
shall constitute service of the parking ticket upon the owner.

previous conviction of or plea of guilty to a violation of a section of the
Codified Ordinances or Ohio Revised Code or of a division of a section of the
Codified Ordinances or Ohio Revised Code shall be construed to also refer to a
previous conviction of or plea of guilty to a substantially equivalent offense
under an existing or former law of this State, another state, or the United
States or under an existing or former municipal ordinance.
   (d)   Any provision of the Codified Ordinances that refers to a section, or
to a division of a section, of the Codified Ordinances that defines or
specifies a criminal offense shall be construed to also refer to an existing or
former law of this State, another state, or the United States, to an existing
or former municipal ordinance, or to an existing or former division of any such
existing or former law or ordinance that defines or specifies, or that defined
or specified, a substantially equivalent offense.
(ORC 2901.04; Ord. 87-05. Passed 5-9-05.)
501.05   CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (a)   A person is subject to misdemeanor prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this Municipality.
      (6)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another and subsequently brings the other person into this
Municipality.
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01.
(Ord. 133-06. Passed 10-23-06.)
501.06   LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section 525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs: (Ord. 101-16. Passed 12-5-16.)
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
(Ord. 157-08. Passed 12-8-08.)
501.07   REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section 501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21; Ord. 99-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
501.08   CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22; Ord. 99-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
501.09   ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02; Ord. 65-01. Passed 5-14-01.)
501.10   COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09. (A.O.)
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
(Ord. 38-88. Passed 2-22-88.)
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11   ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(Ord. 103-12. Passed 11-26-12.)
501.12   PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
501.13   DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY.
   (a)   Any property, other than contraband that is subject to the provisions
of Ohio R.C. 2933.43 and other than property that has been lawfully seized in
relation to a violation of Ohio R.C. 2933.42, that has been lost, abandoned,
stolen, seized pursuant to a search warrant, or otherwise lawfully seized or
forfeited, and that is in the custody of the Police Department, shall be kept
safely pending the time it no longer is needed as evidence, and shall be
disposed of pursuant to this section. The Police Department shall maintain an
accurate record of any lost, abandoned, stolen, seized or forfeited property in
its custody. The record shall include the manner in which it was disposed of,
the date of its disposition and the name of the person who received the
property if it was not destroyed. The record of any property that is no longer
needed as evidence shall be open to public inspection during the Department's
regular business hours.
   (b)   When the Police Department has property in its possession that is
required to be disposed of pursuant to this section, it shall make a reasonable
effort to locate the persons entitled to possession of the property in its
custody, to notify them of when and where it may be claimed and to return the
property to them at the earliest possible time. In the absence of evidence
idenitfying persons entitled to custody, it is sufficient notice to advertise
in a newspaper of general circulation in the County, briefly describing the
nature of the property in custody, and inviting persons to view and establish
their right to it. Property except that listed under subsection (c)(1) and (2)
and subsection (d)(1), (2), (3) and (4) herein, which is turned in to the
Police Department shall be returned to the person finding the property after
sixty days have passed from the date it was turned in to the Police Department.
   (c)   A person loses any right he may have to the possession of property if
either of the following apply:
      (1)   The property was the subject, or was used in a conspiracy or
attempt to commit, or in the commission, of an offense other than a traffic
offense, and such person is a conspirator, accomplice or offender with respect
to the offense;

because, in light of the nature of the property or the circumstances of such
person, it is unlawful for the person to acquire or possess the property.
   (d)   Unclaimed or forfeited property in the custody of the Police
Department other than contraband that is subject to the provisions of Ohio R.C.

of 1968, 82 Stat. 1213, 18 U.S.C. 923 and any amendments or additions thereto
or any reenactments thereof.
      (3)   All firearms of the type commonly known as "Saturday Night
Specials" and all other dangerous ordnance shall be destroyed.
      (4)   Obscene materials shall be destroyed.
      (5)   Beer, intoxicating liquor or alcohol seized from a person who is
not the holder of a permit issued under Ohio R.C. Chapters 4301 and 4303, or is

shall be sold by the Department of Liquor Control, if the Department determines
that the beer, intoxicating liquor or alcohol is fit for sale. If any tax
imposed under Ohio R.C. Title XLIII has not been paid in relation to the beer,
intoxicating liquor or alcohol, the proceeds of the sale shall first be used to
pay the tax. All other moneys collected under subsection (d)(5) hereof shall be
paid into the State Treasury. Any such beer, intoxicating liquor or alcohol
that the Department determines to be unfit for sale shall be destroyed.
      (6)   Vehicle and vehicle parts forfeited under Ohio R.C. 4549.61 to
4549.63 may be given to a law enforcement agency for use in the performance of
its duties. Such parts may be incorporated into any other official vehicle.
Parts that do not bear vehicle identification numbers or derivatives thereof
may be sold or disposed of as provided by rules of the Director of Highway
Safety. Parts from which a vehicle identification number or derivative thereof
has been removed, defaced, covered, altered or destroyed and that are not
suitable for police work or incorporation into an official vehicle shall be

501.99   PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:

sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28; Ord. 91-24. Passed 8-12-24.)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;

section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
               (Ord. 110-10. Passed 12-6-10.)
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:

Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section 501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to
this subsection (c).
         (ORC 2929.31)
   (d)   Upon the motion of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to
a misdemeanor, the court may in its discretion require that person to perform
supervised community service work under authority of the City of Fairfield in
lieu of imprisonment or the payment of a fine or the payment of court costs or
any combination thereof. The following do not control the court's discretion,

others.
      (2)   The offense was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur.

vaginal or anal intercourse.

sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the

serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

artistic purpose.

   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)   Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this

pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.

established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a

the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

of services by the Water Division.
   (b)   Bylaws and Regulations. The City Manager may make such bylaws and
regulations as are necessary for the safe, economical, efficient management and

Director shall be responsible for approving the design and final acceptance of
all water mains constructed in the City.
   (d)   Inspections. The Superintendent and other authorized employees of the

of inspection, observation, measurement and testing, in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 167-95. Passed 11-13-95.)
921.02   NEW WATER MAIN EXTENSIONS.
   (a)   Generally. Construction of water main extensions shall be at the
property owner's expense except as otherwise provided hereinafter. In those
areas where larger water lines or extensions of water mains are required so as
to preserve and foster the overall integrity and soundness of the water
distribution system, the City may participate in the increased construction and
pipe costs of such lines only after a recommendation to do so from the City
Manager and passage of an ordinance by Council.
(Ord. 34-97. Passed 3-31-97.)
   (b)   Water Main Construction. All water main construction shall adhere to
specifications and drawings in accordance with the Design, Construction and
Materials Specifications Handbook.
(Ord. 128-07. Passed 10-9-07.)
   (c)   Payment for Inspection of City-initiated Work. Inspection for all
water main work initiated by the City shall be paid for from the Water Fund.
(Ord. 34-97. Passed 3-31-97.)

construction work on any part of the water system, the contractor shall provide
a complete set of certified, reproducible as-built drawings to the Public
Utilities Director for all water mains constructed, including those constructed
in subdivisions.
(Ord. 128-07. Passed 10-9-07.)
   (e)   Rules for Submittal of Subdivision Plans and Water Main Extensions.
      (1)   Improvements plans of all proposed subdivisions which include water
mains and other water main extensions shall be submitted to the Public
Utilities Director for approval prior to being submitted to the Planning
Commission for final approval. The subdivider shall confer with the Public
Utilities Director on allowances for extra capacity in the subdivision water
mains that are required for expansion of the water system beyond the limits of
the subdivision before plans are submitted to the Public Utilities Director. No
final plats shall be approved by the Planning Commission until the Public
Utilities Director has approved the detail plans and specifications for the
water mains. All plans and specifications submitted for approval shall be fully
detailed so as to assure conforming and reliable construction, and shall be
stamped by a registered professional engineer. The drawings are to conform to
City standards. If revisions in either plans, specifications or design are
found necessary the submittal shall be returned to the subdivider for revisions
and resubmittal.
   (f)   Inspection.
      (1)   All water main and appurtenant structures shall be inspected during
construction and installation by the Public Works Director or inspectors
assigned by him and responsible to him.
      (2)   The Public Works Director shall appoint or designate an inspector
for periodical or continuous inspection as the type of work may require or as
he deems necessary.
   (g)   Inspection Fees.
      (1)   Classification.
         A.   Inspection fees shall be classified as follows:
1.   Review of preliminary plans.
2.   Continuous and intermittent construction inspection.
3.   Supervisory and final construction inspection.
      (2)   Review of preliminary plans. The fee for review of preliminary
plans accompanying the tentative plat shall be included in the fee charges by
the Planning Commission for submission of the final plat.
      (3)   Continuous and intermittent inspection.
         A.   General. When the extent of work in any project so justifies, the
Public Works Director may provide for a full-time inspector for that project
from his own forces. Where a project does not require full-time inspection, the
Public Works Director may provide for intermittent inspection and may use the
inspector for more than one such project.
         B.   Continuous. The Public Works Director shall send a monthly bill
to the contractor for the time spent for inspection. The charge shall be at the
hourly rate paid the inspectors by the City, plus thirty percent (30%), a
minimum billing of one-half hour. If inspection is required at a time when the
inspector is designated to receive overtime pay, the charge shall be at the
overtime rate paid the inspector, plus thirty percent (30%) with a minimum
billing of one-half hour.
         C.   Intermittent inspection may be provided when and where the Public
Works Director may consider this arrangement satisfactory. Charges for
intermittent inspection shall be the same as those for continuous inspection
based on actual hours of service, including time allowance for travel.
   (h)   Revisions. During construction, no departure from approved plans and
specifications shall be made unless a request for a change is submitted to the
Public Utilities Director in writing and approval in writing is obtained.
   (i)   Easements. The subdivider shall give the City any easements for future
water mains recommended by the Public Utilities Director. Any such easements
shall be recorded on the plan, and filed for approval with the Planning
Commission. In the event it becomes necessary to construct water mains outside
the limits of any platted easement, easements to include the mains shall be
given to the City by separate instrument. All water mains shall be constructed
in public easements or rights of way.
   (j)   Allowances for Larger Pipe Requirements. If the Public Utilities

installed, the Water Division shall repair and maintain it or replace it with a
branch of the same size from the main to and including the curb stop within the
right of way or to the limits of the right of way if the valve is outside of
the right of way. The property owner is responsible for maintaining the balance
of the service branch, with the exception of the water meter, to assure a safe
water supply and in a structural condition that will permit water service
without leakage. Complete replacement must be made where it is determined by
the Public Utility Director or designee that a line is leaking or otherwise
defective. Failure by the owner to make timely repairs to or replacement of the
service line will result in the termination or refusal of water service.
   (f)   Replacement of Water Meter/Repair of Associated Water Line.  The City
has the right to replace or require replacement of any water meter as deemed
necessary to prevent leaks or otherwise protect the water supply. The City
shall not be responsible for breakage of pipes or valves occurring during

faulty plumbing. The City may terminate or refuse water service if a meter
cannot be installed or replaced appropriately due to the condition of the water
line adjacent to the meter. (Ord. 84-14. Passed 9-8-14.)

year after the actual work has been performed. The bond shall be conditioned so
as to insure proper workmanship and materials used and shall save the City
harmless from claims arising as a result of damage to any person or property by
reason of such work on the City’s water distribution system. Such bond shall be
approved by the Law Director as to form and surety. Nothing contained in this

testing the same on the premises or for the purpose of removing the meter from
the premises for the above purposes or for the purpose of turning on or off the
water supply in the water service branch.
   (d)   Setting of Meters. A meter shall be installed on any water service
branch as soon as practical after the installation of the branch and in every
case prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the Building

amount will be charged at the normal residential/commercial rate.
   (b)   Use of Water Without a Permit. No person, firm or corporation shall
use or make a connection to use water from a fire hydrant or other available

hose or connection found attached to a fire hydrant or other available source
of water for which no temporary use permit has been issued.
      (Ord. 84-14. Passed 9-8-14.)
921.07   APPLICATION FOR WATER SERVICE; FEE.
   (a)   Application for water service shall be made by the owner or authorized
agent. Water will be turned on by an authorized employee of the Water Division

service application is made, a deposit of one hundred twenty-five dollars
($125.00) shall be made to the Utility Collection Office which shall be
refunded when the account is paid in full and closed.
   (b)   No application for water service shall be allowed and no water will be
supplied to any applicant or customer if that person, firm or corporation is

furnished or penalties imposed. This shall apply whether the indebtedness was
incurred at the premises for which the application is made or at any other
premises supplied by the Water Division.
(Ord. 27-10. Passed 3-22-10.)

F which are incorporated herein by reference. Existing Appendix E water rates
shall remain in effect until January 1, 2021. Water rates and minimum charges
shall be calculated on a monthly basis. Water customers located outside the

Appendices B, C, D, E and F, plus an additional fifty percent (50%) of each
monthly bill. In-City residential water customers of the City of Fairfield who
are provided wastewater treatment service by an entity other than the City of
Fairfield shall be allowed a monthly credit against their monthly water charges
so that their total water and wastewater charges are the same as those paid by
in-City residential customers who use both City of Fairfield water and
wastewater service, provided that such credit shall not exceed the actual
amount of the customer’s water charges in any month. The Finance Director is
authorized and directed to calculate and apply the credit as described herein.

921.09   BILLING; NONPAYMENT.
   (a)   Unlawful Taking of Water. No person, firm or corporation shall take

are paid, except as otherwise provided for temporary use or Municipal use of
water.
   (b)   Time of Payment. Water bills shall be paid on or before the due date
stated on the bill, after which the account is overdue and subject to a ten
percent (10%) late charge.
   (c)   Termination of Water Service for Nonpayment. If an account is more
than 45 days past due, the Superintendent shall turn off the water service in
accordance with bylaws and regulations established by the City Manager or his/
her designee. There shall be a charge of forty dollars ($40.00) for termination
of water service under this section.
   (d)   Assessing Charges.
      (1)   Any person, firm or corporation served by any water service
connection shall be considered as accepting the provisions of all laws,
ordinances, bylaws and regulations of the Water Division and as agreeing, in
particular, to be liable for all water and service charges for such premises.
      (2)   When more than one meter is supplied by a single service branch and
where only one curb stop is used to control water to that service branch, the
owner of the property on which the service branch is located shall be liable
for all water and service charges for such property whether the account for
such premises is carried in the name of the owner or in the name of tenants or
other persons. The maintenance of water service connections being a substantial
and valuable benefit to land, any owner of real estate premises served by such
water service connections shall assume responsibility for the total of all
water charges levied against the premises during his ownership in the same
manner as the person who actually incurred the charges or in whose name the
account is carried.
   This assumption of responsibility shall be a necessary condition to the
continuation of water service to the premises.
   (e)   Restoration of Water Service. Water service shall not be restored to
any premises for which there is an unpaid water account unless satisfactory
arrangements for the payment of the unpaid account are made pursuant to bylaws

be considered part of the water distribution system. When new mains are laid,
the necessary leads, watch valves and fire hydrants shall be installed
concurrently with the mains and paid for in the same manner. (Ord. 111-83.
Passed 8-8-83.)
921.11   FIRE SERVICE BRANCHES.
   (a)   A fire service branch from the main shall not be used for other than

advance for using water from a fire protection service for any purposes,
including fire drills and pressure testing of a protection system.
   (c)   The Public Utilities Director may order a fire service branch metered
and converted to a domestic account to be billed at the monthly rates for
general customers for any of the following reasons:

   (a)   If, in the judgment of the Public Utilities Director, the integrity of
the public water system, is, or can be, endangered by backflow from an actual
or a potential cross-connection within the plumbing system of a water consumer,
the Public Utilities Director may order the installation of an approved
backflow prevention method or device consisting of either an air-gap, double
sanitary check valve assembly, vacuum breaker, reduced pressure, principal
backflow preventer or any combination thereof at the water service connection
to the premises.
   (b)   The water consumer shall install the designated device or method at
his own expense, and failure, refusal or inability to install such device or
method immediately shall constitute a ground for discontinuing water service to
the premises until the device or method has been installed and approved by the
Public Utilities Director.
   (c)   The use of the approved backflow preventer at the water service
connection does not in any way affect or eliminate the need for individual
fixture devices or air-gaps.
(Ord. 167-95. Passed 11-13-95.)
921.13   WELLS.
   (a)   Required Purpose. No well shall be drilled or dug in the City where

the well if the property can be served by the Water Division.
(Ord. 167-95. Passed 11-13-95.)
921.14   TAMPERING WITH WATER DIVISION EQUIPMENT.
   (a)   No person shall knowingly, without consent of the City Public
Utilities Director or designee:
      (1)   Interfere with, damage, or by-pass a water meter or related

conditions or to recommend denial of a permit/zoning change shall not relieve
the owner or person having possession, charge, or management of such land from
the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom, and shall
not result in the City, its officers or agents being responsible for any
condition or damage resulting therefrom.
      (4)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as authorizing any
person to maintain a private or public nuisance on his property, and compliance
with the provisions of this chapter shall not be a defense in any action to
abate such nuisance.
      (5)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent immediate
action by the City in emergency situations. In case of an emergency, the City
may direct that action be taken immediately to correct the condition or abate
the activity to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. The City may
perform the required work and assess the abatement costs against the property.
 
   (l)   Correction Costs.
      (1)   If the owner or occupant having the care or control of the lands

implemented. The cost for such abatement procedures shall be immediately due
and payable to the City, provided, however, that an administrative fee shall
also be charged in the amount of one hundred dollars. The cost of the
administrative fee together with the cost of the abatement procedure together
with any legal fees incurred by the City shall be assessed against the owner
and, if unpaid, against the lot or land together with interest thereon at the

(Ord. 25-14. Passed 4-14-14.)
925.08   USER CHARGE ESTABLISHED.
   (a)   Charges Established; Classes: Computation.
      (1)   During the effective period of this chapter, there is levied and
assessed a charge or rental known as a "user charge" upon each lot, parcel of
land, building or premises having any sewer connection with the sanitary sewer
system of the City or otherwise discharging wastewater, industrial wastes,
water or other liquids either directly or indirectly into the City wastewater
treatment system.
      (2)   The users of the system shall be divided into classes. Classes
shall be groups of users for which the wastewater characteristics are
approximately equal and services provided are essentially the same. Initially
there shall be established three classes of users, as follows: Industrial,
nonindustrial and commercial. Charges for these classes shall be as shown,
except as otherwise provided herein. The Public Utilities Director may
recommend additional classes as determined to be necessary.
      (3)   Charges for wastewater treatment service shall be paid by each user
connected to the system and shall be computed in accordance with probable
demand a user places on the system and the quantity of water discharged to the
system, as measured by the City water meter installed thereon and/or by a
sewage meter installed on the discharge pipe therefrom and/or as estimated by
the City, and in accordance with the charge schedule hereinafter set forth.
      (4)   When a considerable amount of water delivered to any premises is
not returned to the City's wastewater collection system, the customer, with the
permission and approval of the Public Utilities Director, may install a
separate water meter to determine the amount of such water not returned to the
wastewater disposal system. The customer shall not be billed sewer use charges
for such water not returned to the sewage disposal system. The cost of the
water meter and its installation shall be the responsibility of the customer.
The manner of installation of the water meter must be specifically approved in
writing by the Public Utilities Director. Upon a determination by either the
Public Utilities Director or the customer that the use of direct metering
sanitary sewage flow is necessary or is a more equitable method of determining
sewage disposal charges, the Public Utilities Director may approve the
installation and use of wastewater meters.
         (Ord. 25-14. Passed 4-14-14.)
      (5)   Irrigation credit. A special sewer rate structure for residential
domestic service accounts will be used during the summer months (May, June,
July, August, September and October) in determining sewer charges to account
for water used for outside or other irrigation purposes and not returned to the
City Sanitary Sewer System. The special rate will eliminate sewer charges for
all domestic residential service water in excess of one hundred and fifty
percent (150%) of the average monthly water amount used during the previous
winter season (November, December, January and February) for that account. In
the event that a complete winter season average cannot be established, an
amount of 7,500 gallons per month will be used in establishing a base winter
season monthly average. (Ord. 18-21. Passed 2-22-21.)
      (6)   In-City residential wastewater customers of the City of Fairfield
who are provided water service by an entity other than the City of Fairfield
shall also be allowed a credit against their monthly wastewater charges so that
their total monthly water and wastewater charges are the same as those paid by
in-City residential customers who use both City of Fairfield water and
wastewater service, provided that such credit shall not exceed the actual
amount of the customer's wastewater charges in any month. The Finance Director
is authorized and directed to calculate and apply the credit as described
herein. (Ord. 25-14. Passed 4-14-14.)
 
   (b)   User Charge Rate Structure.
      (1)   The sewer rates for all users of sewer service provided by the City
within the corporate limits of the City shall be as shown in the Attached
Tables A through E, inclusive, which are incorporated herein by reference and
which shall be effective upon the dates stated therein. The existing sewer
rates as shown in existing Table D effective January 1, 2020 shall remain in
effect until January 1, 2021.
         (Ord. 87-20. Passed 10-26-20.)
      (2)   The sewer rates for sewage treatment service provided by Butler
County, Ohio to users of sanitary sewer service within the corporate limits of
the City, shall be based upon the Butler County Regional Wastewater System
rates for transmission and treatment of wastewater, as those rates may be
amended from time to time, plus an additional amount of twenty percent (20%) of
the Butler County Regional Wastewater System rates. Such charges for sewer
service shall be remitted to the City. The minimum quantities for sewer service
based upon water meter size which are applicable to users of sewer service
provided by the City shall also apply to users of Butler County sewage
treatment service within the corporate limits ofthe City and such minimum
quantities shall also be charged at the Butler County Regional Wastewater
System rate, plus an additional twenty percent (20%).
      (3)   Capacity fees for new public sewer connections shall be paid to the
City by the users of sewage treatment service provided by Butler County, Ohio
within the corporate limits of the City. Such capacity fees shall be in
accordance with the Butler County Regional "Schedule of Equivalent Residential
Units", and in such amounts as are presently established and periodically
amended by Butler County, Ohio subsequent to the passage of this section. Such
fees shall be paid by the user prior to the issuance of a permit to connect to
the public sewer.
 
   (c)   Rates Outside Corporate Limits. The rates for users of sewer services
provided by the City outside the corporate limits of the City shall be the same
as those for users of sewer service inside the corporate limits of the City,
plus an additional charge of fifty percent (50%) of the total of each monthly
sewer bill, unless provided otherwise by specific agreement of the City. Such
additional charge shall be used for debt service and capital expenditures of
the sewer system.
 
   (d)   Determination of Discharge.
      (1)   In the event a lot, parcel of land, building or premises discharges
to a City sanitary sewer, either directly or indirectly, and is not a user of
water supplied by the City, the amount of discharge to the sanitary sewer shall
be determined by the Public Utilities Director in such manner as he may find
practicable in light of the conditions and attendant circumstances.
      (2)   Charges for such service shall be at the rates provided in
subsection (b) hereof with a minimum charge as set forth therein. If a lot,
parcel of land, building or premises not served with water by the City has a
water meter, the minimum sewer charge shall be based upon the size of the water
meter.
 
   (e)   Unreported Discharge. If premises are found to be discharging
wastewater to the City sanitary sewer system without payment of a sewer service
charge, the Public Utilities Director shall measure or estimate the quantity of
such wastes, by such methods as he may find practicable for the purpose of
establishing a proper charge and such premises shall be charged for the total
term of the prior usage on the basis of the quantity so determined, and in
accordance with previous charges.
   
   (f)   High Strength Surcharges. In addition to the minimum charge and the
volume charge, any user discharging wastewater containing BOD in excess of 200
mg/1 or COD in excess of 500 mg/1 or suspended solids in excess of 250 mg/1 or
ammonia nitrogen in excess of 11.4 mg/1 shall pay the following additional
charges:
 
   BOD* 0.136 per pound of excess over 200 mg/1
   COD* 0.039 per pound of excess over 500 mg/1
   SS 0.136 per pound of excess over 250 mg/1
   NH4 0.606 per pound of excess over 11.4 mg/1
 
   * Either BOD or COD shall be used, not both. Option to be selected by the
Public Utilities Director.
 
   (g)   Sampling and Metering.
      (1)   For purposes of high strength surcharges, and ascertaining
pretreatment compliance the Public Utilities Director shall have the option of
sampling and testing a wastewater and billing the user for the sampling or
requiring the user to perform a regular sampling and testing program, approved
by the Public Utilities Director, at the user's expense. The user shall make
all data available to the Public Utilities Director upon request and the Public
Utilities Director shall be allowed to sample the wastewater, as necessary, to
verify the user's data.
      (2)   In addition to the other charges, each user shall be charged fifty
dollars ($50.00) for each sampling and metering performed by the Public
Utilities Director. A fee shall be charged for each sampling permit in which
samples are collected and analyzed. Sampling period shall not exceed a twenty-
four hour day.
 
   (h)   Sewer Service Charge for Private System.  There shall be a sewer
charge for all lots situated in the area to be served by a private sewer system
and the service charge shall remain in force and effect so long as the system
is being used for the purpose or purposes and under conditions for which it was
constructed. The amount of the service charge shall be determined by the Public
Utilities Director.
 
   (i)   Industrial Contracts. The Director may contract with industrial or
sanitary users to receive acceptable wastes not part of the normal waste
stream, or cover other situation(s) not covered by this chapter, provided such
contracts are governed by user charges and other regulations set forth in this
chapter.
 
   (j)   Revisions. On or before September 1 of each year, the Director shall
review the laws, ordinances, bylaws, regulations, charges and fees set forth.
If changes, revisions or modifications are necessary, he shall submit the
changes to the City Manager for necessary action. The charge system shall be in
accordance with EPA regulations which now require:
      (1)   The charges shall result in the distribution of operation,
maintenance and replacement costs of the treatment works within the
jurisdiction of the City to each user class in proportion to such user's
contribution of the total wastewater loading of the treatment works. Factors
such as strength, value and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be
included to ensure a proportional distribution of the costs.
      (2)   The charges shall be reviewed annually and revised periodically as
required.
      (3)   The charges shall derive revenue sufficient to meet all costs of
operation, maintenance and replacement of the system.
      (4)   Users shall be notified annually of revised sewer user rate
structures by notification mailed with a regular sewer bill.

such vacant residential units. The application shall be made under oath or
affirmation on forms provided by the City and shall contain such information as
the Director of Finance determines is necessary to properly verify the vacancy
and identification of the billing account to which the requested exemption
applies. Such forms must be received in the Department of Finance on or before

paid by the cable operator upon demand of the City, unless contrary to
applicable rules of the FCC governing these procedures or unless otherwise

as approved by the State of Ohio. The International Building Code
administrative requirements (Chapter 1) are not adoptive material and are
replaced with administrative requirements promulgated by the State of Ohio. See
OAC Chapter 4101:1-1. The Ohio Building Code (OAC Chapters 4101:1-1 through [2-
35] 4101:1-35).
   (c)   The Ohio Mechanical Code, current edition which is based on the

materials, erection, installation, alteration, repair, location, relocation,
addition to, use or maintenance of mechanical systems, and providing for the
issuance of permits and the collection of fees. Additional requirements and
regulations as per Chapter 1337, Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning.
   (d)   Such standards shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and

that plumbing is under the jurisdiction of the Butler County Health Department.
   (e)   Pursuant to §
1301.04   CODE REMEDIAL.
   This Code is hereby declared to be remedial, and shall be construed to
secure the beneficial interests and purposes thereof, which are public safety,
health, and general welfare, through structural strength, stability,
sanitation, adequate light and ventilation, and safety to life and property
from fire and other hazards incidental to the construction, alteration, repair,
removal, demolition, use and occupancy of buildings, structures or premises.
(Ord. 46-13. Passed 5-28-13.)
1301.05   SCOPE.
   (a)   The administrative provisions of this Code shall apply to the
construction, alteration, repair, equipment, use and occupancy, location,
maintenance, removal and demolition of every building or structure or any
appurtenances connected or attached to such buildings or structures.
   (b)   No provisions of this Code shall be held to deprive any Federal or
State agency, or any Municipal authority having jurisdiction, of any power or
authority which it had on the effective date of this act or any remedy then
existing for the enforcement of its orders. (Ord. 46-13. Passed 5-28-13.)
1301.06   EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   (a)   Alterations or Repairs. Alterations or repairs may be made to any
structure without requiring the existing structure to comply with all the
requirements of this Code, provided the alteration or repair conforms to that
required of a new structure; however, if the structure is increased in floor
area or number of stories, the entire structure shall be made to conform with
the requirements of the applicable Code in respect to means of egress, fire
protection, light and ventilation.
   (b)   Unsafe Alterations. No building, or building service equipment
therein, shall be so altered or repaired as to be less safe or sanitary.
   (c)   Change of Occupancy. If the occupancy of an existing building is
entirely changed, the building shall be made to conform to the requirements of
the applicable Code for the new occupancy. If the occupancy of only a portion
of an existing building is changed and that portion is separated from the
remainder, then only that portion need be made to conform. (Ord. 46-13. Passed
5-28-13.)
1301.07   MAINTENANCE.
   All buildings, structures and service equipment, and all parts thereof,
shall be maintained in a safe and sanitary condition. All devices or safeguards
which are required by this Code in a building when erected, altered, or

of the other parts or provisions hereof, and it shall be presumed that Council
would have passed this Code without such illegal or invalid parts or
provisions.

effectiveness, fire-resistance, durability and safety. The Board of Building
Appeals shall require that sufficient evidence or proof be submitted to
substantiate any claims that may be made regarding its use.
