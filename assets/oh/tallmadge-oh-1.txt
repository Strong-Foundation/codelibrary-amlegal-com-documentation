EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
 
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier

defeat or approve legislation; such legislation may remain before the Council
or be referred back to the appropriate Committee of Council.
Each Ordinance or Resolution for immediate enactment shall require the
affirmative vote of a least three-fourths (6) of the total members of Council
for its enactment. If it fails to receive the requisite three-fourths (6)

one meeting and continued to another, it shall be deemed properly noticed
provided the new date is announced at the time the hearing is continued.

125.02 MINIMUM FUND BALANCE POLICY.
   (a)    Purpose. This policy is designed to take a proactive approach to
financial management in the City of Tallmadge. A minimum fund balance policy
assists the City in maintaining the security of major operating funds and
contributes to the financial stability of the City by maintaining adequate
financial reserves. Also, a minimum fund balance policy will allow the
Administration and Council to recognize and react to warning indicators of
financial stress and set guidelines for proactive measures.
   (b)    Policy. At the time of budget preparation, annual appropriations
shall be adjusted to ensure that the Anticipated Fund Balances are greater than
or equal to the Minimum Fund Balance as described in the scope of this policy.
   (c)    Definitions.
      (1)    "Projected Beginning Fund Balance" means the projected
unencumbered fund balance for the beginning of the fiscal year. The projected
beginning fund balance is calculated at the time the budget is prepared.
      (2)    "Operating Appropriation" means total appropriations including
transfers for Bond Retirement and Pension as these represent ongoing
commitments of the City. Excluded are all other transfers and capital
appropriations.
      (3)    "Anticipated Revenue" means the amount of revenue the City expects
to receive in the upcoming fiscal year to fund annual appropriations.
      (4)    "Anticipated Fund Balance" means an amount equal to the Projected
Beginning Fund Balance less Total Appropriations plus Anticipated Revenue. The
anticipated fund balance is calculated at the time the budget is prepared.
      (5)    "Financial Review Committee" means a committee to review financial
matters of the City, consisting of the Director of Finance, Mayor, Director of
Administration, Chairman of Finance Committee of Council, and member of the
Finance Committee of Council.
   (d)    Scope.
      (1)    This Policy applies to all Major Funds used by the City and are
listed below in three different categories:
         A.    Category 1: These funds have more than one million dollars
($1,000,000) in operating appropriations and receive no more than 10% of
revenue from transfers. They have their own significant source of revenues and
therefore should be required to carry a minimum fund balance of 25% of
operating appropriations. These funds are Category 1 Major Funds and include:
General Fund, Sanitary Sewer Operating Fund, and Water Operating Fund.
         B.    Category 2: These funds have more than one million dollars
($1,000,000) in operating appropriations. They rely heavily on operating
transfers and therefore should be required to carry a smaller minimum fund
balance of 8.5% of operating appropriations. These funds are Category 2 Major
Funds and include: Fire/EMS Fund and Street Maintenance and Repair Fund.
Note: The Self Insurance Fund would fall under a Category 2 fund, although it
has separate legislation that requires a minimum balance of one hundred
thousand dollars ($ l,000,000) due to the nature of that fund.
         C.    Category 3: These funds are created for the sole purpose of a
capital project, whether governmental, enterprise, internal service, trust, or
agency funds. These are Category 3 Major Fund status even if they satisfy the
criteria for the above two categories. There is no requirement to maintain a
minimum fund balance on these funds.
      (2)    All other funds are considered minor funds and are not required to
maintain a minimum fund balance. Funds may be recategorized as needed if they
meet the requirements of Category 1, 2, or 3 at a future date.
   (e)   Application.
      (1)    The anticipated fund balance will be calculated at the time of
budget preparation. Anticipated fund balance will be calculated taking the
budget year's projected beginning fund balance less appropriations (which may
include debt service) plus anticipated revenue. The resulting fund balance must
comply to the minimum fund balances established in the scope of this policy.
      (2)    This policy will be applied to the annual operating budget of the
City prior to presenting it to Council. Any changes in the budget made by
Council must also comply with the restrictions established in this policy prior
to the adoption of the annual appropriation ordinance.
   (f)    Monitoring. Fund balances will be monitored on a month-to-month
basis. Monitoring projections will be based upon trend data. The fund balances
may drop temporarily below the minimum level due to current operations or
emergencies. Additional monitoring and reports will be done per the Financial
Action Plan when required.
   (g)    Compliance. Once it is determined that the City cannot meet the
requirements of this policy, the Mayor will include a concise statement in the
annual appropriations ordinance explaining the decision to waive the policy.
The statement should include the present financial status of the City, a
specified timetable for returning to the policy, and reason(s) given for
overriding the policy. Should it be determined that the City will not be able
to fall within conformance within one year, the Financial Action Plan will be
implemented.
   (h)    Financial Action Plan. Once it is determined that the General Fund
will not be able to meet the required 25% reserve, the financial action plan
shall be implemented in various stages for each category of funds.
      (1)    Category I Funds - General Fund:
         A.    Step I Projected reserves drop between 20% to 25%.
            1.    If the reserves drop below 25% because of a one-time capital
purchase, no action will be needed on the assumption that the reserves will be
met within one year.
            2.    If the reserves drop below 25% due to operational expenses,
the Director of Administration shall, during the budget process, reduce all
possible appropriations. If this process brings the budget within the required
25% reserve, no further action is required.
            3.    If the above process does not provide for the required
reserves, the reserve may be reduced to 20%, provided that a report is compiled
from the Mayor, as stated in the Compliance section of this policy.
         B.    Step 2 Projected reserves drop between 15% to 20%.
            1.    If the reserves drop between 15%-20%, the City must take
additional measures to limit expenditures and increase revenues.
            2.    The City will enact a hiring freeze for any additional
personnel who are funded through this fund, unless there is a revenue
generating program to pay for the individual(s).
            3.    All non-union wages may be frozen; a request for wage
concessions from its union employees will be made.
            4.    All non-essential expenditures shall cease.
            5.   The use of contractual employees and/or consultants will be
closely scrutinized and discouraged.
            6.    Purchase of capital items shall only be made if absolutely
necessary, provided that those purchases do not increase future operating
costs.
            7.    The Mayor and his/her designees shall review all charges for
fees and seek additional revenue sources.
            8.    The Director of Administration shall prepare a two-year
budget projection to determine the long-term financial impact of the
recommended changes.
            9.    The Financial Review Committee shall meet and consider the
necessary suggestions for revenue enhancements.
         C.    Step 3 Projected reserves drop between 10% to 15%.

alternatives.
            3.    Reduction in staffing shall be reviewed and considered.
            4.    The Financial Review Committee shall meet to discuss revenue
enhancements, tax levies, and reductions in personnel. The Committee must
present a report back to Council with a financial plan for recovery.
            5.    This reduction in reserves should not be considered as
acceptable.
         D.    Step 4 Protected reserves drop below 10%.
            1.    The City should be considered in a fiscal crisis and shall
take all measures necessary to improve the financial condition of the City.
            2.    In addition to the steps above, tax levies must be
considered.
            3.    Capital purchases must be held to an absolute minimum or
stopped.
            4.    Mandatory reduction of staffing at all levels.
            5.    Reciprocity of income tax should be reduced.
            6.    All City Administrators shall work to make every effort to
raise revenues to bolster their reserves and limit expenditures. This may
continue for multiple years, but it is suggested to make changes in a short
time frame.
      (2)    Category I - Enterprise Funds (Water and Sewer Operating).
         A.    Step 1 Projected reserves drop between 20% to 25%.
            1.    If the reserves drop below 25% because of a one-time capital
purchase, no further action will be needed on the assumption that the reserves
will be met within one year.
            2.    If the reserves drop below 25% due to operational expenses,
the Director of Administration shall, during the budget process, reduce all
possible appropriations. If this step brings the budget within the required 25%
reserve, no further action is required.
            3.    If the above process does not provide for the required
reserves, the reserve may be reduced to 20%, provided that a report is compiled
from the Mayor, as stated in the Compliance section of this policy.
            4.    During the fiscal year that the fund is below 25% reserve,
the Director of Public Service may raise fees to bring the fund back into
alignment.
         B.    Step 2 Projected reserves drop between 15% to 20%.
            1.    If the reserves drop between 15%-20%, the City must take
additional measures to limit expenditures and increase revenues.
            2.    The City will enact a hiring freeze for any additional
personnel who are funded through this fund, unless there is a revenue
generating program to pay for the individual(s).
            3.    All non-union wages may be frozen; a request for wage
concessions from its union employees will be made.
            4.    All non-essential expenditures shall cease.
            5.   The use of contractual employees and or consultants will be
closely scrutinized and discouraged.
            6.    Purchase of capital items shall only be made if absolutely
necessary, provided that those purchases do not increase future operating
costs.
            7.   The Director of Public Service shall notify Council and may
institute a rate increase for the enterprise fund(s).
            8.    The Director of Administration shall prepare a two-year
budget projection to determine the long-term financial impact of the
recommended changes.
            9.    The Director of Public Service must do a rate study which
reflects the anticipated revenues and expenditures along with capital outlays
for the particular enterprise fund.
         C.    Step 3 Protected reserves drop below 15%.
            1.    If the reserves drop below 15%, it is considered unacceptable
and the above actions must continue.
            2.    Reduction in staffing shall be reviewed.
      (3)    Category 2 Funds - Fire/EMS and Street Maintenance and Repair
(SMR).
         A.    Step 1 Projected reserves drop below 8.5%.
            1.    If the reserves drop below 8.5% due to operational expenses,
the Director of Administration shall, during the budget process, reduce all
possible appropriations. If this step brings the budget within the required
8.5% reserve, no further action is required.
            2.    When these funds are unable to meet the 8.5% reserve,
revenues may be transferred in from the General Fund when possible.
            3.    Should the General Fund be unable to meets its required
reserve, the Category 2 funds balances may drop to 5%, provided that a report
is compiled from the Mayor, as stated in the Compliance section of this policy.
         B.    Step 2 Projected reserves drop below 5%.
            1.    All City Administrators shall work to make every effort to
raise revenues to bolster their reserves and limit expenditures.
            2.    The City will enact a hiring freeze for any additional
personnel charged to the specific fund, unless there is a revenue generating
program to pay for the individual(s).
            3.    Reduction in staffing shall be reviewed.

concessions from its union employees will be made.
            6.    All non-essential expenditures shall cease.
            7.    The use of contractual employees and/or consultants will be
closely scrutinized and discouraged.
            8.    Purchases of capital items shall only be made if absolutely
necessary, provided that those purchases do not increase future operating
costs.
            9.    The Mayor, Director of Administration, and Finance Director
shall review all charges for fees and evaluate new revenue sources, including
but not limited to, tax levy replacements, additional levies, etc.
            10.   The Director of Administration shall prepare a two-year
budget projection to determine the long term financial impact of the
recommended changes.

CHAPTER 145
Records Commission
145.01   Public records policy.
CROSS REFERENCES
Photostat or microfilm recording - see Ohio R.C. 9.01
 
145.01  PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY.
   (a)   Records Defined. For purposes of this Chapter, “records” means any
document, paper, electronic including but not limited to e-mail, or other
format, that is created or received by, or comes under the jurisdiction of a
public office that documents the organization, functions, policies, decisions,
procedures, operations, or other activities of the City of Tallmadge. All
records of the City of Tallmadge are public unless they are specifically exempt
from disclosure under the Ohio Revised Code or otherwise by law.
   (b)   Records Policy. It is the policy of the City of Tallmadge that public
records will be organized and maintained so that they can be made available for
inspection and copying at all reasonable times during regular business hours.
Record retention schedules are to be made readily available to the public.
   (c)   Records Requests.
      (1)   Each request for public records will be evaluated for a response in
accordance with the following guidelines:
      (2)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian for the
office must contact the requester for clarification, and should assist the
requestor in revising the request by informing the requester of the manner in
which the office keeps its records.
      (3)   A requester does not have to put a records request in writing, and
does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public records.
      (4)   Public records are available for inspection at all reasonable times
during regular business hours with the exception of published holidays. Records
are available in the Police Department, Fire Department, and Street Department
during hours posted at those locations.
      (5)   Records are to be made available for inspection promptly. Copies of
public records are to be made available within a reasonable period of time.
“Prompt” and “reasonable” take into account the volume of records requested;
the proximity of the location where the records are stored; the age of the
records; and the necessity for any legal review of the records requested.
      (6)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, current meeting minutes, budgets, salary information, forms and
applications, current personnel rosters, etc. If fewer than 20 pages of copies
are requested, or if the records are readily available in an electronic format
that can be e-mailed or downloaded easily, these should be made as quickly as
the equipment and personnel allows. If more copies are requested, the requester
will make an appointment to pick up the copies.
      (7)   All requests for public records must either be satisfied or
acknowledged in writing by the public office receiving the request. A good
faith effort should be made to respond within three business days of the
receipt of the request. If a request is deemed significantly beyond “routine”,
such as keeping a voluminous number of copies or requiring extensive research,
an acknowledgment of the request should be made.
      (8)   Payment for costs of public records may be required in advance of
delivery. Members of the public may not copy the records themselves.
      (9)   Any public office may limit the number of copies requested to be

information contained in them, for commercial purposes.
   (d)   Denial of Record Request. Any denial of public records requested must
include an explanation, including legal authority. If portions of a record are

group.
      (4)   Application of equal employment opportunity in all personnel
actions.
         A.   Recruitment.
            1.   In all recruitment activities, effort will be made to attract
numbers of candidates including qualified persons for whom equality of
employment opportunity is especially sought by this policy, so that fair
consideration can be given to them. As may be feasible, candidates will be
sought from sources, institutions, or publications through which qualified
candidates might be expected to be located and informed of the job
opportunities at all levels.
            2.   The Civil Service Commission will serve as the central
recruiting office for classified civil service employment and will apply the
principles specified herein in the recruitment of personnel into such
employment and in referral of candidates to appointing department heads.
            3.   Other departments and appointing authorities responsible for
the process of recruitment of non civil service and other special personnel of
the City, contract or otherwise, will also apply the principles of
nondiscrimination in recruitment practices.

            1.   Applicants for job openings will be considered on a basis of
qualifications only as those qualifications relate to specific job-related
selection criteria.
            2.   Reasonable records will be kept on the history of each
employment, sufficient to indicate whether, in what manner, and to what extent
the principles of this policy have been applied. Such records will reflect, but
not be limited to, the specific basis on which one candidate was offered
appointment in preference to all others.
            3.   All applications for regular positions will be retained for a
minimum of one year. All applications for temporary positions will be retained
for six months.
            4.   The EEOC will monitor the flow of appointments and of their
respective recruitment circumstances, and will counsel department heads
especially with regard to areas of operations where major opportunity for
improvement emerges. Job criteria will be reviewed as necessary to guard
against invalid disproportionate rejection of candidates by racial or ethnic
groups or by sex.

color, sex, national origin, handicap or identity as a disabled veteran or
veteran of the Vietnam era and age insofar as required by law.
         D.   Testing.
            1.   Applicants who are required to pass a test to be considered
for employment, job assignment, transfer or promotion will be advised of any
scoring requirements if rigid requirements for passing are imposed, and will be
informed of their test results. Results of tests taken will be retained by the
EEOC.
            2.   Tests and standards of passing shall not, inadvertently or
otherwise, result in unlawful discrimination or adverse impact, and will be
reviewed upon each administration to preclude unlawful discrimination from
occurring.
         E.   Promotion.
            1.   Records shall be maintained and updated annually whereby
lateral and/or vertical movement of employees can be ascertained and evaluated
with special reference to equality of opportunity for promotion.
            2.   Formal promotion procedures insofar as civil service laws
permit, shall be maintained to ensure equality of opportunity for promotion.

organizations, insofar as they apply to promotions as well as to other matters,
shall conform to law both as to content and implementation.

termination of employment of any employee.
            2.   In the event of any substantial and necessary planned
reductions in force, the City will prepare such plans with reference to the
equal employment opportunity policy, in addition to other factors; and all
reasonable and lawful steps will be taken to assure that no layoff or
termination occurs on a basis of race, religion, color, sex, national origin,
age, handicap or identity as a disabled veteran or veteran of the Vietnam era.
As to persons covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the lawful terms of
the agreement regarding layoff and termination shall prevail.
         G.   Salary and fringe benefits.
            1.   No award of salary or fringe benefits to any employee shall be

origin, handicap, or identity as a disabled veteran or veteran of the Vietnam
era.

salary and fringe benefit status of all of its employees, with special
reference to reassurance that no unlawful discrimination exists between
individual employees in equivalent positions with comparable qualification,
experience, responsibilities, and performance levels. Remedies proved to be
needed will be made, according to law, and subject to availability of
resources.
         H.   Terms and conditions of employment.
            1.   There shall be no unlawful discrimination as to the terms and
conditions of employment. For purposes of this policy, terms and conditions of
employment shall include but not be limited to such factors as working
environment, educational and training opportunities, deliberative processes
unless required by a lawful collective bargaining agreement, or attendance
requirements.
            2.   Subject to law and regulations, women will not be specially
penalized in their conditions of employment because of pregnancy or childbirth.
Maintenance of seniority or other fringe benefits shall be on the same basis as
in the case of other officially authorized leaves of absences subject to the
terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement.
   (f)   EEO Complaint Resolutions.
      (1)   A formal grievance procedure has been established under this
policy.
         A.   A grievance is a complaint, dispute or other controversy in which
it is claimed that the City has failed in an obligation under the EEO policy or

oral response.
            2.   Step 2: If the grievance is not settled at the first step the
aggrieved will reduce the grievance or allegation to writing. The written
grievance must be presented to the supervisor and department head within five
working days after receipt of the Step 1 answer. The supervisor or department
head shall reply, in writing, within five working days after receipt of the

            3.   Step 3: If the grievance is not settled at Step 2 the
aggrieved may appeal, in writing to the Mayor or his/her designate, such appeal
must be submitted within seven working days after receipt of the Step 2 reply.

EEOC for a hearing.
            5.   Hearing time. The Commission shall schedule a hearing within
thirty days at a time and place convenient to the parties.
            6.   Jurisdiction. The Commission shall be expressly limited to the
meaning, intent, or application of the provisions of this policy. It shall have
no power to add to, detract from, or alter in any way these provisions.
            7.   Decision in Writing. The decision of the EEOC shall be in
writing.
      (2)   Whenever any such formal grievance or complaint is filed, and
consists of or includes alleged discrimination in violation of the equal
employment opportunity policy or of laws pertaining to equal opportunity, the
procedure shall also include immediate notification to the EEOC. The EEOC will
separately examine the element or elements of the grievance alleging
discrimination, and will provide the results of such examination to the Mayor,
Law Director, and the appropriate appointing authority, before final
disposition of the grievance.
      (3)   Remedial action shall be taken immediately upon determination of a

      (4)   In any instance in which a complainant files a complaint with a
governmental agency of competent jurisdiction, alleging discrimination in
violation of valid laws and regulations, and in which the City is officially
notified of such complaint, the complaint shall be examined by the EEOC. In
instances requiring external responses, there shall be consultation with the
Mayor and Law Director before formal response.
   (g)   Handicapped Provisions. Special provisions relating to the handicapped
are:
      (1)   A "handicapped person" is defined as one who:
         A.   Has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits
one or more major life activities.
         B.   Has a record of such impairment.
         C.   Is regarded as having such an impairment.
      (2)   Pursuant to law, the City does not discriminate against any
employee or applicant because of handicap, in regard to any position for which
the employee or applicant is qualified.
      (3)   The City will make reasonable accommodation to the known
limitations of a qualified handicapped applicant or employee, unless the
accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the City or unless the safety
or health of employees, the public or recipients of City services, would be
adversely affected by such accommodation of placement. In determining what does
not constitute reasonable accommodation, the elements of business necessity,
financial cost, and any relating personnel problems, among others, may be
considered.
      (4)   Special care will be taken to ensure that employment criteria are
job related and do not needlessly have the effect of excluding the handicapped
from consideration. The EEOC will review position employment criteria from time
to time and will act as the compliance coordinator.
      (5)   The City may inquire into an applicant's ability to substantially
perform job related tasks effectively and safely, and into the extent and
status of the job-related handicap, provided that information be voluntarily
given and shall be kept confidential except as provided herein.
      (6)   The City may require a physical examination of any employee or of
any applicant who has been conditionally offered employment. Such examination
shall not result in unlawful discrimination on the basis of handicap and the
results shall be held confidential except as provided herein.

inquiries into applicants' or employees' physical and mental conditions shall
be kept confidential except that appropriate supervisors shall be informed

personnel need to be informed; and except as compliance reporting under law
requires inclusion of such information.

veterans and veterans of the Vietnam era pursuant to the 1977 Veterans

job related and do not needlessly have the effect of excluding disabled
veterans or veterans of the Vietnam era from being considered.
      (2)   The City will make reasonable accommodations for the disabled
veteran in the same manner and on the same criteria on which it does for
handicapped employees and applicants.
      (3)   In offering employment or promotions to disabled veterans and
veterans of the Vietnam era, the City will not reduce the amount of
compensation offered as payment for work because of any disability income,
pension, or other benefit the applicant or employee receives from any other
source.
      (4)   All employees and applicants for employment are given opportunity
to identify themselves as disabled veterans and veterans of the Vietnam era in
order to avail themselves of benefits of this policy.
   (i)   Enforcement. The Civil Service Commission acting as the City's Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, is hereby authorized to promulgate rules
necessary to carry out the spirit, intent and effectiveness of this policy.
(Ord. 169-1991. Passed 1-9-92)
149.04 MERIT PAY PLAN FOR CITY EMPLOYEES IN NONCOLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT
POSITIONS.
   (a)   The Merit Pay Plan.
      (1)   The Merit Pay Plan is based on an appraisal process which consists
of three basic components: a written evaluation completed by both the
supervisor and the employee; performance based discussion between the
supervisor and employee, and a quantitative summary of the final evaluation.
The Supervisors should review all performance appraisals with his/her
appointing authority. Department of Administration should be consulted when the
employee is rated above or below expectations.
      (2)   The formal Performance Appraisal process is to be conducted
annually in November.
      (3)   Merit pay will be calculated on the basis of the evaluation
completed by the supervisors and will be effective January 1 of the new year.
      (4)   Eligible employees will consist of full and part-time employees in
nonbargaining positions who have been in their position for at least one year.
      (5)   If an employee is not eligible for a merit pay award in January due
to the fact that he/she has not completed a year of service, the employee will
be eligible for a merit pay adjustment on his/her first anniversary date. After
this, the employee will participate in the regularly scheduled merit pay
program.
      (6)   Elected officials, intermittent, special and seasonal employees are
not eligible for merit pay increases. Their increases will be based off of the
annual wage adjustment approved by Council.
      (7)   Any employee who is a member of a union is not eligible for merit
pay.
   (b)   The Performance Appraisal Process.
      (1)   The appraisal process will begin with the supervisor and the
employee each completing a performance form for the employee. Each will
complete the written form within one week of receiving it. By November 30,
supervisors are required to forward their evaluations to their appointing
authority. Each evaluation completed by a supervisor will be reviewed by his/
her appointing authority for the purpose of ensuring consistency and fairness
in evaluations. If an appointing authority feels that a supervisor’s
evaluations reveal inconsistencies, the appointing authority retains the right
to challenge the supervisor’s evaluations. The supervisor and employee will
then meet with the purpose of discussing their evaluations, discuss both
positive and negative aspects of the employee’s performance to identify and
resolve areas of agreement/disagreement and set goals for future performance.
The employee should be encouraged to present his/her viewpoint and the
supervisor retains the right to choose whether to modify his/her rating based
on the employee’s input.
      (2)   If an employee feels aggrieved by the evaluation process, he/she
has the right to present a written appeal to the Department of Administration.
In conjunction with the appointing authority, the Department of Administration
will schedule a hearing with the employee and supervisor for both parties to
present their issues, and the appointing authority will determine the outcome
of the hearing.
      (3)   When the appointing authorities have reviewed the evaluations to
ensure consistency and fairness, they should be given to the Department of
Administration. The Finance office will then be notified of any increases to be
awarded.
   (c)   The Performance Appraisal Form.
      (1)   The performance appraisal process begins with a written evaluation
which is based on a detailed review of job performance. The form consists of
two parts.
         A.   The General Performance Factors. The factors include the
following:
            1.   Quality of Work.
            2.   Quantity of Work.
            3.   Cooperation/Team Work.
            4.   Job Knowledge.
            5.   Dependability.
            6.   Communication.
            7.   Judgement/Problem Solving.
            8.   Initiative.
            9.   Knowledge of Department Policy and Objectives.
            10.   Adhering to Safety Procedures.
            11.   Attendance/Tardiness.
         B.   The Special Factors. The second part consists of Special
Performance Factors which represent critical areas of performance unique to
each position. The Special Factors are different for each position, although
there may be some overlap between similar jobs to incorporate some consistency
in the form. The employee and the supervisor developed the factors with
guidance from Human Resources.
   (d)   Merit Pay Calculations.
      (1)   The two parts of the form will have equal value in the quantitative
summary of the evaluation. The general factors and the special factors will be
added together and divided by the total numbers of factors available.
      (2)   Merit pay increases will be calculated on the following scale using
the annual wage adjustment approved by Council as the base for all
calculations.
         A.   1.0-2.5 rating will receive 0% of the Wage Adjustment.
         B.   2.6-2.7 rating will receive 50% of the Wage Adjustment.
         C.   2.8-3.3 rating will receive 100% of the Wage Adjustment.
         D.   3.4-3.6 rating will receive 125% of the Wage Adjustment.
         E.   3.7-3.9 rating will receive 150% of the Wage Adjustment.
         F.   4.0-5.0 rating will receive 200% of the Wage Adjustment.
      (3)   The percentage increase will be calculated on the employee’s

reorganization of any such employer does not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of such business to make the return
and/or or pay taxes, penalties, or interest due.
   (h)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary an amended return must be filed in order to report

the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer’s City tax liability, the taxpayer shall make

upon the final determination of federal tax liability and pay any additional
tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
         (Ord. 13-2007. Passed 1-25-07.)
181.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer within or doing business within the City of Tallmadge
who employs one or more persons shall, at the time of the payment thereto,
without regard to any alleged credit, deduction, or exemption available under
local, state, or federal statute, deduct the amount of tax due based upon the
rate in effect at that time from the qualifying wages, commissions, income, or
other compensation earned by the City of Tallmadge residents, regardless of
where such compensation was earned, and shall deduct the amount of tax due
based upon the rate in effect at the time of payment from the qualifying wages,
commissions, income, or other compensation earned within the City of Tallmadge
by nonresidents. For purposes of calculating taxes to be withheld from
nonresident employees, the employer shall determine the amount of gross wages
and other compensation allocable to the City of Tallmadge pursuant to Ohio R.C.
718.02. The employer shall consistently allocate the employer's gross income in
the same manner. This determination shall be prima facie evidence of where the
taxpayer-employee's compensation was earned and may be rebutted only upon
submission of tax returns filed in other jurisdictions or such other evidence
satisfactory to the Tax Administrator. The withheld tax shall be remitted as
follows:
      (1)   Quarterly payments of tax withheld are required if the total amount
of tax withheld by an employer in the prior calendar year averaged less than
one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month.
      (2)   Monthly payments of tax withheld are required if the average amount
of tax withheld by an employer in the prior calendar year is equal to or
greater than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month, but does not exceed one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per month.
      (3)   Semimonthly payments of tax withheld are required if the average
amount of tax withheld by an employer in the prior calendar year exceeds one
thousand dollars ($1000.00) per month. At the discretion of the taxpayer,
payments may be submitted more frequently than semimonthly.
(Ord. 13-2007. Passed 1-25-07.)
   (b)   Every employer, in collecting said tax, shall be deemed to hold the
same, until payment is made by such employer to the City of Tallmadge as a
Trustee for the benefit of the City of Tallmadge. Any such tax collected by
such employer from its employees shall, until the same is paid to the City of
Tallmadge, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer.
      (1)   Subject to rules of the Tax Administrator, every employer required
to deduct and withhold any amount under this chapter shall make payment by
electronic funds transfer or by election to pay through the Ohio Business
Gateway (OBG), subject to subsection (b)(4) below.
      (2)   The payment of taxes by electronic funds transfer or through the
OBG does not affect an employer’s obligation to file the returns as required
under this chapter. The Tax Administrator may adopt rules governing the format
for filing the returns under this section by employers who remit undeposited
taxes by electronic funds transfer or through the OBG. The rules may permit the
filing of returns at less frequent intervals than required hereunder if the Tax
Administrator determines that remittance by electronic funds transfer or
through the OBG warrants less frequent filing of returns.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator shall adopt rules governing the remittance of
taxes by electronic funds transfer as required under this chapter. The rules
shall govern the modes of electronic funds transfer and under what
circumstances each mode is acceptable, the content and format of electronic
funds transfers, the coordination by payment of electronic funds transfer, and
the filing of associated tax reports and returns, and any other related matter
that in the discretion of the Tax Administrator, facilitates payment by
electronic funds transfer.
      (4)   The Tax Administrator may grant an exemption to an employer from
the duty to make payment by electronic funds transfer based upon a
demonstration of substantial hardship to the employer. Additionally, the Tax
Administrator may establish a priority of electronic payors based upon the
number of employees or the utilization third party payroll administrators in
order to phase in this requirement.
      (5)   The Tax Administrator may implement a means of acknowledging, upon
request of a taxpayer, receipt of tax remittances made by electronic funds
transfer, and may adapt rules governing acknowledgments. The cost of
acknowledging receipt of electronic remittances shall be paid by the person
requesting acknowledgment.
         (Ord. 17-2008. Passed 2-14-08.)
   (c)   Such returns shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable
to the Tax Administrator and shall be subject to the rules and regulations
prescribed therefore by the Tax Administrator. Such employer shall be liable
for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not
such taxes have in fact been withheld.
 
   (d)   The officer or employee having control or supervision, or charged with
the responsibility of withholding the tax, filing the return and/or making the
payment, shall be personally liable for the failure to file the return or pay
the tax due as required herein. The dissolution, bankruptcy, or reorganization
of any such employer does not discharge an officer's or employee's liability
for a prior failure of such business to file a return or pay taxes due.
   (e)   (1)   On or before February 28 of each year, each employer shall file
a withholding return setting forth the name, address, and social security
number of all employees from whose compensation the tax was withheld during the
preceding calendar year and the amount of tax withheld from his employees and
such other information as may be required by the Tax administrator.
      (2)   On or before February 28 of each year all individuals, businesses,
employers, brokers or others who engage persons, either on a fee or commission
basis or as independent contractors and not employees (i.e., those who are not
subject to withholding) must provide the Tax Administrator with copies of all
1099 Miscellaneous Income Forms and/or a list of names, addresses, Social
Security numbers and a total amount of earnings, payments, bonuses, commissions
and/or fees paid to each person.
         (Ord. 13-2007. Passed 1-25-07.)

first day of January in the year in which they became subject to estimated

   (a)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized employee, is hereby
authorized to examine the books, papers, records, and federal and State income

181.11 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENT.
   (a)   All taxes imposed by this Chapter shall be collectible, together with
any interest and penalties. All additional assessments shall be made and all
actions to recover municipal income taxes and penalties and interest thereon
shall be brought within three years after the tax was due or the return was
filed, whichever is later. However, In the case of fraud, omission of 25% or
more of income subject to this tax, or failure to file a return, all additional
assessments shall be made and all prosecutions to recover Municipal income
taxes and penalties and interest thereon shall be brought within six (6) years
after the tax was due or the return was filed, whichever is later. In those
cases in which a Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the taxpayer have
executed a waiver of the federal statute of limitations, the period within
which all additional assessment may be made by the Tax Administrator shall be
one (1) year from the time of the final determination of the federal tax
liability.
   (b)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for refund
is made within three (3) years from the date that such payment was made or the
return was due or within three (3) months after final determination of the
federal tax liability, whichever is later. In addition, the following shall
apply regarding refunds of tax withheld from non-qualified deferred
compensation plans (NDCP):
      (1)   A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from a NDCP. The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to the NDCP. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP.
      (2)   A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from a NDCP,
and that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP and upon
which municipal tax was withheld, then a refund will be issued on the amount
representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed and the
income received from the NDCP. If different tax rates applied to the tax years
in which deferrals, a weighted average of the different tax rates will be used
to compute the refund amount.
      (3)   Refunds shall be allowed only if the loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee’s
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer’s terms and conditions
necessary to receive the nonqualified compensation.
   (c)   Income tax that has been deposited with the City of Tallmadge, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City
of Tallmadge as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on
refunds. Income tax that should have been deposited with the City of Tallmadge,
but was deposited with another municipality, shall be subject to recovery by
the City of Tallmadge. The City of Tallmadge will allow a non- refundable
credit for any amount owed the City of Tallmadge that is in excess of the
amount to be refunded by the other municipality, as long as the tax rate of the
other municipality is the same or higher than the City of Tallmadge tax rate.
If the City of Tallmadge tax rate is higher, the tax representing the net
difference of the rates is also subject to collection by the City of Tallmadge.

other compensation, and on net profits as hereinafter provided in Section
182.03 and other sections as they may apply.
      (2)    In addition to the tax levied in Section
182.01(B)(1), the annual tax is levied at an additional rate of .25% (one-

Withholding provisions.
   (A)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in City shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages earned
and/or received by each employee in City. Except for qualifying wages for which
withholding is not required under Section
182.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
182.03 of this chapter. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall
deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the
employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays
the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the
employee. (Ord. 53-2019. Passed 11-14-19.) 
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of City the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld or
the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent,
or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of City in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the total
amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld
on behalf of City in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200.
      Payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to the
Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month for
which the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (c)    Notwithstanding the provisions of Section (B)(1)(a)and (b) of
this section, taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
semimonthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld
or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of City in the preceding
calendar year exceeded $11,999, or if in any month of the preceding calendar
year exceeded $1,000. Payment under division (B)(1)(c) of this section shall be
made to the Tax Administrator not later than one of the following: (i) if the
taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld during
the first fifteen days of a month, the third banking day after the fifteenth
day of that month; (ii) if the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to
be deducted and withheld after the fifteenth day of a month and before the
first day of the immediately following month, the third banking day after the
last day of the month.
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of City. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and City as the return required
of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this
chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold City income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to City the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to City
income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the deferred
compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the deferred
compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for City until such time as the withheld amount
is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for City during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold City income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under
the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section
Occasional Entrant - Withholding.

If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal

section, an employer is not required to withhold City income tax on qualifying
wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in City if
the employee performed such services in City on 20 or fewer days in a calendar
year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in City.
            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in City. For the purposes of this division, "presumed

City at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a
calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last

commence:
               (a)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to

the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided in
Section
182.04.
            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in City
only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf of
the employer in City than in any other municipal corporation on that day. For
the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)    Traveling from any location to another location in order

employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in City exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer shall
withhold and remit tax to City for any subsequent days in that calendar year on
which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal services
performed in City.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for City under
division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for City for the
first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in City.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is City and the employer qualifies
as a small employer as defined in Section
182.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to City,
regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of City.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, a the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
182.04.

      (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section

an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due City.
      (2)    Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for City income tax
purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which

the case of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation,
Ohio form IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other
documentation necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return.
An individual taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section
electronically is not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing
to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies
after the return has been filed.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the

      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or

a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)   (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be

automatically receive an extension for the filing of City's income tax return.
The extended due date of City's income tax return shall be the 15th day of the
tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
An extension of time to file under this division is not an extension of the
time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of City's income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's City income tax return. If the
request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the City
income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's
requested extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a
City's income tax return. The extended due date of City's income tax return
shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.

ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to City for a taxable year
pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with City an annual net
profit return under division (F)(3) of this section, unless the provisions of
division (H)(3) apply
      (3)   (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the City income tax ordinance for a
taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)   The person was required to file a tax return with the City

services at a worksite location (as defined in Section
182.04(C)(1)(g)) within the City.
            (ii)    The person no longer provides services in the City and does
not expect to be subject to the City income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that

previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the City. The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within the City, make any sales in the City, or otherwise become subject to the
tax levied by the City during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the City for the taxable year, the affiant agrees
to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the City
income tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b) the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return
for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)   Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)    If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the City by an employer, the agent of an employer,
or other payer as described in Section
182.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by City, unless the amounts withheld were not remitted
to City and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in
connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by City to be filed in accordance with this
division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by City, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by City or
the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter
and of City's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations governing the
filing of returns, reports, or documents.

filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the

withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of City for
both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by City during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.

division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or

         (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)    For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this

Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated

purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (R)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in

   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to City's income
tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations filed a
consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable year. The
election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first taxable
year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to City. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated City income
tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated City income tax return
for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives
written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a
taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated City income tax return in the

federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
182.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return shall
make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
182.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not
be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to City;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to City income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated City income tax return shall make
the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
182.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by City in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with City before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated or
combined tax return with City may continue to file consolidated or combined tax
returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable years
beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

182.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in City who is required to and
does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed the tax due City under this chapter.
   (B)    City shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident of
City who works in a joint economic development zone created under Section
715.691 or a joint economic development district created under Section 715.70,
715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it grants a credit against
its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another municipal
corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (D)    Intentionally left blank.
(Ord. 64-2015. Passed 10-8-15.)
182.07 ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for City from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the City in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the

provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to City, including the
application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before the
applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability
for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5) percent of

first month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year. For a person other than an individual, on or

shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section 718.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
182.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;

estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is

payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
City under Section
182.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in City but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.

182.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
182.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars or more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been

      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
182.18 (A)(4).

182.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.

deposited with another municipality, is allowable by City as a refund but is
subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with City is subject to recovery by City. If City's tax on

withholding paid to the other municipality, City shall allow a nonrefundable
credit against the tax or withholding City claims is due with respect to such
income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipality
with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)    If City's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using City's
tax rate. However, if City's tax rate is greater than the tax rate in the other
municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is to be paid
to City, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during the period of
nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 64-2015. Passed 10-8-15.)
182.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for City changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with City.
The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten

facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
182.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of
Section
182.12 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by City. A request filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
182.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended City return showing income subject to City

liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional City income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars.

holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the board of Tax Review, the sixtieth

   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the

the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by City does not prejudice any claim
for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
182.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
182.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover City income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:

proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 64-2015. Passed 10-8-15.)
182.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other City official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City official,
or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division prevents
the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with
the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the local
board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 64-2015. Passed 10-8-15.)
182.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to City that arises pursuant to City's income tax imposed in accordance with
this chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 64-2015. Passed 10-8-15.)
182.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of City as authorized
by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may furnish copies
of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and other related tax
information to the internal revenue service, the tax commissioner, and tax
administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit City from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 64-2015. Passed 10-8-15.)
182.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by City ordinance or state law to be
filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud City or the Tax Administrator.

   (A)    As used in this section:

      (5)    "Return" includes any tax return, report, reconciliation,
schedule, and other document required to be filed with a the Tax Administrator
or City by a taxpayer, employer, any agent of the employer, or any other payer
pursuant to applicable law, including at any time before January 1, 2016.

   (B)   (1)    This section applies to the following:
         (a)    Any return required to be filed under applicable law for
taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         (b)    Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to City on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
City to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (C)    Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer
for any reason fail, in whole or in part, to make timely and full payment or

timely with the City any return required to be filed, the following penalties

imposed or collected before January 1, 2016.

(Ord. 104-2017. Passed 1-25-18.)
182.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)    Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the ORC:
      (1)   (a)    Exercise all powers whatsoever of an query nature as
provided by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records,
memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         (b)    The powers referred to in this division of this section shall
be exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance
of the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under City's
income tax ordinance;
      (2)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)    Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and

respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)    Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax
Administrator finds that there has been an overpayment, make a written

computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made.
         (b)    If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-
determine, or correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order
which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the
withholding obligations described in Section

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
      (2)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or

subject to, the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by City or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.
Identification information.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
182.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
182.99.
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
182.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
182.18.
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
182.99 for a violation of Section
182.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

   (C)    A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (D)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.

subject to appeal.

direct subordinate thereof.
      (2)    The term for members of the Board of Tax Review City shall be two

administrative official.
      (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.
      (4)    A member of the Board of Tax Review who, for any reason, ceases to
meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
      (6)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons
why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.
(Ord. 64-2015. Passed 10-8-15.)
182.22 AUTHORITY TO CREATE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the legislative authority of City,
or a Tax Administrator pursuant to authority granted to the administrator by
resolution or ordinance, to adopt rules to administer an income tax imposed by
City in accordance with this chapter. Such rules shall not conflict with or be
inconsistent with any provision of this chapter. Taxpayers are hereby required
to comply not only with the requirements of this chapter, but also to comply
with the Rules and Regulations.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on

defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or
private agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of
the person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any

vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this subsection may recover the

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the

submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall
withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s

notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a

under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
               The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the
three-day jail term under this subsection if it places the offender under a
community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three
days, requires the offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a
drivers’ intervention program so certified, and sentences the offender to a
jail term equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days that the
offender does not spend attending the program. The court may require the
offender, as a condition of community control and in addition to the required
attendance at a drivers’ intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily
complete any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum
standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental
Health and Addiction Services that the operators of the drivers’ intervention
program determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to
the court on the offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose
on the offender any other conditions of community control that it considers
necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
               The court may require the offender, under a community control
sanction imposed under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete
any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum standards
adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and
Addiction Services, in addition to the required attendance at drivers’
intervention program, that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program
determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to the
court on the offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose any
other conditions of community control on the offender that it considers
necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy- five dollars
($1,075).

commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten- day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community

determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty- day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,

construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs equipped with
flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the hours in which
the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:

have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof. If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared

the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s

section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer's view of the interior or visual
inspection of a motor vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not

occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:

conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,

Municipality for purposes of this section.

         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a

         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 COSTS OF CONFINEMENT.
   (a)   Any person who is convicted of an offense under any section of the
Codified Ordinances of the City of Tallmadge or any section of the Ohio Revised
Code, other than a minor misdemeanor, and who is sentenced to and imprisoned in
the Summit, Medina or Portage County Jail, or other facility shall reimburse
the City of Tallmadge for its expenses incurred by reason of the prisoner’s
confinement to the extent allowed by Ohio R.C. 2929.223.
   (b)   The duty to reimburse the City shall include all expenses incurred by

include any period of incarceration before sentencing that is credited against
the term of imprisonment and up to two hours of overtime costs the City
incurred relating to the trial of the person.
   (c)   In any proceeding which is subject to this section, the Director of
Law shall apply to the sentencing judge or magistrate for a determination, or
the sentencing judge or magistrate may, on his own motion proceed to make a
determination of the extent of the individual’s duty to reimburse the City for
its expenses in confining him, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.223. However, the
maximum amount permitted by Ohio R.C. 2929.223 shall not apply. The actual
amount to be paid shall not exceed the actual costs of confinement. The
Prosecutor shall notify the Clerk of Courts in all cases where the sentencing
judge or magistrate determines the individual has a duty to reimburse the City,
and shall include the amount so ordered to be paid in such notice.
   (d)   The Police Chief shall maintain records of expenses chargeable to each
prisoner, in accordance with a reasonable computation of the per capita cost of
maintaining such prisoner, in addition to specific expense incurred on behalf
of each prisoner. Upon each prisoner’s release, the Police Chief shall prepare
a statement of such expense, and, in the event such expense equals or exceeds
fifty dollars ($50.00), he shall cause such statement to be transmitted to the
Director of Law.
   (e)   Upon receipt of both a statement which indicates a total expense of
fifty dollars ($50.00) or more from the Police Department as to any individual
formerly incarcerated, the Director of Law shall then apply to the court for
the reimbursement if not previously ordered. The Clerk may, in his discretion,
accept partial payments, or permit individuals to make periodic payments.

no acceptable response is made, the Clerk shall refer such matters to the City
of Tallmadge Law Department for further collection efforts.
   (f)   The Clerk shall also refer matters to the Law Department for
additional collection efforts where an individual fails to satisfactorily
complete a payment plan or where a private collection agency has been unable to
collect costs in matters referred to it. The Director of Law in all matters
referred to him, shall determine the most appropriate procedure for collecting
such unpaid expenses. All moneys collected pursuant to this section shall be
placed only in the General Fund of the City.

commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.

only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.

a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
(3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and the
physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to its
former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal property,
is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind and
quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2909.11)

   (b)   (1)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause
or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that
is not an occupied structure;
      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

726.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   Purpose. That the purpose of this Chapter is to establish reasonable
and uniform regulations to minimize and control the negative effects of
amusement arcades within the City in order to promote the health, safety and
welfare of the citizens of the City. It is not the purpose or intent of this
Chapter to restrict or deny access to recreational and skilled-based amusement
machines.
   (b)   Findings.
      (1)   The State of Ohio currently allows certain games of skill while
games of chance are deemed illegal. Based upon experience within the City,
certain arcades identified as operating games of skill, have generated various
complaints by citizens involving thefts, questionable pay practices,
considerable sums of cash being transacted, food management concerns, fire code
and access, and other issues of compliance with local and state laws.
      (2)   These businesses are located throughout the City in general
business districts, in areas which attract adults and children. It is the
specific finding that games of skill operated electronically, may easily be
altered to illegal games of chance. Further, that the City has a duty to its
citizens to require businesses open to the public to maintain safe ingress and
egress, to maintain adequate security where a considerable volume of cash is
transacted, and to otherwise operate within the bounds of the law.  
(Ord. 50-2006. Passed 9-14-06.)

760.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   Purpose. That the purpose of this Chapter is to establish reasonable
and uniform regulations to minimize and control the negative secondary effects
of sexually oriented businesses within the City in order to promote the health,
safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City. The provisions of this Chapter
have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction
on the content of any communicative materials or communication, including
sexually oriented entertainment. Similarly, it is not the purpose or effect of
this Chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented
entertainment protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Furthermore, it is not the intent or effect of this Chapter to
condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of entertainment that is
obscene.
   (b)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of sexually oriented businesses on the community presented in hearings before
the Council; on findings incorporated in the cases of the City of Renton v.
Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theaters,
427 U.S. 50 (1976); and on studies in other cities including New York, New
York; Islip, New York; Los Angeles, California; Indianapolis, Indiana;
Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; and Phoenix, Arizona; along with Manatee
County, Florida; New Hanover County, North Carolina; and the State of
Minnesota; this Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities.
      (2)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-
private booths or rooms for viewing films, videos, or live sexually-oriented
entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases
such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
      (3)   Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that
encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions.
      (4)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate
those activities and maintain their facilities.
      (5)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented
films.
      (6)   The findings noted in paragraphs number 1 through 5 raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (7)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (8)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of
sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a
heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented
businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare
of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the City. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the sexually oriented business, and fully in possession and control
of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (9)   The regulation of nudity in sexually oriented businesses will
further the substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution and
other sex- related crimes, including illegal sex acts, and protecting the
public health, safety, and welfare.
      (10)   Removal of doors and/or curtains on viewing booths in sexually
oriented businesses and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing
booths will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing the
illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult arcades and theaters
and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other
federal, state, and local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental
interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (11)   Requiring sufficient lighting in all sexually oriented businesses
will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing illegal activity
on the premises of sexually oriented businesses, and will facilitate
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state, and
local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (12)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of sexually oriented
businesses, and by employees of such businesses, will facilitate the
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state, and
local laws, and will thereby further the substantial government interest in
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (13)    A person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related
crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually
oriented business or adult motel.
      (14)   Barring such individuals from the management of and employment in
sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and
prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts, including conduct
which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.

affirming or reversing the denial, suspension, or revocation within five (5)
days after the hearing.
   (b)   Such Adult Business Licensing Appeals Board shall consist of five (5)
residents of the City, appointed by the Mayor, for terms of four years. Such
Board shall determine whether the denial of any license under this chapter was

applicant or licensee may seek prompt judicial review of such administrative
action in any court of competent jurisdiction.
   (d)   In the event that an applicant or licensee seeks judicial review of a
decision issued pursuant to this Ordinance, the applicant or licensee shall
provide written notice of such appeal to the Board in advance of or at the time
of the filing of the appeal. Within ten (10) days of receiving such written
notice of appeal, or within such shorter time as may be ordered by the court,
the Board shall transmit to the court in which appeal was sought a copy of the
full administrative record for the matter, including a complete transcript of
all the original papers, testimony and evidence offered, heard, and taken into
consideration in issuing the final order. The Board and all other departments
or agencies of the City shall provide any further information, assistance, or
cooperation requested by the reviewing court within 72 hours of such request.
   (e)   Subject to the provisions of subsection (g) of this section, any
licensee lawfully operating a sexually oriented business or adult motel prior
to the denial of a license renewal application, or the suspension or revocation
of a license, may continue to operate said business during the pendency of an
appeal of a decision rendered under this Board or to a court.
   (f)   Subject to the provisions of subsection (g) of this section, any
licensee lawfully acting as an employee in a sexually oriented business or
adult motel prior to the denial of a license renewal application, or the
suspension or revocation of a license, may continue to serve in such capacity
during the pendency of an appeal of a decision rendered under this Board or to
a court.
   (g)   In the event that an applicant for a new sexually oriented business
license or a new sexually oriented business employee license seeks judicial
review of the denial of a new license, and such review does not result in a
final judicial decision within thirty (30) days of the date the appeal was
filed, the City shall issue such applicant a provisional sexually oriented
business license or sexually oriented business employee license upon request of
the applicant. The provisional license:
      (1)   Allows an applicant for a sexually oriented business license to
operate the sexually oriented business or adult motel named in the license
application under the same terms as a normal sexually oriented business issued
pursuant to Section
760.07 of this chapter for the period of time specified in subparagraph (h) of
this section; and
      (2)   Allows an applicant for a sexually oriented business employee
license to act as an employee on the premises of a sexually oriented business
or adult motel under the same terms as a normal sexually oriented business
employee license issued pursuant to Section
760.09 of this chapter for the period of time specified in subparagraph (h) of
this section; and
      (3)   Allows an applicant to be subject to the same requirements as a
normal sexually oriented business license or sexually oriented business
employee license issued under Section
760.07 or Section
760.09 of this chapter.
   (h)   A provisional license will expire on whichever of the following three
dates is earliest:
      (1)   The date that a judicial decision is issued upholding the license
denial;
      (2)   The date on which a non-provisional sexually oriented business
license or sexually oriented business employee license is issued to the
applicant pursuant to a judicial decision overturning the license denial; or
      (3)   The date one year from the issuance of the provisional license.
   (i)   In the event that judicial review of the denial of a new license
application is still pending thirty (30) days before the expiration date of a
provisional license, the provisional licensee may file a renewal license
application with the Safety Director pursuant to Section
760.12(b) of this chapter. The Safety Director shall grant an application for
renewal of a provisional license unless he determines that new grounds exist
for denial of a license application pursuant to Section
760.07 or Section
760.09 of this chapter, which did not exist at the time of the original license
application. In the event that an application for renewal of a provisional
license is denied and the applicant seeks judicial review of that denial, the
City has the right to consolidate such review with the pending judicial appeal
of the previous license denial.

one licensee to another, but the use of the license by the individual to whom

license, provided that the licensee gives written notice of such transfer to
the Director of Public Safety within fifteen (15) days of such transfer.

motel as that term is defined in Section
760.02 of this chapter.
   (c)   Evidence that a person in control of a sleeping room in a hotel,
motel, or similar commercial establishment has rented or subrented a sleeping

905.01 OPENINGS; PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person, firm or corporation shall make any opening or excavation in any
street, highway, alley, sidewalk or public way or cut into any curb within the
City unless a permit to make such opening or cutting shall have been obtained
prior to commencement of the work, as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 177-1963. Passed 12-19-63.)
905.02 APPLICATION; DEPOSIT.
   Each permit for making such opening or curb cutting shall be confined to a

administrative officer. Application shall be made on a form prescribed by the
Director, giving the exact location of the proposed opening or cutting; the
kind of paving, the area and depth to be excavated and such other facts as the
Director may deem necessary. The permit shall be issued only after a cash
deposit or bond sufficient to cover the cost of restoration, as determined by
the Director, has been deposited with the Director, conditioned upon prompt and
satisfactory refilling of excavations and restoration of all surfaces or curbs
disturbed. The fee for such permit, payable prior to issuance of the permit,

(Ord. 57-2001. Passed 5-24-01.)
905.03 WAIVER OF DEPOSIT.
   The requirements of Section
905.02 shall be waived insofar as public utilities doing their own work with

portion thereof or on any other property of the City that may be involved. This
waiver, however, shall not apply when the work is being done by private
contractors under contract to the utilities.
(Ord. 27-1957. Passed 3-15-57.)
905.04 RETURN OF DEPOSIT.

905.06 METHOD OF OPENING STREET; TUNNELING.
   In opening any street or public way all materials for paving and ballasting
must be removed with the least possible injury or loss of the same and,
together with excavated material from the trench, must be placed where they
will cause the least practicable inconvenience to the public. As little as
possible of the trench shall be dug until the junction piece in the water or
sewer line is found, unless it is first determined that a new opening into the
line be made. Whenever the sides of the trenches will not stand perpendicular
sheeting, braces must be used to prevent unnecessary caving, and in no case
shall the work be done by tunneling, unless authorized and directed by the
Service Director.

precautions as shall be necessary to guard the public against accidents. At all
times the work shall be done as to cause the least inconvenience to the
property owners and the general public.
(Ord. 177-1963. Passed 12-19-63.)
905.08 RESTORATION OF PAVEMENT.
   (a)   The restoration of pavement or other surface shall be performed under
the direction and to the satisfaction of the Service Director.
   (b)   The backfilling over the drains, sewers or other utility lines, after
they have been laid and accepted by the proper official, shall be done by hand
with fine material and tamped to a point one foot above the top of the utility
line or pipe. Above this point, backfill shall be in layers not more than eight
inches thick and compacted by rolling or flushing or a combination of both
methods, as directed by the Service Director. All paving which is removed must
be replaced within forty-eight hours after the completion of the work in the
excavation, unless instructed otherwise by the Director. The restoration shall
be done so as to make the pavement at least as good as it was before it was
disturbed. The contractor shall be responsible for any subsequent settlement of
the ground or pavement. All water lines must be protected from settlement or
injury. All gas lines, oil lines and telephone conduits shall be protected.
   (c)   Upon failure or refusal of the permittee satisfactorily to fill the
excavation, restore the surface and remove all excess materials within the time
specified in the permit, or where not specified therein, within a reasonable
time after commencement of the work, the City may proceed without notice to
make such fill and restoration and the cost thereof shall be deducted from the
deposit posted under Section
905.02. If the cost of such restoration should exceed the amount of such
deposit, the proper officer of the City shall proceed to collect the remainder
due from such permittee and no permit shall be subsequently granted until such
amounts are paid.

prevent or significantly impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil.
Typical impervious surface areas include, but are not limited to: roofs,
sidewalks, walkways, patios, swimming pools, private driveways, parking lots,
access extensions, alleys and other paved, engineered, compacted or gravel
surfaces containing materials that prevent or significantly impede the natural
infiltration of stormwater into the soil.
   (h)   "Natural state" shall describe existing land, water, soil, and

City, including all land areas legally annexed thereto.
   (j)   "Service charge" shall mean a stormwater management service charge,
applicable to a zoning lot or tract, that generally reflects the impact on or
demand for stormwater management services provided by the City to properly
control and manage stormwater runoff quantity and/or quality associated with
the zoning lot or tract. The service charge will vary from one zoning lot or
tract to another, based on the impervious surface area.
   (k)   "Stormwater" shall mean the runoff from precipitation that travels
over natural state or developed land surfaces and enters a drainage system.
   (l)   "Stormwater management program" shall mean an identified set of

natural state to an extent that results in 200 or more square feet of
impervious surface area.
   (p)   "Zoning lot" shall mean a legally subdivided lot (not a tract) shown
on a legally recorded plat or deed, or a combination of such legally subdivided
and recorded adjacent lots. (Ord. 2022-76. Passed 11-10-22.)

from any requirement of the certificate of registration process that is in
direct conflict with the requirements of, and/or specifically exempted by, a

part of a system found in Rights-of-Way for which a Certificate of Registration

Way so long as each such Provider complies with the provisions of this chapter.

Certificate of Registration does not excuse a Provider from obtaining
appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before locating its Facilities
on Facilities of others, including the City's Facilities. A Certificate of
Registration does not prevent a Provider from leasing space in or on the
Provider's System, so long as the sharing of Facilities does not cause a
violation of law, including the provisions of this chapter. A Certificate of
Registration does not excuse a Provider from complying with any provisions of
the Code or other applicable law.

chapter, manage, administer and control the Rights-of-Way and maintain each
Certificate of Registration issued, every Provider or any Person operating a
System or otherwise using and occupying the Rights-of-Way shall pay to the City
a Registration Maintenance Fee. The Registration Maintenance Fee shall be
determined and assessed to Providers and other Persons operating a System or
otherwise using and occupying the Rights-of-Way as an annual fee, for each

   (c)    Taxes and Assessments. To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by any taxing authority or community authority on the use of City
property as a result of a Provider's use or occupation of the Rights-of-Way,
the Provider shall be responsible for payment of such taxes or assessments.
Such payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to this
chapter and shall not be considered an offset to, or in lieu of, the fees and
charges listed in this chapter. The Registration Maintenance Fee is not in lieu
of any tax, fee, or other assessment except as specifically provided in this
chapter, or as required by applicable law.
   (d)    Interest on Late Payments. In the event that any Registration
Maintenance Fee is not paid to the City by April 1, the Provider shall pay a
monthly late charge of one percent (5%) of the unpaid balance for each month or
any portion thereof for which payment is not made. Late payments on
Registration Maintenance Fees may result in the denial of future Right-of-Way
permits.
   (e)    No Accord and Satisfaction. No acceptance by the City of any
Registration Maintenance Fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount
paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such
Registration Maintenance Fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the
City may have for additional sums payable.

replacement of a Small Cell Facility and/or Wireless Support Structure with a
Small Cell Facility and/ or Wireless Support Structure, respectively, that is
consistent with the City's Design Guidelines and is substantially similar to
the existing Small Cell Facility and/ or Wireless Support Structure, or the
same size or smaller than the existing Small Cell Facility and/ or Wireless
Support Structure and complies with the requirements for Construction Permits
as provided in this chapter.
      (1)    For processing a Micro Wireless Permit Application, the City may
charge a fee of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) for each Small Cell
Facility and/or Wireless Support Structure. The City may adjust this charge ten
per cent every five years, rounded to the nearest five dollars.
      (2)    The City shall grant or deny a Micro Wireless Permit in accordance
with any required timelines under Law.
         A.    If the City fails to approve or deny a Micro Wireless Permit
within the required time period, provided that the time period is not otherwise
tolled in accordance with the provisions of this section, the Micro Wireless
Permit shall be deemed granted upon the requesting entity notifying the City
that the time period for granting or denying the request for consent has
lapsed.
      (3)    Requests for consent that do not meet the requirements listed on
the Micro Wireless Permit Application or stated herein or in the City's Design
Guidelines shall be deemed incomplete or shall otherwise denied by the City.
         A.    If a Micro Wireless Permit is deemed incomplete, the City shall
provide written notice to the Applicant that clearly and specifically
delineates all missing documents or required information.
            1.    Once the Applicant submits the documents or information in
response to the City's notice of incompleteness, the City shall, within sixty
(60) calendar days, grant, deny, or deem the Micro Wireless Permit to be
incomplete due to not providing the information identified in the original
notice of incompleteness.
            2.    For a Micro Wireless Permit that is deemed incomplete for a
second or subsequent time, the City shall continue to follow the process in
subsection (e)(3)A.1. of this section until such time that a complete

writing its reasons for denying the request, supported by substantial,
competent evidence, and such information at the Applicant may reasonably
request to obtain consent.

Communications Policy Act of 1984," 98 Stat. 2779, 47 U.S.C.A. 541, the City,
for good cause shown, may withhold, deny, or delay its consent to any Person
based upon the Person's failure to possess the financial, technical, and
managerial resources necessary to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare.
      (4)    The City shall permit a Person seeking to Construct, modify,
collocate, or replace more than one Small Cell Facility or more than one

Right-of-Way.
         B.    A single Application may only address multiple Small Cell
Facilities or Wireless Support Structures if they each involve substantially
the same type of Small Cell Facility and/or substantially the same type of
Wireless Support Structure.
         C.    The Director of Public Service may separately address
Applications for which incomplete information has been received or which are
denied.
      (5)    If the number of requests for consent is likely to result in
difficulty processing Applications within the time limits set forth in Law due
to the lack of resources of the City, then the City may toll the time limits as
follows:
         A.    The time period for the City to grant or deny a Micro Wireless
Permit may be tolled for up to twenty-one (21) days for the first fifteen (15)
requests for consent for Small Cell Facilities or Wireless Support Structures

five years, rounded to the nearest five dollars.
   (g)    The City's approval term of a Collocation to a Wireless Support
Structure shall be for a period of not less than ten (10) years, with a
presumption of renewal for successive five-year terms, unless otherwise
terminated or not renewed for cause or by mutual agreement between the Operator
and the City.

appearance of a Wireless Support Structure, including any height requirements
adopted by the City.
      (1)    The City, as opposed to the Construction of a new Wireless Support
Structure in the Right-of-Way, shall prefer co-locating Small Cell Facilities
on existing Wireless Support Structures without increasing the Height of the
Wireless Support Structure by more than five (5) feet, including the Antenna
and any associated shroud or concealment material.
      (2)    The City shall allow, consistent with Law and for the purpose of
providing Wireless Service, Collocation of a Small Cell Facility by an Operator

any reasonable terms and conditions for such Collocation that are adopted by
the City and consistent with the Design Guidelines and this chapter.

a new Wireless Support Structure that is within one hundred (100) feet of the
proposed location or within a distance that is equivalent to the width of the
Right-of-Way in or on which the new Wireless Support Structure is proposed,
whichever is greater, which the Operator shall use if it has the right to use
the alternate location on reasonable terms and conditions and the alternate
location does not impose technical limits or additional costs.

whose Facilities are being Constructed.
         K.    When a Construction Permit is requested for purposes of
installing additional Systems or any part of a System, the posting of a bond,
acceptable to the City and subject to this chapter, for the additional Systems
or any part of a System is required.
         L.    Upon request, the Director of Public Service may modify or waive
the information requirements if they are not necessary in evaluating the
Construction Permit application. The Director of Public Service may request
applicable and pertinent additional information if it is necessary in
evaluating the Construction Permit Application.
   (c)    Issuance of Permit; Conditions.
      (1)    If the City determines that the Applicant has satisfied the
requirements of this chapter and the Construction Permit process, the Director
of Public Service shall issue a Construction Permit subject to the provisions
of subsection (c)(2) hereof.
      (2)    The City may impose reasonable conditions upon the issuance of the
Construction Permit and the performance of the Permittee thereunder in order to
protect the City's investment in the Right-of-Way, protect the public health,
safety and welfare, to insure the structural integrity of the Rights-of-Way, to
protect the property and safety of other users of the Rights-of-Way, or to
minimize the disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public.
   (d)    Construction Permit Fees.
      (1)    The City shall collect a Construction Permit Fee as set forth in
the Rules and Regulations to reimburse the City for the cost incurred by the
City that is associated with receiving, reviewing, processing and granting (or
denying) the Construction Permit and any oversight of the Construction Permit
or the Construction work associated therewith. The Permittee
shall remit payment to the City for the original invoice at least ten (10) days
in advance of beginning Construction. Any Applicant who begins Construction
without timely remitting such invoiced Construction Permit Fee amounts shall be
subject to the penalties of this chapter, the imposition of any other legal or
equitable remedies available to the City and the immediate revocation of any
Certificate of Registration or Construction Permit having been issued.
      (2)    The City may, in addition to the costs listed in subsection (d){'
{'}l), include in the Construction Permit Fee the cost of the value of
degradation and reduction in the useful life of the Rights-of-Way that will
result from Construction that has taken place therein. "Degradation and the
reduction in the useful life" for the purpose of this Section means the
accelerated depreciation of the Rights-of-Way caused by Construction in or
disturbance of the Rights-of-Way, resulting in the need to reconstruct or
repair such Rights-of-Way earlier than would be required if the Construction
did not occur.
      (3)    Except as otherwise provided herein, no future Construction
Permits shall be issued to an Applicant without payment of all outstanding
Construction Permit Fee invoices. The City shall be exempt from payment of
Construction Permit Fees. Construction Permit Fees that were paid for a Permit
that the City has revoked in accordance with this chapter are not refundable.
   
   (e)    Joint Applications. Applicants are encouraged to submit joint
Applications for
Construction Permits to work in the Rights-of-Way at the same place and time.
Joint Applicants shall have the ability to divide amongst themselves, in
proportions the parties find appropriate, any applicable Construction Permit
Fees.
   (f)    Exceptions to Permit Requirements. The following shall be excluded
from the
requirements of Section
 961.16:
      (1)    The repairing or improvement of streets or other public places
under or by virtue of a contract with the City.
      (2)    The maintenance, planting or removal of trees and shrubs from
within the Right-of-Way. (Ord. 53-2018. Passed 6-28-18; Ord. 86-2021. Passed 9-
23-21.)
961.15  CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION AND RESTORATION.
   (a)    Utility Engineering Study Required.
      (1)    Prior to commencement of any initial Construction, extension, or
relocation of Facilities in the Rights-of-Way, except for repair, maintenance
or replacement with like Facilities or relocations requested or caused by a
third party (excluding the City) or another Permittee, a Permittee shall
conduct a utility engineering study on the proposed route of Construction
expansion or relocation if requested by the Director of Public Service. Where
such Construction and/or relocation is requested or caused by a third party,
every Permittee located within the Rights-of-Way at issue or involved with the
work shall use all Best Efforts to cooperate and assist any other Permittee or
person who is directed by the City to perform the required utility engineering
study. A utility engineering study consists of, but is not limited to,
completion of the following tasks:
         A.    Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats and other location
data indicating the existence and approximate location of all Facilities along
the proposed Construction route.
         B.    Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
Facilities along the proposed Construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts and visible street cut repairs.
         C.    Determine and record the presence and precise location of all
underground facilities the Applicant or Person on whose behalf the Permit was
applied for owns or controls in the Rights-of-Way along the proposed System
route. Upon request of the Director of Public Service, a Permittee shall also
record and identify the general location of all other Facilities in the Rights-
of-Way along the proposed System route. For the purposes of this Section,
general location shall mean the alignment of other Facilities in the Rights-of-
Way, but shall not necessarily mean the depth of other Facilities in the
Rights-of-Way.
         D.    Plot and incorporate the data obtained from completion of the
tasks described in subsection (a)(1) A. to C. on the Construction Permittee's
proposed System route maps, Construction plans, plan sheets or computer aided
drafting and design (CADD) files, or other data files in a format compatible
with that used by the City.
         E.    Where the proposed location of Facilities and the location of
existing underground facilities appear to conflict on the plans drafted in
accordance with subsection (a)(1)(4), Permittee has the option of either
utilizing non- destructive digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the
critical points identified to determine as precisely as possible, the
horizontal, vertical and spatial position, composition, size and other
specifications of the conflicting underground facilities, or redesigning the
Construction plans to eliminate the apparent conflict. A Permittee shall not
excavate more than a three (3) feet by three (3) feet square hole in the
Rights-of-Way to complete this task.
         F.    Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this section, adjust the proposed System design to avoid the need
to relocate other Underground Facilities.
      (2)    The Director of Public Service may modify the scope of the utility
engineering study as necessary depending on the proposed Construction plans.
   (b)    Copy to City. Upon completion of the tasks described in subsection
(a) hereof, the Construction Permittee shall submit the proposed System route
maps and Construction Plans, with the results of the utility engineering study,
in the most advanced format (including, but not be limited to electronic and/or
digital format) then currently being used by the Provider that is then
currently capable of technologically being read (or readily converted to a
readable form) by the City. The mapping data is required to be at the "Atlas"
level of detail necessary for the City to reasonably determine the location of
the Provider's facilities in the Rights-of-Way. The Provider shall supply the
mapping data on paper if the Director of Public Service determines that the
format currently being used by the Provider is not capable
of being read by the City.
   (c)    Qualified Firm. All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to
this section shall be performed by the Permittee if in the discretion of the
Director of Public Service the Construction Permittee is qualified to complete
the project itself; alternatively, utility engineering studies shall be
performed by a firm specializing in utility engineering that is approved by the
City.
   (d)    Cost of Study. The Permittee shall bear the cost of compliance with
subsection (a) to (c) hereof.
   (e)    Construction Schedule. Unless otherwise provided for in this chapter
or in the Rules and Regulations, or unless the Director of Public Service
waives any of the requirements of this Section due to unique or unusual
circumstances, a Permittee shall be required to submit a written Construction
schedule to the City fourteen (14) business days before commencing any work in
or about the Rights-of-Way, and shall further notify the City not less than two
(2) business days in advance of any excavation in the Rights-of-Way. This
Section shall apply to all situations with the exception of circumstances under
Section 961.16(d) (Emergency Situations).
   (f)    Location of Facilities.
      (1)    The placement of new Facilities and replacement of old Facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable laws and the City's Rules and Regulations.
      (2)    The City shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement
of new or additional Facilities within the Rights-of-Way if the Right-of-Way is
Full. In making such decisions, the City shall strive to the extent possible to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the Rights-of-Way, but shall be
guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety and welfare,
the condition of the Rights-of-Way, the time of year with respect to essential
Utilities, the protection of existing Facilities in the Rights-of-Way, future
City and County plans for public improvements, development projects which have
been determined to be in the public interest and nondiscriminatory and
competitively neutral treatment among Providers.
   (g)    Least Disruptive Technology. All Construction or maintenance of
Facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of
damage and disruption of the Rights-of-Way. Specifically, every Permittee when
performing underground Construction, if technically and/or technologically
feasible and not economically unreasonable, shall utilize Trench less
Technology, including, but not limited to, horizontal drilling, directional
boring, and microtunneling. In addition, all cable, wire or fiber optic cable
installed in the subsurface Rights-of-Way pursuant to this chapter may be
required to be installed in conduit, and if so required, no cable, wire or
fiber optic cable may be installed pursuant to this chapter using "direct bury"
techniques.
   (h)    Special Exceptions.
      (1)    The City may grant a special exception to the requirements of
subsections (f) and (g) hereof if a Permittee, upon application, demonstrates
with written evidence that:
         A.    The exception will not create any threat to the City's
investment or in the Rights-of-Way, the public health, safety or welfare.
         B.    Permittee demonstrates that the increased economic burden and
the potential adverse impact on the Permittee's Construction schedule resulting
from the strict enforcement of the requirement actually or effectively inhibits
the ability of the Permittee to provide Services in the City.
         C.    The Permittee demonstrates that the requirement unreasonably
discriminates against the Permittee in favor of another Person.
         D.    The requirements requested by the City herein create an
unreasonable economic burden for the Permittee that outweighs any potential
benefit to the City.
   (i)    Relocation of Facilities.
      (1)    A Provider shall as promptly as reasonably possible and at its own
expense, permanently remove and relocate its Facilities in the Rights-of-Way
whenever the City finds it necessary to request such removal and relocation. In
instances where the City requests removal and/or relocation, the City shall
waive all applicable Construction Permit Fees. Upon removal and/or relocation,
the Provider shall restore the Rights-of-Way to the same or better condition it
was in prior to said removal or relocation. If existing poles are required to
be removed and/or relocated, then the existing poles will be replaced with
poles of the same or substantially similar size, or smaller. In accordance with
law, the Director of Public Service may request relocation and/or removal in
order to prevent unreasonable interference by the Provider's Facilities with:
         A.    A public improvement undertaken or approved by the City.
         B.    The City's investment in the Right-of-Way.
         C.    When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the Rights-of-Way.
         D.    The sale, conveyance, vacation, or narrowing of all or any part
of a Right-of-Way.
      (2)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Provider who has Facilities in
the Rights-of-Way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for
the purposes of the City, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated
portion or excess portion in conformity with O.R.C. 723.041.
      (3)    If, in the reasonable judgment of the City, a Provider fails to
commence removal and/or relocation of its Facilities, as designated by the
City, within thirty (30) days after the City's removal order, or if a Provider
fails to substantially complete such removal, including all associated repair
of the Rights-of-Way of the City, within twelve (12) months thereafter, then,
to the extent consistent with applicable law, the City shall have the right to:
         A.    Declare that all rights, title and interest to the Facilities
belong to the City with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited to,
the right to connect and use the Facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the Facilities to another Person for operation; or
         B.    Authorize removal of the Facilities installed by the Provider
in, on, over or under the Rights-of-Way of the City at Provider's cost and
expense, by another Person; however, the City shall have no liability for any
damage caused by such action and the Provider shall be liable to the City for
all reasonable costs incurred by the City in such action; and
         C.    To the extent consistent with applicable Law, any portion of the
Provider's Facilities in, on, over or under the Rights-of-Way of the City
designated by the City for removal and not timely removed by the Provider shall
belong to and become the property of the City without payment to the Provider,
and the Provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the City shall
request, in form and substance acceptable to the City, to evidence such
ownership by the City.
   (j)   Pre-Excavation Facilities Location.
      (1)    Before the start date of any Rights-of-Way excavation, each
Provider who has Facilities located in the area to be excavated shall, to the
best of its ability, be responsible to mark the horizontal and approximate
vertical placement of all its Facilities.
      (2)    All Providers shall notify and work closely with the excavation
contractor in an effort to establish the exact location of its Facilities and
the best procedure for excavation.
   (k)    Rights-of-Way Restoration.
      (1)    The work to be done under the Permit, and the Restoration of the
Rights-of-Way as required herein, weather permitting, must be completed within
the dates specified in the Permit. In addition to its own work, the Permittee
must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including
trench backfill, paving and its foundations in accordance with the Code and
City Rules and Regulations. If a Permittee is unable to timely complete the
Restoration of Rights-of- Way due to unreasonable inclement weather conditions,
the Permittee shall complete the Restoration of the Rights-of-Way as soon as
weather conditions make it possible to do so and upon said completion notify
the City.
      (2)    In approving an Application for a Construction Permit, the City
may have the Permittee restore the Rights-of-Way or the City may restore the
Rights-of-Way itself at the Permittee's cost if the Permittee has in the past
not abided by requirements of this chapter.
      (3)    If the City chooses to allow Permittee to restore the Rights-of-
Way, the Permittee shall, at the time of Application for a Construction Permit,
post a Construction Bond in an amount determined by the City to be sufficient
to cover the cost of restoring the Rights-of-Way to its approximate pre-
excavation condition. If, twelve (12) months after completion of the
Restoration of the Rights-of-Way, the City determines that the Rights-of-Way
have been properly restored, the surety on the Construction Bond shall be
released.
      (4)    The Permittee shall perform the work according to the standards
and with the materials specified by the City. The City shall have the authority
to prescribe the manner and extent of the Restoration, and may do so in written
procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The City in
exercising this authority shall be guided by the following standards and
considerations: the number, size, depth and duration of the excavations,
disruptions or damage to the Rights-of-Way; the traffic volume carried by the
Rights-of-Way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the Rights-of-Way;
the pre- excavation condition of the Rights-of-Way; the remaining life-
expectancy of the Rights-of-Way affected by the excavation; whether the
relative cost of the method of Restoration to the Permittee is in reasonable
balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the Rights-of-Way
that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the
Rights-of-Way; and the likelihood that the particular method of Restoration
would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the Rights-of-Way that would
otherwise take place. Methods of Restoration may include, but are not limited
to, patching the affected area, replacement of the Rights-of-Way base at the
affected area, and in the most severe cases, milling, overlay and/or street
reconstruction of the entire area of the Rights-of-Way affected by the work.
      (5)    By restoring the Rights-of-Way itself, the Permittee guarantees
its work and shall maintain it for twelve (12) months following its completion.
During this twelve (12) month period, it shall, upon notification from the
Department of Public Service, correct all Restoration work to the extent
necessary using the method required by the Department of Public Service.
Weather permitting, said work shall be completed within five (5) calendar days
of the receipt of the notice from the Department of Public Service, unless
otherwise extended by the Department of Public Service.
      (6)    If the Permittee fails to restore the Rights-of-Way in the manner
and to the condition required by the City, or fails to satisfactorily and
timely complete all repairs required by the City, the City, at its option, may
do such work. In that event, the Permittee shall pay to the City, within thirty
(30) days of invoicing, the Restoration cost of restoring the Rights-of-Way and
any other costs incurred by the City. Upon failure to pay, the City may call
upon any bond or letter of credit posted by Permittee and/or pursue any and all
legal and equitable remedies.
      (7)    If the work to be done under the Permit is being done at the same
location and the same period oftime as work by the City and/or another Permitee
(s), then the Director of Public Service may reasonably apportion the
Restoration responsibility among the City, Providers and/or other Persons.
   (I)    Damage to Other Facilities.
      (1)    In the case of an Emergency, and if possible after reasonable
efforts to contact the Provider seeking a timely response, when the City
performs work in the Rights-of-Way and finds it necessary to maintain, support,
or move a Provider's Facilities to protect those Facilities, the costs
associated therewith will be billed to that Provider and shall be paid within
thirty (30) days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the City may
pursue all legal and equitable remedies or the City may call upon any bond or
letter of credit posted by the Permittee and pursue any and all legal or
equitable remedies. Each Provider shall be responsible for the cost of
repairing any damage caused by its Facilities to the Facilities of another
Provider during the City's response to an Emergency.
      (2)    Each Provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
City-owned Facilities in the Rights-of-Way that the Provider or its Facilities
damage.
   (m)    Rights-of-Way Vacation. If the City sells or otherwise transfers a
Right-of-Way that contains the Facilities of a Provider, such sale or transfer
shall be subject to any existing easements of record and any easements required
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 723.041.
   (n)    Installation Requirements. The excavation, backfilling, Restoration,
and all other work performed in the Rights-of-Way shall be performed in
conformance with all applicable laws, City Rules and Regulations, other
standards as may be promulgated by the Director of Public Service.
   (o)    Inspection. When the Construction under any Permit hereunder is
completed, the Permittee shall notify the Department of Public Service.
      (1)    The Permittee shall make the Construction site available to the
Inspector and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the Construction.
      (2)    At the time of inspection, the Inspector may order the immediate
cessation of any work that poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public, violates any law or that violates the term and
conditions of the Permit and/or this chapter. The City may inspect the work;
however, the failure of the City to inspect the work does not alleviate the
responsibility of the Permittee to complete the work in accordance with the
approved Permit and the requirements of this chapter.
      (3)    The Inspector may issue an order to the Permittee for any work
that does not conform to the Permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or
codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be
cause for revocation of the Permit. The order may be served on the Permittee as
provided in Section
 961.19(d). An order may be appealed to the Director of Public Service. The
decision of the Director of Public Service may be appealed to the Mayor whose
decision shall be final. If not appealed, within ten (10) days after issuance
of the order, the Provider shall present proof to the Director of Public
Service that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been
presented within the required time, the Director of Public Service may revoke
the Permit.
   (p)    Other Obligations.
      (1)    Obtaining a Construction Permit does not relieve Permittee of its
duty to obtain all other necessary Permits, licenses, and authority and to pay
all fees required by any other City, county, state or federal laws.
      (2)    Permittee shall comply with all requirements of all laws,
including the Ohio Utility Protection Service.
      (3)    Permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all
applicable laws and standards, and is responsible for all work done in the
Rights-of- Way pursuant to its Permit, regardless of who performs the work.
      (4)    No Rights-of-Way obstruction or excavation may be performed when
seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except
in the case of an Emergency as outlined in Section
961.16(d).
      (5)    Permittee shall not obstruct a Right-of-Way so as to interfere
with the natural free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other
waterways. The Director of Public Service may waive this requirement if it is
technically or economically unreasonable in the circumstances.
   (q)    Undergrounding Required. Any owner of property abutting a street or
alley where Service Facilities are now located underground and where the
Service connection is at the property line, shall install or cause others to
install underground any Service delivery infrastructure from the property line
to the buildings or other structures on such property to which such Service is
supplied. Where not otherwise required to be placed underground by this
chapter, a Provider shall locate Facilities underground at the request of an
adjacent property owner, provided that such placement of Facilities underground
is consistent with the Provider's normal construction and operating standards
and that the additional costs of such undergrounding over the normal aerial or
above ground placement costs of identical Facilities are borne directly by the
property owner making the request. A Provider, under any circumstance shall,
upon the reasonable request of the City, always use Best Efforts to place
Facilities underground. Where technically possible and not economically
unreasonable or unsafe (based upon the technology employed and Facilities
installed), all Facilities to be installed by a Provider under the Right-of-Way
shall be installed
in conduit. (Ord. 53-2018. Passed 6-28-18; Ord. 86-2021. Passed 9-23-21.)
961.16 ENFORCEMENT OF PERMIT OBLIGATION.
   (a)    Mandatory Denial of Permit. Except in the case of an Emergency, no
Permit will be granted:
      (1)    To any Person who has not yet made an Application or who is
occupying any Right-of-Way without a valid Certificate of Registration; or
      (2)    To any Person who has outstanding debt owed to the City unless
payment in full has been placed in an escrow account approved by the City
Director of Finance and the Law Director; or
      (3)    To any Person as to whom there exists grounds for the revocation
of a Permit in accordance with the provisions contained herein; or
      (4)    If, in the discretion of the Director of Public Service, the
issuance of a Permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict
or interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The
Director of Public Service, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by
the safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the Rights-of-
Way, and by considerations relating to the public health, safety and welfare
and/or the City's investment in the Right-of-Way.
   (b)    Permissive Denial of Permit. The Director of Public Service may deny
a Permit in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, and/or
protect the City's investment in the Right-of-Way to prevent interference with
the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the Rights-of-Way, or when
necessary to protect the Rights-of-Way and its users.
      (1)    The Director of Public Service, in his/her discretion, may
consider one or more of the following factors:
         A.    The extent to which Rights-of-Way space where the Permit is
sought is available; and/or
         B.    The competing demands for the particular space in the Rights-of-
Way; and/or
         C.    The availability of other locations in the Rights-of-Way or in
other Rights-of-Way for the proposed Facilities; and/or
         D.    The applicability of this chapter or other regulations of the
Rights-of-Way that affect location of Facilities in the Rights-of-Way; and/or
         E.    The degree of compliance of the Provider with the terms and
conditions of its Certificate of Registration, this chapter, and other
applicable ordinances and regulations; and/or
         F.    The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and
businesses that will result from the use of that part of the Rights-of-Way;
and/or
         G.    The condition and age of the Rights-of-Way, and whether and when
it is scheduled for total or partial re-construction; and/or
         H.    The balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and
damage to the Rights-of-Way, against the benefits to that part of the public
served by the expansion into additional parts of the Rights-of-Way; and/or
         I.    Whether such Applicant or its agent has failed within the past
three (3) years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance with, the
requirements of this chapter, or, if applicable, any other law.
      (2)    Under no circumstances will open cutting take place on any street
except where:
         A.    An Emergency situation constitutes that an open cut is
necessary; and/or
         B.    Vital services to resident(s) or business(es) are needed or have
been cut off and there is no reasonable alternative (such as jacking or boring)
in supplying or restoring such services; and/or
         C.    The Director of Public Service determines it is in the best
interests of the City that such an open cut take place.
   (c)    Discretionary Issuance of Permit.
      (1)    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(l) and (a)(2),
the Director of Public Service may issue a Permit in any case in which the
Permit is necessary;
         A.    To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the
Permit Applicant, if established by credible evidence satisfactory to the City;
or
         B.    To allow such customer to improve its Service; or
         C.    To allow a new economic development project to be granted a
Permit under this section.
      (2)    To be granted a Permit under this section, the Permit Applicant
must not have had knowledge of the hardship, the plans for improvement of
Service, or the development project when it was required to submit its list of
next year projects.
   (d)    Work Done Without A Permit in Emergency Situations.
      (1)    Each Provider shall, as soon as is practicable, immediately notify
the Director of Public Service of any event regarding its Facilities which it
considers to be an Emergency. The Provider may proceed to take whatever actions
are necessary in order to respond to the Emergency. Within five (5) business
days, unless otherwise extended by the Director of Public Service, after the
occurrence or discovery of the Emergency (whichever is later), the Provider
shall apply for the necessary Permits, pay the fees associated therewith or
have those fees attributed to its quarterly invoice balance in accordance with
section Q(4) and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself
into compliance with this chapter for any and all actions taken in response to
the Emergency. In the event that the City becomes aware of an Emergency
regarding a Provider's Facilities, the City may use Best Efforts to contact the
Provider or the System Representative of each Provider affected, or potentially
affected, by the Emergency. In any event, the City may take whatever action it
deems necessary in order to respond to the Emergency, the cost of which shall
be borne by the Provider whose Facilities caused the Emergency.
      (2)    Except in the case of an Emergency, any Provider who Constructs
in, on, above, within, over, below or through a Rights-of-Way without a valid
Permit must subsequently obtain a Permit, pay double the calculated fee for
said Permit, pay double all the other fees required by the Code, deposit with
the City the fees necessary to correct any damage to the Rights-of-Way and
comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
   (e)    Revocation of Permits.
      (1)    Permittees hold Permits issued pursuant to this chapter as a
privilege and not as a right. The City reserves its right, as provided herein,
to revoke any Permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a failure of
the Permittee to comply with the terms and conditions of any law, ordinance,
rule or regulation, or Design Guidelines where applicable, or any provision or
condition of the Permit, including, but not limited to the following:
         A.    The violation of any provision or condition of the Permit; or
         B.    An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the

including damages to the Rights-of-Way, whether caused by a violation of any of
the provisions of this chapter or other provisions of the City Code of
Ordinances.
   (b)    Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase,
or portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional
by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion
shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such
holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. If a
regulatory body or a court of competent jurisdiction should determine by a
final, non-appealable order that any Permit, right or any portions of this
section are illegal or unenforceable, then any such Permit or right granted or
deemed to exist hereunder shall be considered as a revocable Permit with a
mutual right in either party to terminate without cause upon giving sixty (60)
days written notice to the other. The requirements and conditions of such a
revocable Permit shall be the same requirements and conditions as set forth in
the Permit, right or registration, respectively, except for conditions relating

         (d)   SEDIMENT CONTROL PRACTICES: The applicant must install
structural practices that shall store runoff, allowing sediments to settle and/
or divert flows away from exposed soils or otherwise limit runoff from exposed
areas. Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap sediment
from a site remaining disturbed for more than fourteen days. Such practices may
include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet
protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to a
sediment settling pond. All sediment control practices must be capable of
ponding runoff in order to be considered functional. Earth diversion dikes or
channels alone are not considered a sediment control practice unless used in
conjunction with a sediment settling pond.
         (e)   NON-SEDIMENT POLLUTANT CONTROLS: No solid or liquid waste,
including building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The
applicant must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic
materials, hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources
or wetlands.
         (f)   COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS: The SWP3 shall be consistent
with applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic
system regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open
burning, and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils
located within the development area.
         (g)   TRENCH AND GROUND WATER CONTROL: There shall be no sediment-
laden or turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from
dewatering activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must
pass through a sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment
control device, prior to being discharged from the construction site.
Alternatively, sediment may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering
into a sump pit, filter bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering
which does not contain sediment or other pollutants is not required to be
treated prior to discharge. However, care must be taken when discharging ground
water to ensure that it does not become pollutant- laden by traversing over
disturbed soils or other pollutant sources.
         (h)   INTERNAL INSPECTIONS: All controls on the site shall be
inspected by the applicant's agent at least once every seven calendar days and
within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24
hour period. The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to
conduct these inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional
and to evaluate whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control
measures are required. Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with
knowledge and experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and
erosion controls.
         (i)   MAINTENANCE: The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization. The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by the SWCD. When inspections reveal the need
for repair, replacement, or installation of erosion and sediment control BMPs,
the following procedures shall be followed:
            (1)   When practices require repair or maintenance. If an
inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance,
with the exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or
maintained within three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds
must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
            (2)   When practices fail to provide their intended function. If an
inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its intended
function as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control
practice is required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice
must be installed within ten (10) days of the inspection.
            (3)   When practices depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an
inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection
reveals that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must
contain a statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not
needed.
         (j)   FINAL STABILIZATION: Final stabilization is reached when 75% of
the disturbed area has been protected from erosion by vegetation, clean stone,
pavement, or other acceptable means.
      2.   POST CONSTRUCTION WATER QUALITY PRACTICES.
         (a)   NON-STRUCTURAL WATER QUALITY PRACTICES: Non-structural post
construction best management practices include preservation, planning, or
procedures that direct development away from water resources or limit creation
of impervious surfaces. Practices such as conservation easements, riparian and
wetland setbacks, and conservation subdivision design are all non-structural
controls.
            (1)   All non-structural water quality practices must be protected
from disturbance through the construction phase of the project.
            (2)   All non-structural water quality practices must be protected
in perpetuity through the use of appropriate legal tools. All easement or
conservation areas must appear on the final plat and be disclosed to potential
buyers.
         (b)   STRUCTURAL WATER QUALITY PRACTICES: Structural post construction
best management practices are permanent features constructed to provide
treatment of storm water runoff either through storage, filtration, or
infiltration.
            (1)   All structural water quality practices must be established
prior to the completion of the project. Structural water quality practices
should be made functional once the disturbed areas on site are stabilized. If
detention/retention facilities were used for sediment control during
development, sediments must be removed prior to the basin being used for post
construction storm water quality.
            (2)   MAINTENANCE. The post construction water quality practice
must be maintained in perpetuity by those parties identified in the SWPPP, the
applicable recorded plat, or other maintenance requirements of the City.

1301.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code as adopted herein is:
   (a)    To provide uniform minimum standards and requirements for the
erection, construction, repair, alteration and maintenance of buildings,
including construction of industrialized units. Such standards shall relate to
the conservation of energy, safety and sanitation of buildings for their
intended use and occupancy.
   (b)   Formulate such standards and requirements, so far as is practicable,
in terms of performance objectives, so as to make adequate performance for the
use intended the test of acceptability.
   (c)    Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of materials and
technical methods, devices and improvements, including the use of
industrialized units which tend to reduce the cost of construction and erection
without affecting minimum requirements for the health, safety and security of
the occupants or users of buildings or industrialized units and without
preferential treatment of types or classes, of materials or products or methods
of construction.
   (d)   Encourage, so far as may be practicable, the standardization of
construction practices, methods, equipment, material and techniques, including
methods employed to produce industrialized units.

maintenance or other similar conditions which otherwise constitute a public

the general public requires the establishment of these property maintenance
standards.

comply with the provisions of this Property Maintenance Code, irrespective of
when such building has been constructed, altered or repaired, or premises
occupied, except as hereinafter provided.

other regulation, the provision which establishes the higher standard for the
promotion and protection of the safety and health of the people shall prevail.
   (d)   Existing Remedies. Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to abolish,
impair, or prevent the execution of any existing remedies of the City of
Tallmadge or its officers or agents related to the abatement of a public
nuisance.  The provisions in this Code shall not be construed to abolish or
impair existing remedies of the jurisdiction or its officers or agencies
relating to the removal or demolition of any structure which is dangerous or
unsafe.
   (e)   Separability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause,
or phrase of this Code is declared invalid for any reason, such declaration
shall not affect the remaining portions of this Code, which shall continue in
full force and effect, and to this end, the provisions of this Property
Maintenance Code are deemed severable.
   (f)   Savings Clause. This Code shall not affect violations of any other
resolution, ordinance, code or regulation existing prior to the effective date
of this Property Maintenance Code, and any violations of such shall be governed
and shall continue to be punishable to the full extent of the law under the
provisions of those ordinances, codes or regulations in effect at the time the
