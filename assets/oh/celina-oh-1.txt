hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the City of Celina, Ohio.
SECTION TWO
   That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions of the
Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect from and immediately
after passage of this Ordinance and its approval by the Mayor. All ordinances

inconsistent with any provision of the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed
as of the effective date of this Ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in the
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision, shall

and modification.

legally accurate and sufficient.

necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, safety, convenience

that there exists an imperative necessity for the earliest publication and
distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of the

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the

provision prevail.

irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.

meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an

commissions or other compensation of a nonresident employee, and paid by him or
them to the Tax Administrator, shall be accepted as the return required of any
nonresident employee whose sole income, subject to tax under this Chapter, is
such qualifying wages, salaries, bonus payments, commissions, or other
compensation. No taxpayer shall be required to file a return if they have not
attained the age of 16 years at the end of the year. The Tax Administrator is
hereby authorized to provide, by regulation, relief from the annual filing
requirement to certain retired individuals who no longer are expected to have
income taxable to the City of Celina. Provisions of this Section are effective
with tax years beginning on or after 1/1/1996.
                                                               
   (b)   The return shall be filed with the Tax Administrator on a form or
forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Tax Administrator

contains all of the information required to be submitted with the City's
prescribed returns, reports, or documents, and if the taxpayer or return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the rules or
ordinances of this City governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Extension Requests:
   (c)   Effective 1/1/2001, any taxpayer that has requested an extension for
filing a federal income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a
City tax return. The taxpayer shall make the request by filing a copy of the
taxpayer's request for a federal filing extension with the Tax Administrator.
   The request for the extension shall be filed not later than the last day for
filing the tax return as prescribed by this Chapter.
   Any taxpayer not required to file a federal tax return may request an
extension for filing a City income tax return, in writing, by the due date for
filing return.
   A valid extension request extends the filing date to fifteen (15) days
beyond the granted federal extension period.
   The Tax Administrator may deny a taxpayer's request for an extension if the
taxpayer:
      (1)   Fails to timely file the request; or
      (2)   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request; or
       (3)   Owes the City any delinquent income tax or any penalty, interest
assessment or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax; or
      (4)   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or other
related document of a prior tax period.
   The granting of an extension for filing a City income tax return does not
extend the last date for paying the tax without penalty unless the City grants
an extension of that date.
   The estimated tax payments must still be made by the due dates per the
provisions of this Chapter.
   (d)   (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon;
provided, however; that where any portion of the tax so due shall have been
deducted at the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.06, or where any portion of said tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer
pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.07, or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality, credit
for the amount so paid in accordance with Section
181.15 hereof, shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the
balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing said return.
      (2)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the City is
entitled under the provisions of this Chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his election indicated on the
return, such overpayment (or part hereof) shall be refunded, provided, however,
that no additional taxes or overpayments of less than one and 1/100 dollars
($1.01) shall be collected, carried forward, or refunded (Effective with tax
years beginning on or after 1/1/2002).
Amended Returns:

Tax Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three (3) months from the final determination of any federal
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City tax
based upon such final determination of federal tax liability and pay any
additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (f)   The Tax Administrator shall designate, by regulation, the filing level
that pass- through entities shall be required to file and pay tax due.
(Ord. 2-05-O. Passed 2-14-05.)
   181.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   In accordance with the Rules and Regulations prescribed by the Tax
Administrator, each employer within or doing business within the City shall
deduct at the time of the payment of such Qualifying wages, salaries, bonus
payments, commissions or other compensation the tax of one percent (1%) of the
qualifying wages, salaries, bonus payments, commissions or other compensation
due from the said employer to said employee, on or before the last day of the
month following the month of deduction of said tax, make a return and pay to
the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes so deducted. Each employer, on or
before the last day of the month following the month in which tax was deducted,
shall make a return and pay to the Administrator, the amount of taxes so
deducted [except if during the previous calendar year said annual withholding
amount is less than twelve thousand dollars ($12,000.00), then payment may be
remitted on the last day of the month following the close of each quarter].
Once an employer has met the monthly remitting requirements, said employer
shall continue to remain a monthly payer. Said returns shall be on a form or
forms prescribed by or acceptable to the Tax Administrator and shall be subject
to the Rules and Regulations prescribed thereafter by the Tax Administrator.
   Such employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax to be withheld,
whether or not such taxes have in fact been withheld.
 
   (b)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by the City or by the
employer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer to remit to the City the tax withheld
relieves the employee from liability for that tax, unless the employee colluded
with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (c)   Such employer in collecting said tax shall be deemed to hold the same,
until payment is made by such employer to the City, as a Trustee for the
benefit of the City and any such tax collected by such employer from his
employees shall, until the same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund in
the hands of such employer.
   In the event taxes withheld from the qualifying wages, salaries,
commissions, and other compensation of employees are not paid to the City in
accordance with the provisions on this Section, all officers, members,
managers, employees, and trustees having control or supervision of, or charged
with the responsibility of filing the return and making payment, are jointly
and severally personally liable for the tax not returned or paid to the City,
as well as any related interest and penalties, and are also liable under
provisions of Section
181.12 hereof. The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer’s,
member’s, manager’s, employee’s, or trustee’s liability for a failure of the
corporation, limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or
pay said taxes.
   (d)    Each employer shall file a withholding tax reconciliation showing the
sum total of all compensation paid all employees, the portion of which, (if
any) was not subject to withholding along with an explanation for same, and the
portion of which was subject to withholding, together with the amount of such
withholdings remitted. Such return shall include information concerning each
employee from whom the city tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip
code and social security number of each such employee, the total amount of
compensation paid during the year and the amount of City tax withheld. If the
total tax withheld from any employee included tax withheld and remitted to
another City, the amount of same shall be separately shown on the return of
information to the City concerning each employee. The withholding tax
reconciliation shall be filed by each employer on or before February 28
following each calendar year.
   (e)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this Section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-MISC
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed, shall
also report such payments to the City when services were performed in the City.
The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall include the name,
address, and social security number (or federal identification number), and the
amount of the payments made. Copies of Federal 1099-Misc Form(s) may be
submitted in lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed annually on
or before February 28 following each calendar year. The listing is required
even if 1099-misc form(s) were not issued.

Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by Governor Kasich
on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal corporations to conform to
and adopt the provisions of ORC 718 in order to have the authority to impose,
enforce, administer and collect a municipal income tax.
   (B)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 59-15-O,
effective January 1, 2016, comprehensively amends Chapter
182 in accordance with the provisions of ORC 718 to allow the Municipality to
continue the income tax and withholding tax administration and collection
efforts on behalf of the Municipality.
(Ord. 59-15. Passed 11-23-15.)

   182.03 DEFINITIONS.
   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this chapter:
   (1)   "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
under division 23(D) of this section, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (A)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (B)   Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (C)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
      (D)   (i)   Except as provided in division (1)(D)(ii) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (ii)   Division (1)(D)(i) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (E)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income;
      (F)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income;
      (G)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Ohio Revised Code;
      (H)   (i)   Except as limited by divisions (1)(H)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of
this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable
year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
      The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit
that is reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal
taxable income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating
loss carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following
the taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years
than necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
            (Ord. 59-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
         (ii)   No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (1)(H) of
this section to offset qualifying wages, and no person shall use the deduction
allowed by division (1)(H) of this section to allow net operating loss(es) to
offset lottery or gambling winnings and/or miscellaneous income. (Ord. 33-16.
Passed 9-12-16.)
         (iii)   (a)   For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021,
or 2022, a person may not deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a
municipal corporation that levies an income tax before January 1, 2016, more
than fifty per cent of the amount of the deduction otherwise allowed by
division (1)(H)(i) of this section.
            (b)    For taxable years beginning in 2023 or thereafter, a person
may deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a municipal corporation
that levies an income tax before January 1, 2016, the full amount allowed by
division (1)(H) of this section without regard to the limitation of division
(1)(H)(iii)(a).
         (iv)   Any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward deduction that is

payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to

agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting

behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
182.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section
182.051 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 59-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
   182.053 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; CASINO AND VLT.
   (A)    The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino
operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and
section 3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, respectively, or a lottery sales
agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.
   (B)    If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by section
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the casino operator shall deduct
and withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the
tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is
located.
   (C)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in trust
for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator shall
file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the Municipality,
providing the name, address, and social security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of
the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino
gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the
preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any
amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If
the name, address, or social security number of a person or the amount deducted
and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
      (3)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the amounts
deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or annual
return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or filed
late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at the
rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
section
182.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

   182.06 INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX.
   182.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   “Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
182.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
182.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
182.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   “Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section

      (4)   "Pre-2017 Net Operating Loss Carryforward" is defined in Section
182.03 (32) of this Chapter.
         (Ord. 59-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
   182.062 NET PROFIT; INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX; ALTERNATIVE
APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions
182.062(B)(1) and (I) of this section, net profit from a business or profession
conducted both within and without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be
considered as having a taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of
municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the average ratio of the
following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
182.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B) (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
182.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
182.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, and except as
provided in division (I) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals made
and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section 182.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section 182.03 of this
Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has apportioned a
portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt
from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to that
municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its
net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount other
than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the
amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (I)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
182.05 of this Ordinance, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (1)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (1)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of Section
182.062 apply to such apportionment except as otherwise provided in this
division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.
Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under
this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(A) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (1)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (A)(1) of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (A)(2) of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (A)(3) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (D) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring. that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (B)(1)(2)(3)(4) of this section. However, a tax
administrator shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a
manner that it would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a
municipal corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's
qualifying remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
 182.05 of this chapter.
         (Ord. 42-23. Passed 12-18-23.)

defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   “Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
182.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
182.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
182.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended

         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's

the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
182.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of

in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:

payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

amount is calculated with reference to the credit limitations of this City.

the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized

compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which

denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the

year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)    If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

limitation on refunds as provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section 182.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable
credit equal to the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality against
the income tax the Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate
is higher, the tax representing the net difference of the tax rates is also
subject to collection by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest
accruing during the period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.

      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the tax
administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and

Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed

shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under Section
182.094 (A), 182.094 (E) or
 182.091 (G)(2), the tax administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any
notice to the taxpayer with regard to the return on or before the date the
taxpayer files the return or on or before the extended due date to file the
return, whichever occurs first.
If a tax administrator violates division (G)(3) of this section, the municipal
corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to
respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
Division (G)(3) of this section does not apply to an extension received under
Section
182.094(A) if the tax administrator has actual knowledge that the taxpayer
failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive the extension
under Section
182.094(A) or failed to file for an extension under Section
182.094 (C).
      (4)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
 182.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
182.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
 182.092 of this Chapter prevails.
         (Ord. 42-23. Passed 12-18-23.)
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b).
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (Ord. 59-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
      (2)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made. On the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
         (Ord. 33-16. Passed 9-12-16.)
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
182.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in section
182.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
      The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 59-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
   182.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 59-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
   182.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 59-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
   182.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For
tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of
Municipality's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall
be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal

return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
182.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
182.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 59-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
   182.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
182.10 of this Chapter.

to obtain a refund of an overpayment of tax. At or before the commencement of
an audit, the Tax Administrator shall inform the taxpayer when the audit is
considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest arising from
the audit.

   182.12 ROUNDING.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped, rounding down to
the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a
document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document.
(Ord. 59-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
   182.13 AUTHORITY AND POWERS OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   182.131 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS OF THE TAX
ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Tax Administrator has the authority to perform all duties and functions

issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths; provided that the powers
referred to in this division of this section shall be exercised by the Tax
Administrator only in connection with the performance of the duties
respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under a municipal corporation
income tax ordinance or resolution adopted in accordance with this chapter;
   (B)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax
Administrator's findings, and, if the Tax Administrator finds that there has
been an overpayment, approve and issue a refund payable to the taxpayer, the
taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as provided in this chapter;
   (E)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to the

Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (H)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
   (I)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding

      (Ord. 59-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
   182.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 59-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
   182.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 59-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
   182.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to section
182.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
section
182.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
182.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
182.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
182.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 59-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
   182.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 59-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
   182.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 59-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
   182.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of section
182.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 59-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
   182.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 59-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
   182.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three (3) members.
The three (3) members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality.
         Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   The members of the Local Board of Tax Review may receive
reimbursement of expenses for service on the board at the discretion of
Celina's City Council.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 59-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
   182.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
182.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
182.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
182.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 59-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
   182.20 ADOPTION OF RULES.

the internet.

other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if

to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and

evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine

   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is

through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.

   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to

entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.

the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.

device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.

in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or
exceeds the amount specified in subsection (a)(1)J. hereof, if both of the
following apply:
         A.   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a
prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
         B.   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled
substance in accordance with the health professional’s directions.
   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall
withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years. The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. (ORC 4511.19)
            5.   In all cases, if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s
name, immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense for ninety days in

section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two violations of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or other equivalent offenses is guilty of a misdemeanor. The court

section, it instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both
a jail term and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with
continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to
the thirty-day mandatory jail term. Notwithstanding the jail terms set forth in
Section
303.99, the additional jail term shall not exceed one year, and the cumulative

felony of the third degree and shall be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
subsection (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver’s or occupational driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating

4511.191.
      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may
sentence the offender to five consecutive days in jail and not less than
eighteen consecutive days of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with

license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of
the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in division (B) of Ohio R.C. 4503.231.
      (5)   If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order of criminal
forfeiture under this section is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or
(3) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other
penalty established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the

previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio

Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,

(ORC 2901.11)
   501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is

   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)

   501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
   501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         
"The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.

   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
 
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.

cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and

difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.

   545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the property or
services involved for the purpose of determining the value is the aggregate
value of all property and services involved in all of the offenses in the
course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
   545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

(15) year period following construction.
      (2)    If repairs, replacement, removal, and/or relocation of an
underground utility are made prior to a proposed street improvement, a report
shall be submitted which details the extent of the repairs and or replacement
of utilities which demonstrates due diligence on the part of the utility to
reduce the need for re-entering the street following the improvements. A
reduction of up to seventy-five percent (75%) in the Street Opening Payment
Schedule may be applicable for those utilities that demonstrate due diligence
in repair, replacement, and/or relocation of their infrastructure prior to the
street improvement.

and exempt a corporation, contractor, or public utility in the case of an
opening required as a result of a natural disaster such as, but not limited to,
a flood, tornado, or earthquake. The Safety Service Director shall also have
the authority to waive street opening costs due to circumstances beyond the
control of the utility involved and such related costs shall be assessed to the
contractor or entity responsible for causing the necessity of repair.
      (4)    Permits must be obtained retroactively as a result of a break in a
utility line that may occur after normal business hours and necessitates
emergency repairs. Such permit must be obtained within five (5) business days
after repair is initiated. (Ord. 47-10-0. Passed 10-25-10.)
   901.04  APPEALS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall review any appeals made by individuals,
corporations,
contractors, or public utilities who are not satisfied with the decision made

exemption section of this Chapter. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear both
parties and make a decision based upon the information provided. The decision
of the Appeals Board shall be binding and final.
(Ord. 47-10-0. Passed 10-25-10.)
   901.05 FAILURE TO COMPLETE RESTORATION.
   Should public utilities or contractor(s) that occupy streets, alleys or
public grounds fail to complete their project within a reasonable time in the
City of Celina, then the City may make such necessary repairs and invoice said
public utility or contractor(s) for the cost of repairs and said public utility
or contractor(s) shall pay all costs (labor, equipment, and or materials) of
restoring said pavement or surface and shall make payment to City not later
than thirty (30) days from date of invoice. (Ord. 47-10-0. Passed 10-25-10.)

   (a)   The Safety Service Director shall from time to time make rules and
regulations governing the opening of public streets, avenues, alleys, and
public grounds, and the materials to be used for resurfacing or repairing of
all openings made by the applicant(s). Such work shall be performed under the
supervision of the Public Works Department and or the Engineering Department of
the City of Celina.
   (b)   The permit holder shall be responsible for the immediate backfilling
of said openings in accordance with City policies and procedures regarding
same.
(Ord. 47-10-0. Passed 10-25-10.)
   901.08 BARRICADES AND WARNING LIGHTS.
   Every person who shall dig, or cause to be dug, in or adjoining any street,
alley, avenue, or public ground any excavation whatsoever, and every person who
shall occupy or cause to be occupied any portion of any street with building
material, or any obstruction, shall provide sufficient warning lights and
barricades to adequately protect pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Such person
shall cause not less than two (2) warning lights to be securely and
conspicuously posted in or near such excavation, building material or
obstruction (one or more at each end of the space so excavated or occupied) and
if the space occupied by such obstruction shall exceed ten feet (10') in
extent, additional lights shall be posted as aforesaid for every additional ten
feet (10') of excavation or obstruction. Such lights shall be kept operating
during the hours of darkness or at anytime ordinary visibility is obscured. The
Safety Service Director, or his designee, may require additional lights for an
excavated area deemed unsafe. In the case of excavations, whether in an
adjoining street, avenue, alley, or public ground and in case of other open or
exposed places within the City, suitable warning barriers shall be erected to
protect against accidents.
(Ord. 47-10-0. Passed 10-25-10.)
   901.09 INSTALLATION OF UTILITY SERVICE LINES.
   Prior to the construction or reconstruction of any street, alley, avenue, or
public ground, the Safety Service Director, or his designee, shall cause
notices to be sent to all abutting property owners, requiring them to install
any necessary utility service lines. Notice shall also be sent to all public or
private utility corporations and City Departments to repair, replace, relocate,
or install all necessary mains, conduits, service lines and structures.
Property owners, private and public utility corporations and City Departments
shall be allowed necessary, reasonable, and legal times required for the
aforesaid installations before the new pavement is laid. Thereafter, during the
period of three (3) years from final completion of the new pavement, no permit
for making an opening in such pavement shall be issued by the City, except by
express authority in each case from the Safety Service Director, which
authority shall be exercised only for reasons of public necessity or of undue
private hardship, where the necessity for the opening arises from causes over
which the applicant has no control. Lack of foresight in not installing service
connections prior to the laying of new pavement shall not be considered an
adequate reason for abrogation of the three-year restriction without adherence
with the Street Opening Payment Schedule as delineated in Section
901.03(d).
(Ord. 47-10-0. Passed 10-25-10.)
   901.99 PENALTY.
   Any person, firm, or corporation violating any of the above provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a minor misdemeanor. Each day of
continued violation and each opening made in any street, avenue, alley, or
public ground without complying with the provisions of this chapter shall
constitute a separate offense.

administrative decision of a category determination submission under OAC 3745-
3-09 or 40 CFR 403.6, whichever is later.
   (g)   Reporting Requirements for Dischargers
      (1)   Initial Ninety-day compliance reports. Within ninety days following
the date for final compliance, by the Discharger, with applicable pretreatment
standards set forth in this Chapter, or ninety days following commencement of
the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new Discharger, any
Discharger subject to this Chapter shall submit to the Director a written
report indicating: (a) the nature and concentration of all limited, prohibited
or otherwise regulated pollutants, materials or substances in its discharge,
and (b) the average and maximum daily flow of the wastewater discharge
expressed in gallons. The report shall state whether the applicable
pretreatment standards, limitations, or other requirements are being met and,
if not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is
necessary to bring the Discharger into compliance with such requirements. This
report shall be signed by an authorized representative of the Discharger and
certified that the results therein are representative of the normal daily
operations of the Discharger.
      (2)   Periodic self-monitoring compliance reports.
         A.   Any Discharger subject to a pretreatment standard set forth in
this Chapter, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or in
the case of a new Discharger, after commencement of the discharge to the City,
shall submit to the Director during the months of June and December, unless
required more frequently by the Director, a report indicating the nature and
concentration, of prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent which are
limited by the pretreatment standards hereof. In addition, this report shall
include a record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows
during the reporting period in subsection (c)(1) hereof. Flows shall be
reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided however, where cost or
feasibility considerations justify, the Director may accept reports of average
and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The Director, for good
cause shown, considering such factors as local high or low flow rates,
holidays, budget cycles, or other extenuating factors, may authorize the
submission of such reports on months other than those specified above.
      (3)   Reports by Dischargers shall contain all results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration,
or production and mass where required by the City. The frequency of monitoring
by the Discharger shall be as prescribed in the applicable pretreatment
standard of this Chapter. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with 40
CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR, Part 136 does not include a
sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analysis shall be performed in accordance with any other sampling and
analytical procedures approved by the Administrator of the EPA.
   (h)   Operating Upsets.
      (1)   Any Discharger which experiences an upset in operations which
places the Discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance with the
requirements of this Chapter or an Industrial Discharger Permit issued by the
City or Ohio EPA shall immediately inform the City. Where such information is
given orally, a written follow-up report shall be filed by the Discharger with
the City within five business days. The report shall specify:
         A.   Description of the upset, the cause thereof and the upset’s
impact on a Discharger’s compliance status;
         B.   Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance and if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance
is reasonably expected to occur.
         C.   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such upset or other conditions of noncompliance.
      (2)   Notification of an upset may be considered by the Director as a
mitigating circumstance in any enforcement action brought by the City against a
Discharger for any noncompliance which occurred during the period of upset.
   (i)   Control Manhole
      (1)   Each categorical Discharger shall install and operate, at the
Discharger’s own expense, a control manhole to allow inspection, sampling, and
flow measurement of each sewer discharge from the Discharger to the POTW. Each
control manhole shall be situated on the Discharger’s premises, except where
such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the Discharger.
In which case the City may, in its sole discretion, allow the manhole to be
installed in the public street or sidewalk area providing that the manhole is
located so that landscaping or parked vehicles will not obstruct it.
      (2)   There should be ample room in or near such control manhole to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The control manhole,
sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition at the expense of the Discharger.
      (3)   Construction of the control manhole shall not begin until plans
have been submitted and approved by the Director. Approval of proposed
facilities by the Director does not, in any way, guarantee that these
facilities will function in the manner described by their owner, designer or
contractor; nor shall it relieve any person of the responsibility to enlarge or
otherwise modify such facilities to accomplish the intended purpose.
      (4)   Each control manhole shall be constructed and maintained in
accordance with the Celina Construction Standards and specifications.
Construction shall be completed within 120 days of receipt of permit by
Discharger.
   (j)   Inspection and Sampling. The City may inspect the control manhole of
any Discharger to determine compliance with the requirements of this Chapter.
The Discharger shall allow the City or its representatives, to enter upon the
premises of the Discharger at all reasonable time for the purposes of
inspection, investigations, sampling or examination of records. The City shall
have the right to set up on the Discharger’s property, including the control
manhole, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, investigations,
inspections, compliance monitoring or metering operations.
      (1)   Where discharge is metered, the City water rates in effect may be
used to compute the corresponding water billing.
      (2)   Sampling and analysis of industrial waste shall be taken at the
correct location, consistent with the requirements of this Chapter, prior to
discharge into the City sewerage system. Tests and analysis of waters and
wastes shall be determined in accordance with the approved methods specified in
40 CFR, Part 136, or if there is no applicable approved method, a method
approved by USEPA or Ohio EPA.
   (k)   If any waters or wastes are introduced or discharged, or are proposed
to be introduced or discharged to the POTW, that contain or will contain the
substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in Section
917.03(a) and (b) of this Chapter, or in the judgment of the Director, will or
may have, a deleterious effect on the City’s POTW or receiving waters, create a
hazard to life or limb, or constitute a public nuisance, the Director may (1)
reject the waters or wastes; (2) require pretreatment to an acceptable
condition for introduction or discharge to the POTW; (3) require control over
the quantities and rates of discharge; or (4) require payment by the Discharger
or proposed Discharger to cover the added costs of handling, treating, and
disposing of the waters or wastes.
   (l)   No provision of this Section
917.06 shall be construed as authorizing a violation of, or a variance from,
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or any other requirement stated in
this Chapter.
   (m)   Trade Secrets
      (1)   Information and data furnished to the City with respect to a
Discharger shall be available to the public or other governmental agency
without restriction, unless the Discharger specifically requests and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets under Ohio law.
      (2)   When requested by a Discharger and approved by the Director, the
information and data constituting trade secrets shall not be made available to
the public; provided, however, that such trade secret information and data
shall be available to the State or Federal Governments, and may be used in any
judicial poor enforcement proceedings involving the Discharger furnishing the
information and data. Wastewater constituents and characteristics shall not be
recognized as trade secrets.
      (3)   The Director shall make a decision whether to treat information and
data as a trade secret within 45 days of a request to do so. Failure to make a
request to treat information or data as a trade secret shall constitute a
waiver of any rights the Discharger may have to prevent disclosure of the
information and data to the public or State or Federal Government.
         (Ord. 19-02-0. Passed 6-3-02.)
   917.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Emergency Suspension of Service. The Director may on an emergency
basis, without first holding a Show Cause Hearing, suspend wastewater treatment
service to a Discharger when the Director reasonably determines that an actual
or anticipated discharge presents or threatens an imminent substantial danger
to the health or welfare of persons, the environment, or the City’s POTW. Upon
receipt of an Emergency Suspension of Service Order and Notice to Show Cause,
the Discharger shall cease all discharges immediately. In the event of failure
of the Discharger to comply with the Emergency Suspension of Service Order, the
City may take all steps necessary to protect human health and welfare, the
environment and the City’s POTW, including but not limited to, blocking the
Discharger’s pipe leading to the City’s POTW or any other lawful remedy
available to the City. The Director shall hold a Show Cause Hearing within 10
business days of the date specified in the Order issued by the Director for the
Discharger to cease discharging in the Order where the Discharger shall show
cause as to why the Order shall not continue. Upon conclusion of the Show Cause
Hearing, the Director shall withdraw the Order and reinstate the wastewater
treatment service if the Discharger has submitted substantial and probative
evidence that the noncomplying discharge or conditions have been eliminated or
continue such Order in effect until the Discharger has demonstrated the danger
has been eliminated to the satisfaction of the Director.
   (b)   Revocation of Treatment Services. The Director may, after notification
to the Discharger and a Show Cause Hearing, revoke and terminate wastewater
treatment services to any Discharger for failing to:
      (1)   Accurately disclose the wastewater constituents and characteristics
of its discharge;
      (2)   Report significant changes in wastewater constituents or
characteristics, including the volume of flow discharged whether such change is
an increase or decrease in flow;
      (3)   Allow reasonable access to the Discharger’s premises by
representatives of the City for the purpose of inspection, investigation, or
monitoring; or
      (4)   Comply with the requirements of this Chapter, an Industrial
Discharger Permit issued by Ohio EPA or the Director, or judicial order or
court decision requiring compliance with this Chapter or the Industrial
Discharger Permit issued by Ohio EPA or the Director.

the Director.
   (c)   Revocation of Industrial Discharger Permit The Director may (1)
revoke, after notification to the Discharger and a Show Cause Hearing, an
Industrial Waste Permit issued by the Director; or (2) terminate, or cause to
be terminated, wastewater treatment system service to any premise, if a
violation of any provision of this Chapter is found to exist, or if a discharge
or introduction of wastewater causes or threatens to cause a condition of
contamination, pollution, or nuisance as defined in this Chapter. Revocation of
an Industrial Waste Permit by Ohio EPA or the Director is sufficient grounds
for revocation of treatment service. The notification shall state the reasons
for the revocation of service or permit.
   (d)   Notification of Violation. Whenever the Director finds that any
Discharger has violated or is violating this Chapter, the Director shall serve,
or cause to be served, upon such Discharger, a written Notice of Violation
(NOV) with or without a penalty, either personally or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature of the violation.
Within fifteen (15) business days of the date of receipt of the NOV, the
Discharger shall submit a written explanation of the violation to the Director,
and a proposed Remedial Action Plan (RAP) to correct the violation and prevent
a future violation. The Director may request the Discharger to sample the
discharge and submit the laboratory test results to the Director upon receipt
by the Discharger of the laboratory test. A Discharger’s RAP will be deemed to
be acceptable if compliance is achieved and steps have been taken to prevent
the violation from occurring again. The parties may meet to discuss the NOV and
proposed RAP and if agreeable to the Director, establish a compliance schedule,
with or without penalties and other conditions, for implementation of the RAP,
if compliance has not been achieved at the time the RAP is submitted to the
Director. If a Discharger disagrees with the Director’s finding that a
violation has or continues to occur, the Discharger, in lieu of submitting an
explanation and RAP, may request in writing, within fifteen (15) business days
of receipt of the NOV, a Show Cause Hearing before the Director to present
substantial and probative evidence as to why the Director’s NOV is not valid.
The Director may schedule the Show Cause Hearing at a reasonable time and place
after said request has been submitted. Multiple NOVs, which have been contested
within the required time, may be consolidated by the Director for decision in
one Show Cause Hearing. Failure to submit an explanation and RAP within the
time specified may subject the Discharger to further enforcement.
   (e)   Show Cause Hearings.
      (1)   Emergency Suspension of Service Order. The Director shall hold a
Show Cause Hearing within 10 days after issuing an Emergency Suspension of
Service Order under Chapter
917.06(a) to allow the Discharger, or the Discharger’s authorized
representative, to submit reliable, probative and substantial evidence as to
why such Emergency Order should not continue. Upon the conclusion of the
hearing, the Director shall determine whether the Order shall continue or be
withdrawn. The Director may adopt procedures for holding such hearings.
      (2)   Revocation of Service or Permit. The Director shall hold a Show
Cause Hearing whenever the Director seeks to revoke service on a non-emergency
basis, or seeks to revoke a Discharger’s Industrial Discharger Permit issued by
the Director before such revocation of service or permit. Written Notice shall
be provided to the Discharger within 30 days of such Show Cause Hearing stating
the reasons for the revocation. The Discharger shall present reliable,
probative and substantial evidence as to why services or the permit should not
be revoked. Upon a reasonable time after such hearing is held, the Director
shall issue a decision as to whether the service or permit should be revoked,
and whether further enforcement should be pursued. The manner and scope of
enforcement is within the discretion of the Director. The Director may adopt
procedures for holding such hearings.
      (3)   Notices of Violations. A Discharger may request a Show Cause
Hearing to present reliable, probative and substantial evidence as to why a NOV
issued by the Director is not valid and should not be subject to enforcement.
The request shall be submitted to the Director within fifteen business days
   of receipt of the NOV. A hearing may be held at a reasonable time and place
to be determined by the Director. Multiple NOVs issued to the same Discharger
within a reasonable time may be consolidated for hearing. Upon a reasonable
time after such hearing is held, the Director shall issue a decision as to
whether the NOV is valid and should be the subject of enforcement. The manner
and scope of enforcement is within the Discretion of the Director. The Director
may adopt procedures for holding such hearings.
      (4)   Appeal of any decision, determination, or order of the Director may
be taken by the Discharger in accordance with applicable local or State law.

   931.01 PURPOSE; GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   The eventual users of sewer and water utilities shall pay the City for the
cost of extending the service within a reasonable proximity to the proposed
development. The City must insure that its sewer and water systems expansions
are planned to adequately provide services to logical and/or homogeneous areas
at the lowest area cost, considering both initial installation and subsequent
operating cost. The City shall not accept connection to its utility systems of
trunk or major lateral sewers or of water distribution mains which are of a
size or depth inadequate to handle the requirements of properties, however
owned, which constitute such a logical complex or area. In addition to the
required State approval of water and sewer design, developers shall be required
to have all utility plans approved by the City, through the office of the City
Engineer, prior to their installation.
(Res. 8-69-R. Passed 2-9-70.)
   931.02  FEASIBILITY STUDY.
   When a request is made for extension of water and/or sewer mains to a
development a feasibility study shall be made. This study shall consider the
technical factors and shall determine the area that will best and most
logically be served as an immediate and projected result of such utility
extension. The number of immediate users, the total number of users projected
over a feasible period, project costs including City engineering expenses,
revenue to the City in sewer and water charges and the money immediately
required by the City to pay the cost of the extension shall be determined. Upon
completion of the feasibility study or studies, a formula for assessing the
eventual users shall be developed. Through these assessments, the total dollar
costs to the City in making an extension to water and/or sewer utilities,
including the costs of interim financing, shall be returned to the City from
the users who will immediately or eventually benefit from the extension.
(Res. 8-69-R. Passed 2-9-70.)
   931.03 METHODS OF ALLOCATING EXPENSES.
   Because of the variety of circumstances under which a request for sewer or
water extension may be generated, no single method can be enunciated under
which an original or initial developer may be able to allocate or recover
expenses directly related to the City requirement for additional depth or pipe
size over than needed only for, and within, his individual development. In
general, four methods may be considered:
   (a)   The developer may obtain an agreement from the affected, adjoining
and/or nearby property owners for the sharing of this additional cost; or
   (b)   The developer may absorb these costs in his overall cost of
development in the interest of being able to proceed without the delays
inherent in subsection (a) hereof;
   (c)   Where a principal lateral is involved, the developer may approach the
City to require that such other property owners as would be affected and who
require a tap within a twenty year period be required to pay their fair share
of the differential cost of the sewer line at the time of such tap, and that
within such twenty year period this amount be returned to the developer who
installed the sewer; and
      (Res. 8-69-R. Passed 2-9-70.)
   (d)   Where a principal water or sewer trunk line is involved the City will
pay the developer the difference in cost of pipe and necessary material for the
increased size requirement requested by the City, provided that the developer
at his cost install such pipe and material at the proper depth necessary for a
proper connection to existing trunk lines.
      (Res. 7-70-R. Passed 11-9-70.)
   931.04 DEVELOPER'S DUTIES.
   (a)   Except as identified in Section
931.03, developers shall assume all costs of water and sewer installations
within their developments. All installations shall meet City and State
specifications.
   (b)   As any portion of an area is developed to be connected to the City
water and/or sewer utilities, the developer shall be required to annex to the
City unless granted an exemption by Council.
   (c)   This policy applies only to the extension of sewer and water utility
services and facilities and does not apply to replacement, maintenance or
rebuilding any established sewer and water mains.
   (d)   Conditions or situations not covered by this chapter should be brought
to the attention of the Safety-Service Director for a decision or referral to
Council.
(Res. 8-69-R. Passed 2-9-70.)
CHAPTER 933

      Purpose of zoning regulations - see P. & Z.
1141.01
   1111.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community
development. Once land has been cut up into streets, lots and blocks and
publicly recorded, the correction of defects is costly and difficult.
Subdivision of land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility in that
roads and streets must be maintained and various public services customary to
urban areas must be provided. The welfare of the entire community is thereby
affected in many important respects. It is therefore to the interest of the
public, the developer and the future owners that subdivisions be conceived,
designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum
standards.
   (b)   The Major Thoroughfare Plan and the following standards guiding the
Planning Commission, are designed to provide for the harmonious development of
the area; to secure a coordinated layout and adequate provision for traffic and
also to secure adequate provision for light, air, recreation, transportation,
water, drainage, sewer and other sanitary facilities.
(Ord. 920. Passed 7-23-56.)
   1111.02 JURISDICTION.
   These regulations shall govern all subdivision of land within the corporate
limits of the City or any other area under the jurisdiction of the Planning
Commission now or hereafter established. Within these Regulations the term
"subdivision" means the division of a tract or parcel of land into two or more
lots, sites or divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale
or building development, and includes resubdivision and, when appropriate to
the context, related to the process of subdividing or the land or area
subdivided. Any owner of land within this area wishing to subdivide land shall
submit to the Planning Commission, a plat of the subdivision according to the
procedures outlined in
Chapter 1115, which plat shall conform to the minimum requirements set forth in
Chapter 1119. Improvements shall be installed as required by
Chapter 1123.
(Ord. 920. Passed 7-23-56.)
CHAPTER 1115
Procedure for Plat Approval
1115.01   Initial and final review and approval required.
1115.02   Informal consultations.
1115.03   Submission to Planning Commission.
1115.04   Preliminary sketch plat.
1115.05   Final plat.

      Plat approval by planning authority - see Ohio R.C. 711.09
   1115.01 INITIAL AND FINAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL REQUIRED.
   The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of two
separate steps. The initial step is the preparation and submission to the
Planning Commission of a preliminary sketch plat of the proposed subdivision.
The Planning Commission shall recommend to Council for approval or disapproval.
The second step is the preparation and submission to the Planning Commission of
a final plat together with required certificates. This final plat becomes the
instrument to be recorded in the office of the County Recorder when duly signed
by the Secretary of the Planning Commission after approval by Council.
(Ord. 920. Passed 7-23-56.)
   1115.02 INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS.
   The subdivider shall consult early and informally with the Planning
Commission and its technical staff for advice and assistance before the
preparation of the preliminary sketch plat and its formal application for
approval. This will enable him to become thoroughly familiar with these
Regulations, the Major Thoroughfare Plan and other official plans or public
improvements which might affect the area. Such informal review should prevent
unnecessary and costly revisions.
(Ord. 920. Passed 7-23-56.)
   1115.03 SUBMISSION TO PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)   Any owner of land lying within the area of jurisdiction of the
Planning Commission wishing to divide such land into two or more lots, sites,
or divisions, for the purpose, either immediate or future, of sale or building
development or wishing to resubdivide for this purpose, shall submit a plan of
such proposed subdivision to the Planning Commission for approval and shall
obtain such approval prior to the filing of his subdivision plat for record.
Any such plat of subdivision shall conform to the minimum standards of design
for the subdivision of land as set forth in
Chapter 1119 and shall be presented in the manner specified in Section
1115.04. No plat of a subdivision of land within the City or any other area
under the jurisdiction of the Planning Commission, now or hereafter
established, shall be filed or recorded by the Recorder of Mercer County
without the approval of the Planning Commission as specified herein.
   (b)   In order to secure review and approval of the Planning Commission of a
proposed subdivision, the prospective subdivider shall, prior to the making of
any street improvements or installations of utilities submit to the Planning
Commission a preliminary sketch plat as provided in Section
1115.04, including complete detailed working drawings covering all
improvements. On approval of the preliminary sketch plat he may proceed with
the preparation of the final plat and other documents required in connection
therein as specified in Section
1115.05.
(Ord. 920. Passed 7-23-56.)
   1115.04 PRELIMINARY SKETCH PLAT.
   (a)   At least five days prior to the meeting at which it is to be
considered the subdivider shall submit to the Planning Commission two copies of
a preliminary sketch plat of the proposed subdivision drawn to a scale of not
less than one inch equals 100 feet.
   (b)   The sketch plat which shall meet the minimum standards of design and
the general requirements for the construction of public improvements as set
forth in
Chapter 1119 shall give the following information insofar as possible:
      (1)   The proposed subdivision name and location, the name and address of
the owner or owners and the name of the designer of the plat who shall be a
registered engineer or surveyor.
      (2)   Date, approximate north point and graphic scale.
      (3)   The location of existing and platted property lines, streets,
buildings, water courses, railroads, sewers, bridges, culverts, drain pipes,
water mains and any public utility easements, the present zoning
classification, if any, both on the land to be subdivided and on the adjoining
land; and the names of adjoining property owners or subdivisions.
      (4)   Plans of proposed utility layouts (sewers, water and electricity)
showing feasible connections to the existing or any proposed individual water
supply and/or sewage disposal system must be approved by the County and/or the
City Health Department.

streets, alleys, easements, parks and other open spaces, reservation, lot
lines, building lines and utilities.
      (6)   Contours at vertical intervals of not more than five feet, except
when specifically not required by the Planning Commission.
      (7)   The acreage of the land to be subdivided.
      (8)   Location sketch map showing relationship of subdivision site to
area.
   (c)   Within sixty days after submission of the preliminary sketch plat, the
Planning Commission shall review it and recommend to Council for its approval
or disapproval, or approval subject to modifications as a basis for the
preparation of the final plat. If a plat is disapproved, reasons for such
disapproval shall be stated in writing. If approved subject to modifications,
the nature of the required modifications will be indicated.
   (d)   The approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning Commission will
not constitute acceptance of the final plat and will not be indicated on the
preliminary sketch plat.
   (e)   Failure of the Planning Commission to act on the preliminary sketch
plat within sixty days shall be deemed approval of this plat.
   (f)   One copy of the sketch plat shall be retained in the Planning
Commission files; the other shall be returned to the subdivider with any
notations at the time of approval or disapproval and the specific changes, if
any, required.
   (g)   The approval of the preliminary sketch plat shall lapse unless a final
plat based thereon is submitted within one year from the date of such approval
unless an extension of time is applied for and granted by the Planning
Commission.
(Ord. 920. Passed 7-23-56.)
   1115.05 FINAL PLAT.
   (a)   The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary sketch
plat as approved, and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only
that portion of the approved preliminary sketch plat which he proposes to
record and develop at the time, provided, however, that such portion conforms
to all requirements of these Regulations.
   (b)   (1)   At least five days prior to the meeting at which it is to be
considered the subdivider shall submit the original drawing in black drawing
ink on mylar and three copies, black and white prints, together with any street

      (2)   The plat shall be drawn to a scale of not more than one inch equals
100 feet on sheets not larger than twenty-four by thirty-six inches or of an
approved size to correspond to local plat book dimensions.
      (3)   When possible, a scale of one inch equals fifty feet should be
used. When more than one sheet is required, an index sheet of the same size
shall be filed showing the entire subdivision with the sheets lettered in
alphabetical order as a key.
   (c)   (1)   The Planning Commission shall approve or disapprove this final
plat and shall submit it to Council for approval or disapproval within thirty
days after its submission. If the plat is disapproved the grounds for
disapproval shall be stated upon the records of the Planning Commission.
      (2)   When the plat has been approved by the Planning Commission and
accepted by Council, the original tracing and one copy shall be returned to the
developer, with the approval of the Planning Commission certified thereon, for
filing with the County Recorder as the official plat of record. After the
filing of the plat either the original or a photostatic copy of same shall be
given to the Planning Commission to be retained in the records of the
Commission.

   1119.01 STREETS.
   (a)   Conformity to the Major Thoroughfare Plan. The location and width of
all streets and roads shall conform to the official Major Thoroughfare Plan
which may include a Major Street Plan within a municipality and/or a Major Road
Plan within an unincorporated area.
   (b)   Relation to Adjoining Street System. The proposed street system shall
extend existing streets or projects at the same or greater width, but in no
case less than the required minimum width.
   (c)   Street Widths. The minimum width of right of way, measured from the
lot line to lot line, shall be as shown on the Major Thoroughfare Plan, or if
not shown on such plan, shall be not less than as follows:
      (1)   On arterial streets and highways, the right of way shall not be
less than eighty to 150 feet as may be required. Arterial streets and highways
are those to be used primarily for fast or heavy traffic and will be located on
the Major Thoroughfare Plan.
      (2)   On collector streets, the right of way shall not be less than sixty
feet. Collector streets are those which carry traffic from minor streets to the
major system of arterial streets and highways and include the principal
entrance streets of a residential development and streets for major circulation
within such a development.
      (3)   On minor residential streets the right of way shall not be less
than fifty feet. Minor streets are those which are used primarily for access to
the abutting residential properties and designed to discourage their use by
through traffic.
      (4)   On marginal access streets the right of way shall not be less than
fifty feet. Marginal access streets are minor streets which are parallel to and
adjacent to arterial streets and highways; and which provide access to abutting
properties and protection from through traffic.
      (5)   On dead-end streets or cul-de-sacs, the right of way shall not be
less than fifty feet. Cul-de-sacs are permanent dead-end streets or courts
designed so that they cannot be extended in the future.
      (6)   On alleys, the right of way shall not be less than sixteen and one-
half feet. Alleys are minor public ways used primarily for service access to
the back or side of properties otherwise abutting on a street.
   In cases where topography or other physical conditions make a street of the
required minimum width impracticable, the Planning Commission may modify these
requirements. Through proposed business areas the street widths shall be
increased ten feet on each side if needed to provide parking without
interference of normal passing traffic.
   (d)   Additional Width on Existing Streets. Subdivisions that adjoin
existing streets shall dedicate additional rights of way to meet the above
minimum street width requirements.
      (1)   The entire right of way shall be provided where any part of the
subdivision is on both sides of the existing street.
      (2)   When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing
street, at least one-half of the required right of way, measured from the
center line of the existing roadway, shall be provided. In no case shall the
resulting right-of-way width be less than fifty feet.
   (e)   Restriction of Access. When a tract fronts on an arterial street or
highway, the Planning Commission may require such lots to be provided with
frontage on a marginal access street.
   (f)   Street Grades. Grades on major streets shall not exceed seven percent
(7%). Grades on other streets may exceed seven percent (7%) but not ten percent
(10%). Minimum grades to be a discretion of the approving authority but in no
case less than twenty-five hundredths of a percent (.025%).
   (g)   Horizontal Curves. Where a deflection angle of more than ten degrees
in the alignment of a street occurs, a curve of reasonably long radius shall be
introduced. On streets sixty feet or more in width, the center line radius of
curvature shall be not less than 300 feet; on other streets not less than 100
feet.
   (h)   Vertical Curves. All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical
curves of minimum length in feet equal to fifteen times the algebraic
difference in rates of grade for major streets and one-half this minimum length
for other streets. Profiles of all streets showing natural and finished grades
drawn to scale of not less than one inch equals 100 feet horizontal, and on
inch equals twenty feet vertical, may be required by the Planning Commission.
   (i)   Intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles
as is possible, and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than sixty
degrees.
   Property line radii at street intersections shall not be less than twenty
feet and where the angle of street intersection is less than seventy-five
degrees the Planning Commission may require a greater curb radius. Wherever
necessary to permit the construction of a curb having a desirable radius
without curtailing the sidewalk at a street corner to less than normal width,
the property line at such street corner shall be rounded or otherwise set back
sufficiently to permit such construction.
   (j)   Tangents. A tangent of at least 100 feet long shall be introduced
between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
   (k)   Street Jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet
shall not be allowed.
   (l)   Dead End Streets.
      (1)   Minor terminal streets or courts designed to have one end
permanently closed shall be no more than 400 feet long unless necessitated by
topography. They shall be provided at the closed end with a turn around having
an outside roadway diameter of at least eighty feet and a street right of way
diameter of at least 100 feet.
      (2)   Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, it is desirable
to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be
extended by dedication to the boundary of such property.
   (m)   Private Streets and Reserve Strips.
      (1)   There shall be no private streets platted in any subdivisions.
Every subdivided property shall be served from a publicly dedicated street.
      (2)   There shall be no reserve strips controlling access to streets,
except where the control of such strips is definitely placed with the community
under conditions approved by the Planning Commission.
   (n)   Street Names.
      (1)   Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with existing
named streets shall bear the names of such streets. In no case shall the names
of proposed streets otherwise duplicate existing street names, regardless of
the use of the suffix of street, avenue, boulevard, circle, drive, place or
court. The Planning Commission can assist the subdivider in avoiding
duplication.
      (2)   The City is basically laid out on a grid system of streets and
streets are named and numbered from Market Street as the North and South base
line street and Main Street as the East and West base line street.
      (3)   Streets which change in direction toward base line streets at an
angle in excess of forty-five degrees shall be named as two streets, at the
point of change of direction with numbers increasing from the base line
streets.
      (4)   Where a circle extends at right angle from a street for a distance
in excess of an average City block before returning to the street from which it
extends, the circle shall be named as two streets and so numbered. Such street
names shall change at the midpoint of the circle.
   (o)   Alleys. Alleys shall be provided to the rear of all lots used for
business purposes, and shall not be provided in residential blocks except where
the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the Planning Commission of the
need for alleys.
(Ord. 920. Passed 7-23-56.)
   1119.02 BLOCKS.
   (a)   Length. Blocks shall not be less than 400 feet nor more than 1200 feet
in length, except as the Planning Commission considers necessary to secure
efficient use of land or desired features of street pattern. In blocks over 800
feet in length, the Planning Commission may require one or more public cross
walks of not less than ten feet in width to extend entirely across the block
and at locations deemed necessary.
   (b)   Width. Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots, except
where fronting on major streets or prevented by topographical conditions or
size of the property, in which case the Planning Commission shall approve a
single tier of lots.
(Ord. 920. Passed 7-23-56.)
   1119.03 LOTS.
   (a)   Arrangements. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right
angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. Each lot must
front upon a public street or road which is not less than fifty feet in width.
   (b)   Minimum Size. The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be such as
the Planning Commission deems appropriate for the type of development and use
contemplated. Where a public sanitary sewer is reasonably accessible, the
subdivider shall connect with such sewer and provide a connection to each lot.
Where a public sewer is not accessible, an alternate method of sewage disposal
may be used, when meeting all applicable public health regulations.
      (1)   Residential lots served by a public sewerage system shall not be
less than sixty feet wide at the building setback line nor less than 6,000
square feet in area.
      (2)   Residential lots not served by a public sewerage system shall not
be less than 100 feet wide at the building line nor less than 15,000 square
feet in area.
         A.   Greater area may be required for private sewage disposal if, in
the opinion of the County Health Officer, there are factors of drainage, soil
condition or other conditions to cause potential health problems. The Planning
Commission may require that data from percolation tests be submitted as a basis
for passing upon subdivisions dependent upon septic tanks as a means of sewage
disposal.
         B.   The minimum size of residential lots to be served by a private
source of water supply shall be determined by the County Health Officer after
investigations of soil conditions, proposed sewerage systems and depth of
ground water.
         C.   Size of properties reserved or laid out for commercial or
industrial properties shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service
and parking facilities required by the type of use and development
contemplated. Platting of individual lots should be avoided in favor of an
overall design of the land to be used for such purposes.
         D.   The size and widths of lots shall in no case be less than the
minimum requirements of any zoning ordinance in effect.
   (c)   Building Setback Lines. The minimum depth of building setback lines
from the street shall not be less than thirty feet and in the case of corner
lots, fifteen feet from the side street unless a lower standard is allowed by
an existing zoning ordinance.
   (d)   Corner lots shall be sufficiently wider and larger to permit the
additional side yard requirements of the Zoning Ordinance or building setback
lines outlined herein.
(Ord. 920. Passed 7-23-56.)
   1119.04 PUBLIC USE AND SERVICE AREAS.
   Due consideration shall be given to the allocation of areas suitably located
and of adequate size for playgrounds and parks for local or neighborhood use as
well as public service areas.
   (a)   Public Open Spaces. Where a school, neighborhood park or recreation
area or public access to water frontage, shown on an official map or in a plan
made and adopted by the Planning Commission, is located in whole or in part in
the applicant's subdivision, the Planning Commission may require the dedication
or reservation of such open space within the subdivision up to a total of ten
percent (10%) of the gross area or water frontage of the plat, for park, school
or recreation purposes.
   (b)   Easements for Utilities.
      (1)   Except where alleys are permitted for the purpose, the Planning
Commission shall require easements, not less than seven and one-half feet nor
more than ten feet in width, for poles, wires, conduits, storm and sanitary
sewers, gas, water and heat mains or other utility lines, along all rear lot
lines and along side lot lines if necessary, or if, in the opinion of the
Planning Commission deemed advisable. Easements of the same or greater width
may be required along the lines of, or across, lots where necessary for the
extension of existing or planned utilities.
      (2)   Public utilities companies shall be consulted for their opinion on
easement locations and widths so as to minimize future difficulties in
servicing. The Safety-Service Director shall present the plan to utilities
companies on behalf of the developer and City.
   (c)   Community Assets. In all subdivisions due regard shall be shown for
all natural features such as large trees, water courses, historical spots and
similar community assets which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value
to the property.
   (d)   Suitability of the Land.
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall not approve the subdivision of land
if, from adequate investigations conducted by all public agencies concerned, it
has been determined that in the best interest of the public the site is not
suitable for platting and development purposes of the kind proposed.
      (2)   Land subject to flooding and land deemed to be topographically
unsuitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy, nor for such other
uses as may increase danger to health, life or property or aggravate erosion or
flood hazard. Such land within the plat shall be set aside for such uses as
shall not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or shall not
produce unsatisfactory living conditions.
   (e)   Large Tracts or Parcels. When land is subdivided into larger parcels
than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for
the opening of future streets and logical further resubdivision.
   (f)   Variances. Where the subdivider can show that a provision of these
standards would cause unnecessary hardship if strictly adhered to, and where,
because of topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site, in the
opinion of the Planning Commission a departure may be made without destroying
the intent of such provisions, the Commission may authorize a variance. Any
variance thus authorized is to be stated in writing in the minutes of the
Planning Commission with the reasoning on which the departure was justified set
forth.
   (g)   Zoning or Other Regulations. No final plat of land within the force
and effect of an existing zoning ordinance will be approved unless it conforms
with such ordinance.
      Whenever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards or dimensions
noted herein and those contained in zoning regulations, building code, or other
official regulations, the highest standard shall apply.

   1123.01 PURPOSE.
   A perfectly prepared and recorded subdivision or plat means little to a
prospective lot buyer until he can see actual physical transformation of raw
acreage into lots suitable for building purposes and human habitation.
Improvements by the subdivider spares the community of a potential tax
liability. The following tangible improvements are required before final plat
approval in order to assure the physical reality of a subdivision which
approval and recordation will establish legally.
(Ord. 920. Passed 7-23-56.)
   1123.02 COMPLIANCE WITH CITY SPECIFICATIONS REQUIRED.
   Every subdivision developer shall be required to grade and improve streets
and alleys, install curbs and sidewalks, monuments, storm and sanitary sewers,
storm water inlets, water mains, street name signs and gas where available in
accordance with specifications established by the City.
(Ord. 920. Pased 7-23-56.)
   1123.03 REGULATIONS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   Covering streets, sanitary sewers, water lines, storm sewers and other
public utilities:
   (a)   Each project shall have a complete set of working drawings and typical
sections covering all the improvements prepared in accordance with the detailed
specifications on file and approved by the Safety-Service Director.
   (b)   All improvements shall be made under supervision of the Safety-Service
Director or his approved representative.
   (c)   Detailed specifications required for all improvements are on file in
the City offices. It would be advisable for each developer to thoroughly
acquaint himself with their requirements before preparation of working plan.
      (Ord. 920. Passed 7-23-56.)
   1123.04 MONUMENTS.
   (a)   Concrete monuments four inches in diameter or square, three feet long,
with a flat top, shall be set at all street corners, at all points where the
street lines intersect the exterior boundaries of the subdivision, and at angle
points and points of curve in each street, the top of the monument shall have
an indented cross or pin wherever it is practical to identify properly the
location and shall be set flush with the finished grade.
   (b)   All other lot corners shall be marked with a standard survey pin or
iron not less than three-fourths inches in diameter and twenty-four inches long
and driven so as to be flush with finished grade.
(Ord. 920. Passed 7-23-56.)
   1123.05 GRADING.
   All streets, roads and alleys shall be graded to their full width by the
subdividers so that pavements and sidewalks can be constructed on the same
level plane. Due to special topographical conditions, deviation from these
standards will be allowed only with special approval of the Planning
Commission.
   (a)   Preparation. Before grading is started the entire right-of-way area
shall be first cleared of all stumps, roots, brush and other objectionable
materials and all trees not intended for preservation.
   (b)   Cuts. All tree stumps, boulders and other obstructions shall be
removed to a depth of two feet below the subgrade. Rock, when encountered,
shall be scarified to a depth of twelve inches below the subgrade.
   (c)   Fill. All suitable material from roadway cuts may be used in the
construction of fills, approaches, or at other places as needed. Excess
materials including organic materials, soft clays, etc., shall be removed from
the development site. The fill shall be spread in layers not to exceed twelve
inches loose and compacted by a sheep's foot roller. The filling of utility
trenches and other places not accessible to a roller shall be mechanically
tamped, but where water is used to assist compaction, the water content shall
not exceed the optimum of moisture.
      (Ord. 920. Passed 7-23-56.)
   1123.06 STORM DRAINAGE.
   (a)   An adequate drainage system, on all streets, including necessary open
ditches, storm sewers, pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets,
bridges, etc., shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water.
Culverts shall be provided to accommodate all natural water flow, and shall be
of sufficient length to permit full width roadway, and the required slopes. The
size openings to be provided shall be determined by Talbot's formula, but in no
case shall the pipe be less than twelve inches. Culverts shall be built on
straight line and grade, and shall be laid on a firm base but not on rock.
Pipes shall be laid with the spigot end pointing in the direction of the flow
and with the ends fitted and matched to provide tight joints and a smooth
uniform invert. They shall be placed at a sufficient depth below the roadbed to
avoid dangerous pressure of impact, and in no case shall the top of the pipe be
less than one foot below the roadbed.
   (b)   Storm sewers shall be either bell and spigot or tongue and grooved
pipe, either clay, concrete or plastic (SDR-35) and shall have a minimum length
of thirty inches per unit. Size of storm sewer shall be approved by the Safety-
Service Director or by the City Engineer, but in no case shall the sewer be
less than eight inches in diameter.
(Ord. 920. Passed 7-23-56.)
   1123.07 ROADWAY SURFACING.
   (a)   The minimum standards for roadway surfacing shall be those detailed in
subsection (1) or (2) hereof.
      (1)   After preparation of the subgrade, the roadbed shall be surfaced
with material required by local standards. The minimum asphalt concrete base
shall be four and one-half inches and the minimum asphalt concrete finish
surface shall be one and one-half inches. All surfacing shall be a minimum six
inches full depth asphalt pavement and be approved by the City.
         All soft spots in subgrade shall be removed and replaced with crushed
stone then compacted before surfacing begins. Drainage for the roadway shall be
provided.
      (2)   As an alternative two courses of compacted asphaltic concrete shall
be constructed on the prepared base, in accordance with these specifications
and in conformity with the lines, grades, designed thickness, typical cross
sections and other details shown on the plans, finished and ready for
acceptance.
            A wearing course of bank or crusher run aggregate shall be placed
on the completed and accepted subgrade or subbase. The aggregate material shall
conform with the requirements of Item 304.02 of the Ohio State Highway
Specifications and be uniformly spread in layers by means of an approved
spreader box or any other method approved by the Engineer.
         (Ord. 20-71-0. Passed 5-24-71.)
            After spreading, the material shall be rolled until thoroughly
compacted. The minimum compacted thickness of the aggregate wearing course
shall not be less than seven inches.
   After compaction of the wearing course, a prime coat of tack coat of
bituminous material shall be applied, followed by the application of two and
one-half inches of asphaltic concrete applied in two separate layers, the first
layer consisting of one and one-quarter inches leveling course. The second
shall be one and one-quarter inches finish or wearing course.
   The asphaltic concrete shall be composed of a mixture of coarse and fine
mineral aggregate and asphalt cement. The several courses shall be of the
composition known as Asphaltic concrete, Item 402, Item 403 or Item 404 as
described in Ohio State Highway Specifications. Drainage for the roadway shall
be provided.
         (Ord. 20-71-0. Passed 5-24-71.)
   1123.08 MINIMUM PAVEMENT WIDTHS.
   Due to the diversity of development in the planning region ranging from
sparsely populated agricultural areas to the densely populated urban areas,
required pavement widths will necessarily vary with the character of building
development and the amount of traffic encountered. Minimum pavement widths
shall be measured from back of curb to back of curb as follows:
   (a)   On minor residential streets the minimum width shall be thirty-two
feet. Most minor streets in the residential developments or rural roads
involving parking and/or considerable traffic.
   (b)   On collector streets the minimum width shall be thirty-six feet,
including minor streets which in the opinion of the Planning Commission will
involve sufficient traffic and/or parking to justify such width.
      (Ord. 10-81-0. Passed 4-13-81.)
   1123.09 CURBS AND GUTTERS.
   The subdivider shall provide permanent six inch concrete curbs with twenty-
four inch integral concrete gutters; except with the approval of the Planning
Commission a roll type curb and gutter may be used on a minor residential
street.
(Ord. 920. Passed 7-23-56.)
   1123.10 SIDEWALKS.
   (a)   For the safety of pedestrians and of children at play, installation by
the developer of sidewalks on both sides of streets will normally be required.
The Commission may waive the requirements of sidewalks where park, railroad or
other use on one side of a street makes a sidewalk nonessential.
   (b)   Sidewalks shall be located not less than one foot from the property
line to prevent interference or encroachment by fencing, walls, hedges or other
planting or structures placed on the property line at a later date. In single-
family residential areas concrete sidewalks shall be four feet wide and four
inches thick. In multi-family or group housing developments sidewalks shall be
five feet wide and ten feet wide in commercial areas.
(Ord. 920. Passed 7-23-56.)
   1123.11 INSTALLATION OF UTILITIES.
   (a)   After grading is completed and approved and before any base is
applied, all of the underground work, water mains, gas mains, etc., and all
service connections shall be installed completely and approved throughout the
length of the road and across the flat section. All driveways for houses to be
built by the developer shall be cut and drained.
   (b)   All utilities shall be placed in streets before roadway surfacing is
attempted. Taps for sewer, water, gas and any other utilities underground shall
be taken to the property line before roadway surfacing is done. This will
protect and preserve streets thus minimizing future repair work.
(Ord. 920. Passed 7-23-56.)
   1123.12 WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM.
   (a)   Water mains properly connected with the community water supply system
or with an alternate supply approved by the County Health Officer shall be
constructed in such a manner as to adequately serve all lots shown on the
subdivision plat for both domestic use and fire protection.
   (b)   The sizes of water mains, the location and types of valves and
hydrants, the amount of soil cover over the pipes and other features of the
installation shall be approved by the Planning Commission and shall conform
with accepted standards of good practice for municipal water systems.
(Ord. 920. Passed 7-23-56.)
   1123.13 SANITARY SEWERS.
   When located within the service area of a public sewerage system sanitary
sewers shall be installed in such a manner as to serve adequately all lots with
connection to the public system. When lots cannot be economically connected
with a sewerage system, they must contain adequate area for the installation of
approved septic tank and disposal fields and must be approved in writing by the
County Health Officer.
(Ord. 920. Passed 7-23-56.)
   1123.14 RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS.
   Although not required by these Regulations, the planting of street trees is
considered a duty of the subdivider as well as good business practices.
   (a)   Street trees are a protection against excessive heat and glare and
enhance the attractiveness and value of abutting property. The Planning
Commission will assist the subdivider in location of trees and species to be
used under varying conditions.
   (b)   It is recommended that trees be planted inside the property lines
where they are less subject to injury, decrease the chance of motor accidents
and enjoy more favorable conditions for growth. If trees are to be planted
within a planting strip in the right of way, their proposed locations and
species to be used must be submitted for the Planning Commission's approval
since the public inherits the care and maintenance of such trees.
      (Ord. 920. Passed 7-23-56.)
   1123.15 GUARANTEES IN LIEU OF COMPLETED IMPROVEMENTS.
   No final subdivision plat shall be approved by the Planning Commission or
accepted for record by the County Recorder until the improvements listed shall
be constructed in satisfactory manner and approved by the local approving
agent, or in lieu of such prior construction, a surety bond has been posted as
provided for under Section K, Paragraph 5 of the Final Plat, whereby
improvements may be made without cost to the City or County in the event of
default of the subdivider.

    Except as hereinafter specified, the lawful use of a building or premises
existing at the time of the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance which would
render the use nonconforming, may be continued although such use, building, or
structure does not conform with the provisions of this Chapter for the district
in which it is located. It is not the intention herein to classify as

reconstructed, substituted, or structurally altered to increase its
nonconformity unless the use thereof is changed to a use permitted in the
district in which such building or premises is located, and except as follows:
   (a)   Enlargement or Substitution: When authorized by the Planning
Commission, in accordance with Section

buildings may be enlarged as long as the building meets all minimal yard
requirements in the district in which it is located.
   Additionally, all such extensions shall not exceed 100% of the floor area of
the structure existing at the time it became nonconforming. All such extensions
on structures nonconforming because of use shall be made within five (5) years
of becoming nonconforming. Extensions may be made on a lot adjoining, provided
that such lot was under the same ownership as the lot in question on the date
such building became nonconforming.

to a nonconforming use. Discontinued shall mean that the structure has remained
vacant, unoccupied, unused or has ceased the daily activities or operations

of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (a)   Prior to making a recommendation on a proposed rezoning, the Planning
Commission shall make a finding to determine if the following conditions exist.
No rezoning of land shall be approved prior to specific documentation finding
at least one (1) of the following:
      (1)   There has been a change in demand for land which alters the
information upon which the Zoning Map is based.
      (2)   A study indicates that there has been an increase in the demand for
land in the requested zoning district, and as a result, the supply of land
within said zoning district is inadequate to meet the demands for such
development.
(3)   Proposed uses cannot be accommodated by sites already zoned in the City
due to lack of transportation or utilities or other development constraints, or
the market to be served by the proposed use cannot be effectively served by the
location of the existing zoning district.
      (4)   There is an error in the Zoning Map as enacted.
   (b)   No residentially zoned land of less than five (5) acres in size shall
be rezoned to a non-residential district unless it is contiguous to land in the

   (c)   In addition to the findings required to be made by subsections (a) and
(b), findings shall be made by the Planning Commission on each of the following
matters based on the evidence presented.

compliance with and deviate from adopted plans, goals and policies.
      (2)   The suitability of the property in question for the uses permitted
under the proposed zoning.
      (3)   The adequacy of public facilities such as transportation,
utilities, and other required public services to serve the proposed use.
      (4)   The effect of the proposed rezoning on surrounding uses.
      (5)   The effect of the proposed rezoning on the economic viability of
existing developed and vacant land within the City.

amendment unless it finds that the adoption of such an amendment is in the
public interest and not solely in the interest of the applicant.

forth in this Chapter, and other pertinent sections of the Zoning Ordinance,
the Planning Commission shall submit the plan with its report and
recommendations to City Council for its review. Council shall set a public
hearing, following the required 30 day public notification process, to review
the plan. If a zoning classification change is being sought concurrently, this
public hearing could incorporate both issues.
      (3)   Following the public hearing, Council may modify the plan, provided
such modification is consistent with the intent and meaning of the Zoning
Ordinance. Any plan approval, in situations where a zoning classification
change is required, will not be effective until such zoning classification
change occurs.
      (4)   After the final development plan is approved by Council, any minor
changes in carrying out this plan, such as adjustments to or rearrangements of
buildings, parking areas, drive entrances, heights or yards, must be approved
by the Planning Commission. These changes must conform to the standards
established by the final development plan and the Zoning Ordinance. Any other
changes must follow the final development plan procedure and receive
authorization by Council.

   1185.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these sign regulations to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare by permitting the use of signs as a means of
communication in the City of Celina:
   (a)   To maintain and enhance the City's natural and manmade environment;
   (b)   To implement community design standards to encourage an attractive and
healthy economic environment;
   (c)   To reduce possible safety hazards to vehicle and pedestrian traffic
through good signage;
   (d)   To minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public and
private property; and
   (e)   To enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign
regulations.
   The purpose, as stated above, is based on the following findings or
conditions concerning signs:
   (a)   That excessive signs create dangerous traffic conditions, intrude on
motorist and pedestrian enjoyment of the natural and manmade beauty of the
City, and as such are detrimental to the public health, safety, and general
welfare of the City; and
   (b)   That business enterprises and other institutions located along public
and private streets have a need to identify themselves and their activities to
motorists and pedestrians by means of signs.

object is of an unsafe nature, it shall be incumbent upon the tenants and/or
the property owners to forthwith remove and/or repair to the satisfaction of
the Director, or his Agent,. Failure to make such repairs shall be cause for

   1341.01 PURPOSE; GENERAL INTERPRETATION.
   (a)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these to promote the public
health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (b)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these Regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (c)   Lands to Which These Apply. These Regulations shall apply to all areas
of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Celina as
identified in subsection (d) hereof, including any additional areas of special
flood hazard annexed by the City of Celina.
   (d)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these Regulations, the following studies and / or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Mercer County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
effective May 16, 2012.
      (2)   Flood Insurance Rate Map Mercer County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
effective May 16, 2012.
      (3)   Other studies and / or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (4)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Celina as required by Section
1341.04(c).
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and / or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Celina Engineering Department at 426 West Market
Street Celina, Ohio.
   (e)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These Regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances (except for Ordinance 9-98-O)
including subdivision, zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict
between these Regulations and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall
be followed. These Regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant
or easement, but the land subject to such interests shall be governed by these
Regulations.
   (f)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
Regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these Regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these Regulations.
   (g)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these Regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These Regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These Regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Celina, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these Regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (h)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these Regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of these Regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 12-12-
O. Passed 3-26-12.)
   1341.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
Regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these Regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure:  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal: A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these Regulations or a request for a
variance.

exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE): The water surface elevation of
the base flood, in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).

   (i)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management):  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (j)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (k)   Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (l)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (m)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:     Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:    Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (p)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (q)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (r)   Floodway:  
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (s)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (t)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (u)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (v)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.
LOMC's are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA):  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR):  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR):  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (w)   Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement or crawlspace) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these Regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (x)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis, and is designed for use with or without
a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these Regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (y)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (z)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management to reduce future flood risks to all development in
special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make flood insurance
available within the community as a financial protection against flood loss.
   (aa)   New construction:  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Celina Flood
Insurance Rate Map, March 18, 1986, and includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures.
   (bb)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   (cc)   Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently tow-able by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Engineer:  A person registered as a
Professional Engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Registered Professional Surveyor:  A person registered as a
Professional Surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (gg)   Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA): Also known as "Areas of Special
Flood Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from
other federal state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (hh)   Start of construction:  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (ii)   Structure:  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (jj)   Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (kk)   Substantial Improvement:  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (ll)   Variance: A grant of relief from the standards of these Regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (mm)   Violation:  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these Regulations.
      (Ord. 12-12-O. Passed 3-26-12.)
   1341.03 ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The Safety-Service
Director (and/or his designee) is hereby appointed to administer and implement
these and is referred to herein as the Floodplain Administrator.

special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these Regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1341.05.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
Regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these ;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
Regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these Regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway, if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A.1. to 11.
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator (or his designee) may present evidence
or testimony in opposition to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A fee as established by the City Council of Celina
shall be imposed to cover the cost of issuance and service and shall be
collected in advance of such issuance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing within ten (10) business days or the decision may
be issued in writing within sixty (60) days after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Mercer County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 12-12-O. Passed 3-26-12.)
   1341.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these and all other applicable
Regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these Regulations,
unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit as stated in
Section
1341.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these Regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
subsection (c) hereof.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these Regulations and punishable in
accordance with subsection (c) hereof.
   (b)   Notice of Violation. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines

of these Regulations that have been violated, and order remedial action which,
if taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of these Regulations;
      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
      (5)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this

or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
Regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a third degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these Regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of the City of Celina. Each day such violation continues
shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the City of Celina from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to
prevent or remedy any violation. The City of Celina shall prosecute any
violation of these Regulations in accordance with the penalties stated herein.

   1351.06 FIRE DAMAGED STRUCTURE REMOVAL; REPAIR SECURING FUND.
   The City is hereby authorized to utilize the procedure described in Ohio

State shall pay a claim of the named insured for fire damage to a structure
located within the City where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the
structure under all policies exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000) unless
there is compliance with the following procedures:
   (a)   (1)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or and the
company or companies equals or exceeds percent the aggregate limits of
liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure, the
insurance company or companies, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 715.26(F) or Ohio
R.C. 505.86, shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Building
Inspector in the aggregate two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) for each fifteen
thousand dollars ($15,000.00), and each fraction of that amount, of a claim.
However, if, at the time of a proof of loss agreed to between the named insured
or insureds and the insurance company or companies, the named insured or
insureds have submitted a contractor's signed of the costs of removing,
repairing or securing the building or other structure, then the insurance
company or companies shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the amount
specified in estimate.
      (2)   The Building Inspector or his or her designee shall establish the
criteria for securing such structure and/or such property.
      (3)   The transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all
insuring the building or other structure. Policy proceeds remaining after the
transfer to the City shall be disbursed in accordance with the policy terms.
      (4)   The named insured or insureds may submit a contractor's signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure. After the transfer, the Building Inspector shall return the amount
of the fund in excess of the estimate to the named insured or insureds,
provided that the City has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the
building or other structure.
   (b)   (1)   Upon receipt of proceeds by the City as authorized by this
section, the Building Inspector shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to
be used solely as security against the total cost of removing, repairing or
securing incurred by the City pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261.
      (2)    When transferring the funds as required in subsection (a) hereof,
an insurance company shall provide the City with the name and address of the
named insured or insureds, whereupon the City shall contact the named insured
or insureds, certify that the proceeds have been received by the City, and

returned to the named insured or insureds when repairs, removal or securing of
the building or other structure has been completed and the required proof has
been received by the Building Inspector. If the City has not incurred any costs
for such repairs, removal or securing, the City shall transfer the fund to the
named insured or insureds no later than sixty (60) calendar days after the
Building Inspector receives the required proof that the building or other
structure has been repaired, removed or secured as to prevent unauthorized
entry into the structure and/or onto the property itself. If the City has
incurred any costs for the repairs, removal or securing of the building or
other structure, such costs shall be paid from the fund, and if excess funds
remain, the Building Inspector shall transfer the remaining funds to the named
insured or insureds no later than sixty (60) calendar days after all such costs
incurred by the City have been paid. Nothing in this section shall be construed
to limit the ability of the City to recover any deficiency under Ohio R.C.
715.261. Required proof, for the purpose of this section, shall mean that the
building or structure has been secured in accordance with the criteria
established by the Building Inspector or his or her designee to prevent
unauthorized entry into such building or structure and/or onto said property.
      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the City
and the named insured or insureds from entering into an agreement that permits
the transfer of funds to the named insured or insureds if some other reasonable
disposition of the damaged property has been negotiated.
   (c)   The Building Inspector of the City is hereby designated as the officer
authorized and directed to carry out the duties of this section. The Building
Inspector shall file a certified copy of this section with the Superintendent
of Insurance of the State.

exists or existed, to be added to the tax duplicate as an assessment, to be
levied as a special tax against the land upon which the building exists or
existed or to be recovered in a suit at law against the owner. However, the
Building Inspector and/or his designee(s) may, in cases where it is desirable

derived in the abatement, he may sell such material at private or public sale
at the best price obtainable and shall keep an account of the proceeds thereof.
Such proceeds, if any, shall be deposited in the General Fund. Any difference
between the amount so received and the cost of the abatement shall be levied as
an assessment against the property by Council, certified to the County Auditor
and collected as any other assessment by the City. Should the proceeds of such
sale exceed the cost of abatement, the surplus shall be paid to the owner of
the premises when his proper claim therefor is established. In abating such
nuisance, the Building Inspector may, by private contract, obtain the abatement
thereof, if such private contract may be let without any expense to the City.

shall cause the immediate repair, vacation or demolition of such dangerous
building. The cost of such emergency repair, vacation or demolition shall be
collected in the manner provided in Section
1351.09.

   In all cases, except emergency cases, persons having an interest in real
estate upon which a dangerous building is situated, including but not limited
to the owner, shall be notified by one of the methods provided in the Ohio
Rules of Civil Procedure. In the event that the address of a person cannot be
ascertained with reasonable diligence, publication of notice shall be made once

   1351.13 CODE NOT EXCLUSIVE.

the authority of any department, division, official or employee of the City,
but shall be deemed as an enlargement of any authority existing by virtue of
State law or any ordinance heretofore enacted by Council. (Ord. 14-12-O. Passed
4-23-12.)
   1351.14 SEPARABILITY.
   It is the intention of Council that each separate provision of this chapter
be deemed independent of all other provisions hereof. It is further the
intention of Council that if any provision of this chapter is declared invalid,
all other provisions shall remain valid and enforceable.

period. The Inspector shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers
pertaining to the decision from which the appeal was made.
(Ord. 14-12-O. Passed 4-23-12.)

       (1)   That the order is contrary to the Building Code and any rule or
regulation made thereunder or contrary to a fair interpretation or application

rule or regulation made thereunder, in the specific case, will not be contrary
