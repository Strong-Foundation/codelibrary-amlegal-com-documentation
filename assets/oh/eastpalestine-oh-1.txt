PREAMBLE
   We the people of the Municipality of East Palestine, County of Columbiana

by detachment, annexation, or any other means authorized by the general laws of
the State of Ohio.
Section 1.02   Form of Government.
   The form of government established by this Charter shall be known as the

   All powers of municipal government shall be exercised in the manner
prescribed in this Charter, or if not prescribed herein, in such manner as
shall be provided by ordinance, resolution, or other action of the Council. In
the event that the manner of exercise of any such power shall neither be
prescribed by this Charter, nor provided by ordinance, resolution, or other
action of the Council, then such power shall be exercised in the manner
provided by the general laws of the State of Ohio.
Section 2.03   Construction of the Charter.
   The provisions of this Charter shall be construed liberally so as to provide
the broadest possible exercise of powers of local self-government and home-rule
consistent with the Constitution of the State of Ohio, and the Constitution of

particular powers shall not be by way of limitation.
ARTICLE III

3.14 of this Charter.
Section 3.02   Qualifications.

but shall not thereby cease to be a councilman; and the acting Mayor-President
of Council shall retain the right to vote on any and all measures coming before

as President Pro Tempore of Council shall become vacant. When the President Pro
Tempore of Council is absent or inaccessible, or for any other reason unable to
perform his duties as acting Mayor-President of Council, then the Council, by

invalidate or otherwise affect any action taken by the Council or any other
officer, employee, agent or independent contractor of the Municipality. All
such blueprints, maps, or other records shall be available for public
inspection at all reasonable times; provided, however, that the non-
availability of such blueprints, maps or other records shall not invalidate or
otherwise affect any action taken by the Council or any other officer,
employee, agent or independent contractor of the Municipality.

appointment within the Municipal Corporation.
   The Council shall provide a replacement when the Clerk of Council is absent.

ARTICLE IV
LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURE, ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS
Section 4.01   Action to be Taken by Ordinance or Resolution.
   Action of Council shall be by ordinance, resolution or motion. Every action
of a general and permanent nature, or granting a franchise, or levying a tax;
or apportioning money; or contracting an indebtedness to be evidenced by the
issuance of bonds or notes; or for the purchase, lease or transfer of public
property; or establishing an offense and fixing the penalty therefor shall be
taken by ordinance, in the manner hereinafter provided. All other action may be
taken by resolution or motion.
Section 4.02   Introduction of Ordinances and Resolutions.
   Subject to the restrictions contained in Section

by the Council of the Municipality of East Palestine, Columbiana County, Ohio";

resolved by the Council of the Municipality of East Palestine, Columbiana
County, Ohio".
Section 4.04   Subject of Ordinances and Resolutions.
   Each ordinance or resolution shall contain only one subject, which subject
shall be clearly expressed in its title; provided, however, that appropriation
ordinances may contain the various subjects, accounts, and amounts for which
monies are to be appropriated; and that ordinances and resolutions which are
codified or recodified shall not be subject to the limitation of one subject.
Section 4.05   Reading of Non-Emergency Ordinances and Resolutions.
   Except as otherwise provided in Section
4.07 hereof, each ordinance shall be read at three (3) meetings of the Council,
whether regular or special, providing that the meetings be held on three (3)
different days; and each resolution shall be read at one (1) meeting of the
Council. Each resolution shall be read in its entirety; but each ordinance
shall be read in its entirety at its first reading only; and the subsequent
readings shall be by title only; provided, however, that the Council may
require any reading to be in full by a majority vote of all of its members. The
Council may dispense with the requirement that a resolution be read in its
entirety, or that an ordinance be read in its entirety at its first reading,
and permit such reading to be by title only upon unanimous affirmative vote of
all of its members present at such meeting. Council may, by a majority of all
its members, suspend the rule requiring the reading of each ordinance on three
(3) different days, declaring such ordinance an emergency and proceed as noted
in Section
4.07.

Motions.
   The vote on the question of passage of each ordinance, resolution, or motion
shall be taken by yeas and nays and entered upon the journal. Each ordinance,

Constitution and general laws of the State of Ohio.
Section 4.07   Emergency Ordinances and Resolutions; Procedure.
   An emergency ordinance or resolution shall contain the determination that
such ordinance or resolution is necessary for the immediate preservation of the
public peace, health, safety, or welfare; and the reasons for such necessity
shall be clearly set forth in one (1) section thereof. Each emergency ordinance
or resolution may be read in its entirety at at least one (1) meeting of the
Council, whether regular or special. The passage of an emergency ordinance or
resolution shall require the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths (3/4)
of all the members of the Council. In the event that a proposed emergency
ordinance or resolution shall fail to receive the affirmative vote of at least
three-fourths (3/4) of all the members of the Council required for its passage
as an emergency measure; then, in that event, the emergency clause shall be
deleted from said legislation, and such legislation shall be deemed to have
received its first reading; and its passage shall be controlled by Section
4.05 hereof. Nothing contained in this section or Section 4.05 shall preclude
the amendment of any ordinance or resolution at any time so as to become an
emergency measure hereunder.

public improvement, this section shall apply only to the first ordinance or
other measure required to be passed and not to any subsequent ordinances and
other measures relating thereto.
   b.   All ceremonial ordinances or resolutions shall go into effect
immediately on passage.
Section 4.09   Authentication of Ordinances and Resolutions.
   Each ordinance or resolution enacted by the Council shall be authenticated
by the signature of the Mayor-President of Council and the Clerk of Council;
however, the failure or refusal of such officers to sign such ordinances or
resolutions shall not act to invalidate an otherwise validly enacted ordinance
or resolution.
Section 4.10   Recording of Ordinances and Resolutions.
   Each ordinance or resolution shall be recorded in a book, or other record
prescribed by the Council, established and maintained by the Clerk of Council
for that purpose. The Clerk of Council, or a duly authorized deputy to said
Clerk, shall, upon the request of any person, and upon the payment of a fee as
established by the Council, certify and deliver true copies of any ordinance or
resolution which certified copies shall be admissible as evidence in any Court.
Section 4.11   Amendment of Ordinances and Resolutions.
   No ordinance or resolution or any section thereof shall be revised or
amended unless the legislation revising or amending contains the entire
paragraph or subparagraph of the ordinance, resolution, or section thereof in
its amended or revised form; and the ordinance, resolution or section thereof
so revised or amended shall be repealed. This requirement shall not prevent the
amendment of an ordinance or resolution by the addition of a new section,
sections, subsection, or subsections; and in such case, the full text of the
former ordinance or resolution need not be set forth. This requirement shall
not prevent repeal by implication in the case of subsequent enactment of

resolutions, a separate vote shall be taken on each ordinance or resolution
proposed to be amended.
   Ordinances and resolutions that have been introduced may be amended or
revised by a majority vote of all of the members of the Council at any time
prior to a vote on passage thereof; and such ordinance or resolution as amended
or revised need not receive three (3) additional readings under Section

   Each ordinance or resolution establishing, amending, revising, changing or

referred to the Planning Commission immediately after its first reading. Within
thirty (30) days of such referral, the Planning Commission shall cause such
ordinance or resolution to be returned to the Clerk of Council together with
the written recommendations of the majority of the members of such commission.
   No such ordinance or resolution which violates or differs or departs from
the written recommendation of the Planning Commission shall take effect unless
passed and approved by a vote of not less then three-fourths (3/4) of all the
members of the Council. This provision shall not be construed to mean that an
ordinance or resolution recommended for passage by the Planning Commission
shall be passed by less than the votes required by Section
4.06 of this Charter.
Section 4.13   Public Hearing on Zoning Ordinances and Resolutions.
   The Mayor-President of Council or other presiding officer of the Council
shall set a date for a public hearing on each ordinance or resolution

districts, uses, or regulations, which hearing shall be after the thirty (30)
day period provided in Section 4.12 within which the Planning Commission is
required to return its written recommendations to the Clerk of Council. The
Clerk of Council shall cause a notice of such public hearing to be published
one time in a newspaper determined by the Council to be of circulation within
the Municipality at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of such public
hearing; and when such amendment, revision, change, or repeal involves ten (10)
or less parcels of land, as listed on the tax duplicate, written notice of the

receipt, at least fifteen (15) days before the date of the public hearing to
the owners of property within, contiguous to and directly across the street
from such parcel or parcels to the addresses of such owners appearing on the
County Auditor's current tax list or the County Treasurer's mailing list and to
such other lists as may be required by the Council. The failure of delivery of
such notice shall not invalidate any such ordinance or resolution.
   During such fifteen (15) days, the text or copy of the text of such
ordinance or resolution, together with the maps or plans, or copies thereof,
forming part of or referred to in such ordinance or resolution; and the maps,
plans, and reports submitted by the Planning Commission shall be on file, for
public examination, in the office of the Clerk of Council or in such other
office as in designated by the Council.
Section 4.14   Adoption of Technical Codes by Reference.
   Council may, by ordinance, adopt standard ordinances and codes prepared by
the Federal government or any agency thereof, the State or any department,
board or other agency or political subdivision of the State, or any standard or
model ordinance or code prepared and promulgated by a public or private
organization, including, but not limited to, codes and regulations pertaining
to fire, fire hazards or fire prevention, plumbing code, electrical code,
building code refrigeration machinery code, piping code, boiler code, heating
code, air conditioning code, housing code, and such other matters as the
Council may determine to be appropriate for adoption by reference, by

or code shall make reference to the date and source of such standard ordinance
or code without reproducing the same at length in the ordinance. In such cases,
publication of the standard ordinance or code shall not be required, but at
least one (1) copy of such code shall be kept at all times in the office of the
Clerk of Council and available for reference by interested persons. If the
standard ordinance or code, after its adoption by reference by the Council, is
amended, the Council may adopt the amendment or change by incorporation by
reference in an ordinance under the same procedure as is established herein for
the adoption of the original standard ordinance or code without the necessity
of setting forth in full in the ordinance the provisions either of the
amendment or change to the original ordinance or the standard ordinance or
code.

4.16 of this Charter shall be satisfied by the publication of the adopting
ordinance only, providing such adopting ordinance shall clearly identify such
standard ordinance or code adopted thereby; shall state the purpose of the
standard ordinance or code; shall state that a complete copy of such standard
ordinance or code is on file with the Clerk of Council and is available for

recodified, rearranged, or published in book form. Such revision, codification,
recodification, rearrangement, or publication of ordinances and resolutions in
book form shall be immediately effective upon affirmative vote of a majority of
all of the members of the Council, and may contain new matter therein. The
Clerk of Council shall cause a notice of such proposed revision, codification,
recodification, rearrangement, or publication of ordinances and resolutions in
book form to be published one (1) time in a newspaper determined by the Council
to be of general circulation within the Municipality at least seven (7) days
prior to the final approval thereof by the Council, which approval shall be
necessary. Such notice shall contain the title of the approving ordinance.

publication on the part of a newspaper, its officers, employees or agents,
shall not cause such ordinance or resolution to be declared invalid, or
otherwise affect the validity of such ordinance or resolution, and in such
events the Clerk of Council may post or authorize publication at a later date.

provided, the Clerk of Council shall affix the appropriate following

Director may hold any other administrative office or position of employment
with the Municipality, except he shall not act as the Municipal Attorney. If a

Section 8.05   Recall Elections.
   The electors shall have the power to remove from office by a recall election
any elected official of the Municipality who has served at least six (6) months
of the term to which he was elected or appointed, by filing a petition
demanding his removal with the Clerk of Council, who shall note thereon the
name and address of the person filing the petition and the date the petition is
filed, and the Clerk of Council shall issue a receipt to the person filing the
petition and shall attach a copy of such receipt to the petition. The form,
sufficiency and regularity of any such petition shall be determined as provided
in the general election laws. The petition may be circulated in separate parts,
but such separate parts shall be bound together and filed as one instrument.
Each part shall contain the name and office of the person whose removal is
sought and a statement, in not more than two hundred (200) words, of the
alleged grounds or reasons for the removal. Such petition shall be signed by at
least that number of electors of the Municipality which equals twenty-five
percent (25%) of the total votes cast for the office of Mayor at the last
preceding regular Municipal election at which a Mayor is elected. Within ten
(10) days after the day on which such petition shall have been filed, the Clerk
of Council shall determine whether or not the petition meets the requirements
hereof. If the Clerk of Council shall find the petition insufficient, he shall
promptly certify the particulars in which the petition is defective and deliver
a copy of such certificate to the person who filed the petition and make a
record of such delivery. Such person shall be allowed a period of twenty (20)
days after the day of such delivery in which to make the petition sufficient by
the amendment. If the Clerk of Council shall find the petition or the amended
petition sufficient, he shall promptly certify such finding to the Council,
shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the person whose removal is sought,
and shall make a record of such delivery. If such person sought to be removed
shall not resign within five (5) days after such delivery to him, the Council
shall thereafter fix a day for holding a recall election, not less than sixty
(60) days or more than seventy-five (75) days after the date of such delivery.
Such recall election may be at a regular Municipal election, a primary
election, or a special election, and such special election may be on the same
day fixed by law for a general election or primary election, or on any other
day established by Council. The Clerk of Council shall certify to the Board of
Elections that an election is to be held on the question of the removal of the
accused official on the date fixed by Council as hereinbefore provided, and the
Clerk of Council shall cause notice of such election to be published on the
same day of each week for two (2) consecutive weeks in a newspaper determined
by said Clerk to be of general circulation in the Municipality if such election
is to be held on a day which is not the day of a regular Municipal or primary
election or of a general or primary election held in even numbered years. At
such election this question shall be placed on the ballot: "Shall (naming the
person whose removal is sought) be allowed to continue as (name the office held
by such person)?", with provision being made on the ballot for voting "yes" or
"no" on such question. If a majority of the votes cast shall be voted
negatively, such officer shall be considered as removed, his office shall be
vacant, and such vacancy shall be filled in the manner provided in this
Charter. The person removed by such recall election shall not be eligible for
appointment to fill the vacancy created thereby; however, said removal shall
not bar such person from becoming a candidate for office of the Municipality at
any subsequent election. If that person is not removed at such recall election,
then additional recall petitions shall not be filed seeking his removal for a
period of one (1) year following such election. The removal of any officer
under the provisions of this section shall not affect the validity of any
ordinance, resolution or other action in which such officer shall have
participated.

CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time from
2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in
October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio Legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.

Identity Theft Prevention Program
210.01   Program adoption.
210.02   Program purpose and definitions.
210.03   Identification of red flags.
210.04   Detecting red flags.
210.05   Preventing and mitigating identity theft.
210.06   Program updates.
210.07   Program administration.
210.01 PROGRAM ADOPTION.
   The City of East Palestine ("Utility") developed this Identity Theft
Prevention Program ("Program") pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission's Red
Flags Rule ("Rule"), which implements Section 114 of the Fair and Accurate
Credit Transactions Act of 2003. 16 C. F. R. § 681.2. This program was
developed with oversight and approval of the City Council. After consideration
of the size and complexity of the Utility's operations and account systems, and
the nature and scope of the Utility's activities, the City Council determined
that this program was appropriate for the City of East Palestine, and therefore
approved this program effect November 1, 2008.
(Res. 17-2009-R. Passed 9-28-09.)
210.02 PROGRAM PURPOSE AND DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   Fulfilling requirements of the reg flags rule. Under the red flag
rule, every financial institution and creditor is required to establish an
"Identity Theft Prevention Program" tailored to its size, complexity and the
nature of its operation. Each program must contain reasonable policies and
procedures to:
      (1)   Identify relevant red flags for new and existing covered accounts
and incorporate those red flags into the program;
      (2)   Detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program;
      (3)   Respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent
and mitigate identity theft; and
      (4)   Ensure the program is updated periodically, to reflect changes in
risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the creditor from identity
theft.
   (b)   Red flags rule definitions used in this program. The red flags rule
defines "Identity Theft" as "fraud committed using the identifying information
of another person" and a "Red Flag" as a pattern, practice, or specific
activity that indicates the possible existence of identity theft.
      (1)   According to the rule, a municipal utility is a creditor subject to
the rule requirements. The rule defines creditors "to include finance
companies, automobile dealers, mortgage brokers, utility companies, and
telecommunications companies. Where non-profit and government entities defer
payment for goods or services, they, too, are to be considered creditors."
      (2)   All the Utility's accounts that are individual utility service
accounts held by customers of the Utility whether residential, commercial or
industrial are covered by the rule. Under the rule, a "covered account" is:
         A.   Any account the Utility offers or maintains primarily for
personal, family or household purposes, that involves multiple payments or
transactions; and
         B.   Any other account the Utility offers or maintains for which there
is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and soundness of
the Utility from identity theft.
      (3)   "Identifying information" is defined under the rule as "any name or
number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to
identify a specific person," including: name, address, telephone number, social
security number, date of birth, government issued driver's license or
identification number, alien registration number, government passport number,
employer or taxpayer identification number, unique electronic identification
number, computer's internet protocol address, or routing code.
(Res. 17-2009-R. Passed 9-28-09.)
210.03 IDENTIFICATION OF RED FLAGS.
   In order to identify relevant red flags, the Utility considers the types of
accounts that it offers and maintains, the methods it provides to open its
accounts, the methods it provides to access its accounts, and its previous
experiences with identity theft. The Utility identifies the following red
flags, in each of the listed categories:
   (a)   Notifications and warnings from credit reporting agencies.
      Red flags
      (1)   Report of fraud accompanying a credit report;
      (2)   Notice or report from a credit agency of a credit freeze on a
customer or applicant;
      (3)   Notice or report from a credit agency of an active duty alert for
an applicant; and
      (4)   Indication from a credit report of activity that is inconsistent
with a customer's usual pattern or activity.
   (b)   Suspicious documents.
      Red flags
      (1)   Identification document or card that appears to be forged, altered
or inauthentic;
      (2)   Identification document or card on which a person's photograph or
physical description is not consistent with the person presenting the document;
      (3)   Other document with information that is not consistent with
existing customer information (such as if a person's signature on a check
appears forged); and
      (4)   Application for service that appears to have been altered or
forged.
   (c)   Suspicious personal identifying information.
      Red flags
      (1)   Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with other
information the customer provides (example: inconsistent birth dates);
      (2)   Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with other
sources of information (for instance, an address not matching an address on a
credit report);
      (3)   Identifying information presented that is the same as information
shown on other applications that were found to be fraudulent;
      (4)   Identifying information presented that is consistent with
fraudulent activity (such as an invalid phone number or fictitious billing
address);
      (5)   Social security number presented that is the same as one given by
another customer;
      (6)   An address or phone number presented that is the same as that of
another person;
      (7)   A person fails to provide complete personal identifying information
on an application when reminded to do so (however, by law social security
numbers must not be required); and
      (8)   A person's identifying information is not consistent with the
information that is on file for the customer.
   (d)   Suspicious account activity or unusual use of account.
      Red Flags
      (1)   Change of address for an account followed by a request to change
the account holder's name;
      (2)   Payments stop on an otherwise consistently up-to-date account;
      (3)   Account used in a way that is not consistent with prior use
(example: very high activity);
      (4)   Mail sent to the account holder is repeatedly returned as
undeliverable;
      (5)   Notice to the Utility that a customer is not receiving mail sent by
the Utility;
      (6)   Notice to the Utility that an account has unauthorized activity;
      (7)   Breach in the Utility's computer system security; and
      (8)   Unauthorized access to or use of customer account information.
   (e)   Alerts from others.
      Red Flag
      (1)   Notice to the Utility from a customer, identity theft victim, law
enforcement or other person that it has opened or is maintaining a fraudulent
account for a person engaged in Identity Theft.
(Res. 17-2009-R. Passed 9-28-09.)
210.04 DETECTING RED FLAGS.
   (a)   New accounts. In order to detect any of the red flags identified above
associated with the opening of a new account, Utility personnel will take the
following steps to obtain and verify the identity of the person opening the
account:
      Detect
      (1)   Require certain identifying information such as name, date of
birth, residential or business address, principal place of business for an
entity, driver's license or other identification;
      (2)   Verify the customer's identity (for instance, review a driver's
license or other identification card);
      (3)   Review documentation showing the existence of a business entity;
and
      (4)   Independently contact the customer.
   (b)   Existing accounts. In order to detect any of the red flags identified
above for an existing account, Utility personnel will take the following steps
to monitor transactions with an account:
      Detect
      (1)   Verify the identification of customers if they request information
(in person, via telephone, via facsimile, via email);
      (2)   Verify the validity of requests to change billing addresses; and
      (3)   Verify changes in banking information given for billing and payment
purposes.
(Res. 17-2009-R. Passed 9-28-09.)
210.05 PREVENTING AND MITIGATING IDENTITY THEFT
   In the event Utility personnel detect any identified red flags, such
personnel shall take one or more of the following steps, depending on the
degree of risk posed by the red flag:
   (a)   Prevent and mitigate.
      (1)   Continue to monitor an account for evidence of identity theft;
      (2)   Contact the customer;
      (3)   Change any passwords or other security devices that permit access
to accounts;
      (4)   Not open a new account;
      (5)   Close an existing account;
      (6)   Reopen an account with a new number;
      (7)   Notify the City Manager for determination of the appropriate step
(s) to take;
      (8)   Notify law enforcement; or
      (9)   Determine that no response is warranted under the particular
circumstances.
   (b)   Protect customer identifying information. In order to further prevent
the likelihood of identity theft occurring with respect to Utility accounts,
the Utility will take the following steps with respect to its internal
operating procedures to protect customer identifying information:
      (1)   Ensure that its website is secure or provide clear notice that the
website is not secure;
      (2)   Ensure complete and secure destruction of paper documents and
computer files containing customer information;
      (3)   Ensure that office computers are password protected and that
computer screens lock after a set period of time;
      (4)   Keep offices clear of papers containing customer information;
      (5)   Request only the last four digits of social security numbers (if
any);
      (6)   Ensure computer virus protection is up to date; and
      (7)   Require and keep only the kinds of customer information that are
necessary for utility purposes.
(Res. 17-2009-R. Passed 9-28-09.)
210.06 PROGRAM UPDATES.
   This program will be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect changes in
risks to customers and the soundness of the Utility from identity theft. At
least every five years, the City Manager will consider the Utility's
experiences with identity theft situation, changes in identity theft methods,
changes in identity theft detection and prevention methods, changes in types of
accounts the Utility maintains and changes in the Utility's business
arrangements with other entities. After considering these factors, the City
Manager will determine whether changes to the program, including the listing of
red flags, are warranted. If warranted, the City Manager will update the
program.
(Res. 17-2009-R. Passed 9-28-09.)
210.07 PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Oversight. Responsibility for developing, implementing and updating
this program lies with an Identity Theft Committee for the Utility. The
Committee is headed by a Program Administrator who shall be the City Manager or
his or her appointee. Two or more other individuals appointed by the City
Manager comprise the remainder of the committee membership. The City Manager
will be responsible for the program administration, for ensuring appropriate
training of Utility staff on the program, for reviewing any staff reports
regarding the detection of red flags and the steps for preventing and
mitigating identity theft, determining which steps of prevention and mitigation
should be taken in particular circumstances and considering periodic changes to
the program.
   (b)   Staff training and reports. Utility staff responsible for implementing
the program shall be trained either by or under the direction of the City
Manager in the detection of red flags, and the responsive steps to be taken
when a red flag is detected.
   (c)   Service provider arrangements. In the event the Utility engages a
service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more
accounts, the Utility will take the following steps to ensure the service
provider performs its activity in accordance with reasonable policies and
procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity
theft.
      (1)   Require, by contract, that service providers have such policies and
procedures in place; and
      (2)   Require, by contract, that service providers review the Utility's
program and report any red flags to the City Manager.
   (d)   Specific program elements and confidentiality. For the effectiveness
of identity theft prevention programs, the red flag rule envisions a degree of
confidentiality regarding the Utility's specific practices relating to identity
theft detection, prevention and mitigation. Therefore, under this program,
knowledge of such specific practices are to be limited to the identity theft
committee and those employees who need to know them for purposes of preventing
identity theft. Because this program is to be adopted by a public body and thus
publicly available, it would be counterproductive to list these specific
practices here. Therefore, only the program's general red flag detection,
implementation and prevention practices are listed in this document.

the securities on deposit with the Trustee, provided that the value of the
securities delivered shall not exceed the amount necessary to produce an amount
equal to the City deposits made and not paid over, less the portions of such
deposits covered by the FDIC, plus any accrued interest due on the deposits. In
any event, the value of such securities shall not exceed the City's
proportional interest in the market value of the pool as of the date of the
depository's failure to pay over the deposits. The Director shall have the
option to sell the securities in such manner as determined by the Director. Any
surplus remaining after deducting the amount due the City and expenses of the
sale shall be paid to the depository.
      (5)   Within thirty days of the end of each calendar quarter, the Trustee
shall provide a detailed statement setting forth the face and market values of
all securities pledged to the pool and the total of all public funds on
deposit.
      (6)   If at any time the market value of the pool is less than 110
percent of all public deposits held by the Trustee, the depository shall
immediately add securities to the pool sufficient to bring the market value of
the pool to at least 110 percent of all public funds on deposit with the
Trustee.

years. Each request for proposals shall contain the following:
      (1)   A statement which provides that to ensure that the City will

in future years.

maintain the depository agreement in good standing.

Council.

($40.00) shall be added to any payment due to the Municipality, when any check
or ACH transfer is dishonored or declined or is otherwise returned unpaid by
the bank or respective financial institution, in payment of any fee, tax,
expense reimbursement, penalty or interest due to the Municipality. Such charge
shall offset the cost of additional bookkeeping and processing and shall be

her bank or respective financial institution. Notice by the Finance Director to

Employees with ten or more years of service with the Village may have the
option to convert one week or forty hours of vacation for one week or forty

the anniversary of the employee's commencement of employment with the Village.

basis calculated on the number of hours they are regularly scheduled to work on

Appointing Authority. Any such authorization will not be habitual and will
require documented justification by the requesting employee. Under no
circumstances is the Appointing Authority required to grant such extension.
Should such extension be granted, the time which was carried over should be
used as soon as is practicable but no later than sixty days from the beginning
of the calendar year.

year of service.

possible so as not to interfere with the efficient operation of the Village.
The Appointing Authority shall schedule vacations in accordance with workload
requirements and the Appointing Authority reserves the right to deny vacation
requests if workload requirements so mandate.

TITLE TEN - Judicial
   Chap.
290. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 290
Mayor's Court
EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor-President of Council
of East Palestine has jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for
the violation of an East Palestine ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all
criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State highways
located within the corporate limits of East Palestine, subject to the
limitations of Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and 2938.04. In keeping his docket and file,
the Mayor-President of Council shall be governed by the laws pertaining to
county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him, waives a jury and
consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such event, does
not waive right to jury trial, then the magistrate shall require the accused to
enter into recognizance to appear before a court of record in Columbiana County
and the magistrate shall thereupon certify all papers filed, together with a
transcript of proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such recognizance, if
given, to the court of record.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that right to trial by jury shall be
claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the clerk
of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for trial
or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for trial,
whichever is the later. Failure to claim jury trial as provided herein is a
complete waiver of right thereto. Jury trial may not be had in courts not of
record, but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial
may be asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of
record as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R. C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a
jury at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
East Palestine ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does
not exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated "Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas, " the adoption of which became mandatory prior to
   Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor's Courts were authorized to
suspend the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section
434.01 of the Traffic Code (OVI), in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4507.16(B).

a written plea of guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the
duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio Director of
Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes the course,
the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of $100, so long as the offender submits to the court both the
offender’s payment in full and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine

         B.   1.   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is
convicted of the violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties
provided by law, may impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may
impose the additional fine of not more than $100.
            2.   If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty
for the violation and an additional fine of not more than $100, the court shall
inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine of not more
than $100, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted driving
safety course described in division (b)(2)A. of this section. If the offender
elects the course option and attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of not more than $100, so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under division (b) of this section.
      (3)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation,
or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in
division (b)(2) of this section that indicates that the offender was distracted
while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the officer shall do
both of the following:
         A.   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;

violation of any provision of this Traffic Code that is substantially similar
to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or required to
suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit for a
violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other penalties
authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for the period of time the
court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for the
violation of the provision of this Traffic Code shall not exceed the period of
suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of the
provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this Traffic Code is
substantially similar.

   414.02   THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the City, if they have a continuous
length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or highway or
portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-control
signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or highways.
For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or portion
thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus of the
street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which vehicular
traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to traffic on
the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the City may by
ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion thereof, not to be a
through highway and thereafter the affected residence district shall be
indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or more through
highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-control signal
is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more
entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic- control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
   414.03   TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start
to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians
facing a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not
enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(ORC 4511.13)
   414.04   SIGNAL TO CONTROL LANE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(ORC 4511.131)
   414.05   PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don't walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

or signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or hides from
view or interferes with the effectiveness of any traffic-control device or any
railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit, upon any highway any traffic sign or signal bearing
thereon any commercial advertising. This section does not prohibit either the
erection upon private property adjacent to highways of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for traffic-
control devices, or the erection upon private property of traffic-control
devices by the owner of real property in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.211 and
4511.432.
      (2)   Every prohibited sign, signal, marking, or device is a public
nuisance, and the authority having jurisdiction over the highway may remove the
same or cause it to be removed.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a

left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient
distance ahead to permit the overtaking and passing to be completely made
without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken. In every event, the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable, and
in the event the passing movement involves the use of a lane authorized for the

an auxiliary yellow line marked on the roadway pavement and placed parallel to
the normal centerline or marked lane line. When the auxiliary yellow line
appears on the left side of the driver’s lane of travel (to the right of the
normal centerline or marked lane line), no driver shall drive across the
auxiliary yellow line to overtake and pass another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction. When auxiliary yellow lines appear on both sides of the normal
centerline or marked lane line, drivers proceeding in either direction shall
not drive across such auxiliary yellow lines to overtake and pass another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction. No driver shall, at any other time,
drive across the auxiliary yellow line when it appears in the driver’s lane of
travel, except to make a lawfully permitted left- hand turn under the rules
governing such movement. “No Passing” signs may also be erected facing traffic
to indicate the beginning and end of each “no passing” zone.

   (b)   The Department of Transportation may determine those portions of any
State highway where overtaking and passing other traffic or driving to the left
of the center or center line of the roadway would be especially hazardous, and
may, by appropriate signs or markings on the highway, indicate the beginning
and end of such zones. When signs or markings are in place and clearly visible,
every operator of a vehicle shall obey the directions thereof, notwithstanding
the distances set out in Ohio R.C. 4511.30.

safety.
      (2)   Upon a roadway which is divided into three lanes and provides for
the two-way movement of traffic, a vehicle shall not be driven in the center
lane, except when overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway is
clearly visible and the center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance,
or when preparing for a left turn, or where the center lane is at the time
allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the direction the vehicle is
proceeding, and is posted with signs to give notice of such allocation.
      (3)   Official signs may be erected directing specified traffic to use a
designated lane or designating those lanes to be used by traffic moving in a
particular direction, regardless of the center of the roadway, or restricting
the use of a particular lane to only buses during certain hours or during all
hours, and drivers of vehicles shall obey the directions of such signs.

      (2)   The driver of any truck, or motor vehicle drawing another vehicle,
when traveling upon a roadway outside a business or residence district, shall
maintain a sufficient space, whenever conditions permit, between the vehicle
and another vehicle ahead so an overtaking motor vehicle may enter and occupy
the space without danger. This division (a)(2) does not prevent overtaking and
passing nor does it apply to any lane specially designated for use by trucks.
      (3)   Motor vehicles being driven upon any roadway outside of a business
or residence district in a caravan or motorcade shall maintain a sufficient
space between the vehicles so an overtaking vehicle may enter and occupy the
space without danger. This division shall not apply to funeral processions.

center line thereof and by passing to the right of the center line where it
enters the intersection, and, after entering the intersection, the left turn
shall be made so as to leave the intersection to the right of the center line
of the roadway being entered. Whenever practicable, the left turn shall be made
in that portion of the intersection to the left of the center of the
intersection.
      (3)   At any intersection where traffic is restricted to one direction on
one or more of the roadways, the driver of a vehicle intending to turn left at
any such intersection shall approach the intersection in the extreme left-hand
lane lawfully available to traffic moving in the direction of travel of the
vehicle, and, after entering the intersection, the left turn shall be made so
as to leave the intersection, as nearly as practicable, in the left hand lane
of the roadway being entered lawfully available to traffic moving in that lane.
   (b)   The Department of Transportation and local authorities may cause
markers, buttons, or signs to be placed within or adjacent to intersections,
and thereby require and direct that a different course from that specified in

   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, "emergency medical
technician-intermediate" and "emergency medical technician-paramedic" have the
same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. The form to be read to the person to be
tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall state that the
person may have an independent test performed at the person's expense. The
failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall
not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests
taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, "National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration" means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a

based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood

(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definitions. As used in this section:
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device” means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider.” Has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a)
or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person
if convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)
(c), (d), or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a)
or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
   "You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I. or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state O.V.I., and,
if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
   (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, in your blood, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense."
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person's initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged

person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent similar municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially

               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under this section,
and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test
results indicate is present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial

ordered unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.

violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under Ohio R.C. 2705.02
(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section,
Ohio R.C. 4507.35, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(1) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(2) of this section. The
person charged with a violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section
may offer evidence to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (4)   A.   Whoever violates division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court may impose upon the
offender a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in Ohio
R.C. 4510.02(A)(7).
         B.   1.   Except as provided in division (a)(4)B.2. or (a)(4)B.3. of
this section, the court, in addition to any other penalty that it imposes on
the offender and if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to one violation of this section, Ohio R.C. 4510.11,

offense for 30 days and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license plates for 30
days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
            2.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

vehicle’s license plates for 60 days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
            3.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

under this section unless the court is presented with current proof of
financial responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order
from the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar
shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration
of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (b)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section is guilty of
driving under suspension and shall be punished as provided in division (b)(3)A.
or division (b)(3)B. of this section.

section, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. The offender shall be

to one thousand dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding section
698.02(e)(1)C. and Ohio R.C. 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered
pursuant to section
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up
to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community
service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
         B.   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (b)
(1) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree, and the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial

permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver's
or commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

pursuant to section
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up
to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community
service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of
this section or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under division (c)(2) of this section, if

pleaded guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender's license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender's
driver license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02 (A)(7).

used to transport a child who otherwise would be required to be restrained
under this section. This section does not apply to a person operating a motor
vehicle who has an affidavit signed by a physician licensed to practice in this
state under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4731 or a chiropractor licensed to practice in
this state under R.C. Chapter 4734 that states that the child who otherwise

operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   (1)   Whoever violates division (a), (b), , (c), or (d) of this
section shall be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator
of a motor vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system,
booster seat or occupant restraining device as required by this section that
occurred at the same time, on the same day and at the same location is deemed
to be a single violation of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (j)(1)B. of this
section, the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not
less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy- five dollars
($75.00).
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a violation of division (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section or of a
State law or municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent any of those
divisions, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
      (2)   All fines imposed pursuant to division (j)(1) of this section shall
be forwarded to the State Treasurer for deposit in the Child Highway Safety
Fund created by Ohio R.C. 4511.81(I).

the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
thirty dollars ($30.00).

   (a)   (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum

Ohio R.C. 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   For regional trips at distances of 150 miles or less from a
facility stated on the application as the applicant’s point of origin.
            4.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         B.   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in Ohio R.C.
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

except those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as such by
appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is necessary to load

designated truck route within the City shall confine such deviation to that
required in order to accomplish the purpose of the departure. On County roads,
Council or other duly designated local authority shall establish reasonable
weight limits commensurate with the construction and material specifications
for such roads and the load resistance of such roads as determined by the
County Engineer. County roads shall be posted with signs indicating such weight
limits.
   (d)   Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets

Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the

may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the
Police Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant
shall pay the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00).
      (4)   Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating “no thru trucks -
gross weight 5 tons” or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit. Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections
408.01 and
408.02.

   Any junk motor vehicle or unlicensed motor vehicle is hereby declared to be
a public nuisance because it causes a deteriorating and blighting influence on
nearby properties and by reason of its depreciating the enjoyment and use of
the properties in the immediate vicinity to such an extent that it is harmful
to the public health, welfare and safety of the community in which such junk
motor vehicle or unlicensed motor vehicle is located, and such nuisance shall
be abated.

   452.05   WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper,
upon notification to the chief of such action and of the location of the place
of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, including an abandoned
junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief
of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However, when such
a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be ordered into
storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief or state highway patrol trooper shall allow
the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the removal
of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief or state
highway patrol trooper. If the chief or state highway patrol trooper determines
that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of time, the
chief or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the chief shall designate
the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
division (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle by
a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity of
the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the presentation, shall issue a salvage
certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief of
a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation of the reason for leaving
the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and Ohio R.C. 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property, or private property within the
City.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the City in disposing of such
abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the City from such
disposal.

defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or private
agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the chief

designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor

other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to division (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle

      (4)   As used in this section, “private residential property” means
private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than
three separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. The
phrase does not include any private property on which is located one or more
structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by two or more
persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in the structure
or structures.
   (b)   (1)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been

removal from the property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator
oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that the chief orders

include an entry for each such motor vehicle that identifies the motor
vehicle’s license number, make, model, and color, the location from which it
was removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the
person from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it
has been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under division (a)
(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both of
the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 or, if the vehicle

from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
      (4)   For purposes of division (d)(3) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (5)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
division (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for 30 days, the

misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 4513.60)
   (h)   Private Tow-away Zones.
      (1)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away
zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         A.   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;

If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow- away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the
sign.
         B.   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this division
(h) is taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with
all of the following:
            1.   It is located within 25 linear miles of the location of the
private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to a
place of storage within 25 linear miles.

as a private tow-away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this division (h). The vehicle owner and
the operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by

unlicensed tow truck operator.
         C.   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
      (3)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (h)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
      (4)   A.   Prior to towing a vehicle under division (h)(2) of this
section, a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many
photographs as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on
private property in violation of a private tow-away zone established under

recovered by the owner or lienholder or at least two years after the date on
which the vehicle was towed, whichever is earlier.
         B   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under division (h)
(2) of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more
than two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone,
unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two
hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is
not within the power of the towing service.
      (5)   A.   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under division
(h)(2) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of removing the

corporation shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed from private
property in the chief’s jurisdiction that is established as a private tow-away
zone of which the chief has received notice under this division (h). The record
shall include all information submitted by the towing service. The chief shall
provide any information in the record that pertains to a particular vehicle to
a person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner, operator, or lienholder of the vehicle and requests information
pertaining to the vehicle.
      (6)   A.   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance

service or storage facility from which the vehicle may be recovered shall cause
a search to be made of either of the following to ascertain the identity of the
owner and any lienholder of the vehicle:
            1.   The records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles;
            2.   The records of any vendor or vendors, approved by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles, that are capable of providing real-time access to
owner and lienholder information.
         B.   The towing service or storage facility may search the National
Motor Vehicle Title Information System in order to determine the state in which
the vehicle is titled. The entity that provides the record of the owner and any

   (a)   The parking ticket adopted in Section

   (b)   (1)   A law enforcement officer who issues a parking ticket for a
parking infraction shall complete the ticket and constructively serve the
parking ticket upon the owner of the vehicle by affixing the ticket to the
vehicle in a conspicuous place.
      (2)   Constructive service of a parking ticket upon an owner of a vehicle
by affixation as provided in division (b)(1), or by the procedure described in
division (d) of this section has the same force and effect, and potentially
subjects both parking infractions, if different, to the same fine and the same

hearing is requested, as if the parking ticket were personally served on both
the owner and operator of the vehicle at the time of the violation.

any true copy of it shall be considered a record kept in the ordinary course of
business of the City and of the law enforcement agency whose officer issued it,
and shall be prima facie evidence of the facts it contains.
   (d)   An operator of a vehicle who is not the owner of the vehicle, but who
operates it with the express or implied permission of the owner, is the agent
of the owner for purposes of the receipt of parking tickets served in
accordance with this section and personal service of a parking ticket upon the
operator in accordance with this section constitutes constructive service upon
the owner.
   (e)   When a parking ticket is issued for a parking infraction and is served
pursuant to this section, the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission
resulted in the parking infraction for which the ticket was issued and the
owner of the vehicle involved in the parking infraction, if different, are
jointly liable for the parking infraction and any fine, penalty, fees, and
costs arising out of the parking infraction. Any owner of a vehicle who pays
any fine, penalty, fee, and cost imposed for a parking infraction may recover
the amount paid from the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission resulted
in the infraction.
   (f)   No person upon whom a parking ticket charging a parking infraction is
personally or constructively served shall be arrested as a result of the
commission of the parking infraction.
   (g)   A parking infraction shall not be considered a criminal offense for
any purpose.

the City. The City Manager shall appoint a violations clerk and necessary
clerical employees.
   (c)   The fine, penalties, fees, and costs established for a parking
infraction shall be collected, retained, and disbursed by the violations clerk
if the parking infraction out of which the fine, penalties, fees, and costs
arose occurred within the jurisdiction of the Bureau. The violations clerk
shall issue blank tickets for parking infractions to law enforcement officers
for the City, and prescribe conditions for issuance and accountability. The
fine, penalties, fees, and costs collected by a violations clerk for a parking
infraction shall be disbursed by the clerk to the City.

(ORC 2901.01, 2921.01)
   606.02   CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22; Ord. 1785. Passed 1-14-74.)
   606.03   CLASSIFICATION OF OFFENSES.

   (b)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (a)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes

Municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this Municipality.
   (c)   (1)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its

         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two

      (2)   As used in this division:
         A.   The phrase “offense is directly related to the misconduct in
office of a public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of
Ohio R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A),

involving misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any
municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code
sections listed in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.
   (d)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is
determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if
the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be

      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation

match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time of
the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,
prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be commenced

      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

evidence of the accused’s purpose to avoid prosecution.

though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
   (l)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section that
took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03
committed on and after July 16, 2015, and apply to a violation of either of

violation was not barred under this section as it existed on July 16, 2015.
      (2)   The amendment to division (a)(2) of this section that took effect
on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of R.C. § 2903.01 or R.C. § 2903.02 if the
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4, 2023, and
applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.
(ORC 2901.13; Ord. 1785. Passed 1-14-74.)
   606.07   REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.” Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.” Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.” Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.” A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
   606.08   ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23; Ord. 1785. Passed 1-14-74.)
   606.09   PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24; Ord. 1785. Passed 1-14-74.)
   606.10   FALSIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall knowingly make a false statement, or knowingly swear
or affirm the truth of a false statement previously made, when any of the
following applies:
      (1)   The statement is made in any official proceeding.
      (2)   The statement is made with purpose to incriminate another.

administered by a governmental agency or paid out of a public treasury.
      (5)   The statement is made with purpose to secure the issuance by a
governmental agency of a license, permit, authorization, certificate,
registration, release, or provider agreement.

another person empowered to administer oaths.
      (7)   The statement is in writing on or in connection with a report or

offender, or to extend to or bestow upon the offender any other valuable
benefit or distinction, when the person to whom the statement is directed
relies upon it to his or her detriment.
      (9)   The statement is made with purpose to commit or facilitate the
commission of a theft offense.
      (10)   The statement is knowingly made to a probate court in connection
with any action, proceeding, or other matter within its jurisdiction, either
orally or in a written document, including, but not limited to, an application,
petition, complaint, or other pleading, or an inventory, account, or report.
      (11)   The statement is made on an account, form, record, stamp, label or
other writing that is required by law.
      (12)   The statement is made in connection with the purchase of a

      (13)   The statement is made in a document or instrument of writing that

sheriff pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2923.125 in order to obtain or renew a concealed
handgun license or is made in an affidavit submitted to a county sheriff to
obtain a concealed handgun license on a temporary emergency basis under Ohio
R.C. 2923.1213.
      (15)   The statement is required under Ohio R.C. 5743.71 in connection

fictitious or altered identification card, or any other document that contains
false information about the purchaser’s identity.
   (c)   No person, in an attempt to obtain a concealed handgun license under

the death of a person shall fail to report the death immediately to a physician
or advanced practice registered nurse whom the person knows to be treating the
deceased for a condition from which death at such time would not be unexpected,
or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or

of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a

attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a

   (k)   Hearing.
      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, Ohio R.C 955.11
(D) and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and
the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog,
and section
618.20 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and
“vicious dog” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 955.11.

alternative, may order the dangerous dog to be humanely destroyed by a licensed
veterinarian, the county dog warden, or the county humane society at the
owner’s expense. With respect to a violation of division (d) of this section
that involves a dangerous dog, until the court makes a final determination and

specifies that Ohio R.C. 955.11(D) and divisions (e) to (j) of this section
apply with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as
if the dog were a dangerous dog and that Section
618.20 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog. As part
of the order, the court shall order the offender to obtain the liability

give written notice of the confinement to the owner of the dog. If the county
dog warden is unable to give the notice to the owner of the dog, the county dog

basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,

analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused’s analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s analyst with the sample
portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial. If the

and given to the accused’s analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused’s attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

she shall attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of initial conference and
persuasion with all interested parties and such representatives as the parties
may choose to assist them. Conciliation conferences shall be informal and

writing.

grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he or she shall so
inform the Board and the Board may in its discretion dismiss such complaint or
order such further investigation as may be necessary, provided that the Board
shall not dismiss such complaint without first affording either party an
opportunity to appear before the Board.
   (f)   If the Secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a violation
of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a complaint is not
susceptible of conciliation, he or she shall so notify the Board and the Board
shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a violation of
this chapter has been committed. The Board shall serve upon the respondent a
written statement of charges and a summons and shall serve upon all interested
parties a notice of the time and place of the hearing. The respondent or his or
her authorized counsel may file and amend such statements with the Board prior
to the hearing date as he or she deems necessary in support of his or her
position. The hearing shall be open to the public. The hearing shall be held
not less than fifteen calendar days nor more than thirty calendar days after
service of the statement of charges and summons. The summons so issued must be
signed by two members of the Board and the issuance of such summons shall
require the attendance of named persons and the production of relevant
documents and records. The failure to comply with a summons shall constitute a
violation of this chapter. The interested parties may, at their option, appear
before the Board in person or by a duly authorized representative and may have
the assistance of an attorney. The parties may present testimony and evidence,
and the right to cross examine witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony and
evidence shall be given under oath or by affirmation. The Secretary shall keep
a full record of the hearing, which record shall be public and open to
inspection by any person, and upon request by any principal party to the
proceeding, the Board shall furnish such party a copy of the hearing record, at
such cost as the Board deems appropriate.
   (g)   (1)   If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board determines, upon
the preponderance of the evidence, that the person complained against has
violated this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Municipal
Attorney in executive session, state its findings to and cause the Municipal
Attorney to prepare and issue an order under Board directive requiring the
person complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to
take such affirmative action as will effectuate the purpose of this chapter,
with notice that if the Board, upon investigation by the Secretary, determines
that the person complained against has not, after fifteen calendar days
following service of the Board's order, complied with the order, the Board will
recertify the matter to the Municipal Attorney for enforcement.
      (2)   The Municipal Attorney shall seek compliance by appropriate civil
action brought in the name of the Board before a court of competent
jurisdiction.
   (h)   If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board determines, upon the
preponderance of the evidence of the record, that the person complained against
has not violated this chapter, the Board shall so state and publish its
findings and issue its orders dismissing the complaint.

or a mentally or physically disabled child under 21 years of age, shall create
a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child by violating a duty of
care, protection, or support. It is not a violation of a duty of care,
protection, or support under this division when the parent, guardian,
custodian, or person having custody or control of a child treats the physical
or mental illness or disability of the child by spiritual means through prayer
alone, in accordance with the tenets of a recognized religious body.
   (b)   No person shall do any of the following to a child under 18 years of

      (3)   Administer corporal punishment or other physical disciplinary
measure, or physically restrain the child in a cruel manner or for a prolonged
period, which punishment, discipline or restraint is excessive under the
circumstances and creates a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the
child.
      (4)   Repeatedly administer unwarranted disciplinary measures to a child
when there is a substantial risk that such conduct, if continued, will
seriously impair or retard the child’s mental health or development.

allow the child to act, model, or in any other way participate in, or be
photographed for, the production, presentation, dissemination, or advertisement
of any material or performance that the offender knows or reasonably should
know is obscene, is sexually oriented matter, or is nudity-oriented matter.
      (6)   Allow the child to be on the same parcel of real property and
within 100 feet of, or, in the case of more than one housing unit on the same
parcel of real property, in the same housing unit and within 100 feet of, any

it existed prior to March 23, 2000, or Ohio R.C. 2903.04, in a case in which
the offender was subject to the sanctions described in division (D) of that
section, endangering children in violation of division (c) of this section is a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate State law.
         D.   In addition to any term of imprisonment, fine, or other sentence,
penalty or sanction it imposes upon the offender pursuant to divisions (e)

penalty or sanction imposed upon the offender pursuant to division (e)(3)A.,
B., C. or D. of this section or pursuant to any other provision of law for the
violation of division (c) of this section, if as a part of the same trial or

charge charging the violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A), or a substantially
similar municipal ordinance, that was the basis of the charge of the violation

division (c) of this section but the person is not also convicted of and does
not also plead guilty to a separate charge of violating Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A),

the court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term as provided in
R.C. § 2929.24(F).

operating privilege of the offender from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02
(A)(4).
      (2)   If the offender shows good cause why the court should not suspend
one of the types of licenses, permits or privileges specified in division (d)
(1) of this section or deny the issuance of one of the temporary instruction
permits specified in division (d)(1) of this section, the court in its
discretion may choose not to impose the suspension, revocation or denial
required in division (d)(1) of this section, but the court, in its discretion,
instead may require the offender to perform community service for a number of
hours determined by the court.
   (e)   As used in this section, “object that is indistinguishable from a
firearm” means an object made, constructed or altered so that, to a reasonable
person without specialized training in firearms, the object appears to be a
firearm.

   698.01   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Dangerous offender” means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   “Repeat offender” means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or
more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent felony drug
abuse offense;
      (5)   Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or
degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offenses, or minor
misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
(ORC 2935.36(E))
   698.02   PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially similar to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially similar to a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
666.99 or
698.03 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court's consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court's
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender's jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C.  307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and 698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail
term is required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other
than a minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. 307.932. In all
other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including
but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, and other contagious diseases. The
person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who
refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, or another contagious
disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         C.   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor of
the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or fourth
degree;
         D.   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         E.   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         F.   A term of basic probation supervision;
         G.   A term of monitored time;
         H.   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         I.   A curfew term;
         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender's privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender's motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator's license, or any other related sanction;
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state or political subdivision may
do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
   698.03   IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or 698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that
imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the
offender any sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
   698.04   ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand
dollars ($3,000.00);
      (4)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two thousand
dollars ($2,000.00);
      (5)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
   698.05   MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a
prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(ORC 2929.41)
   698.06   MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section
698.06 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating and revision of this Code of
Ordinances because substantially identical State law (Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was
repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
   698.07   SUSPENSION OF DRIVER’S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
similar to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially similar.

   849.01   PURPOSE, INTENT AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually-
oriented businesses to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare
of the citizens of the Municipality and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations regarding sexually-oriented businesses within the Municipality. The
provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a
limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials,
including sexually-oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent or
effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually-
oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the
distributors and exhibitors of sexually-oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone
or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
   (b)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on the community presented in reports made available to the
Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of Municipality of Renton v.
Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres,
426 U.S. 50 (1976), FW/PBS, Inc. v. Municipality of Dallas, 493 U.S. 295
(1990); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 509 U.S. 560 (1991), Municipality of Erie
v. Pap's A. M., 120 5. Ct. 1382 (2000), and on studies in other communities
including, but not limited to: Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, the Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually-oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners
of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
      (2)   Certain employees of sexually-oriented businesses, defined in this
chapter as adult theaters and adult cabarets, engage in higher incidence of
certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments.
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually-oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
      (4)   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which
creates unhealthy conditions.
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually- oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually-oriented businesses.
      (6)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually-oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HW-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella
infections.
      (7)   Since 1981 there has been an increasing cumulative number of
reported cases of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HW) in the United States: 600 in 1982; 2,200 in 1983;
4,600 in 1984; 8,555 in 1985, and 253,448 through December 31, 1992.
      (8)   The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982,
and 45,200 through November, 1990.
      (9)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being
reported in 1990.
      (10)   In his report of October 22, 1986, the Surgeon General of the
United States has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may
be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      (11)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
      (12)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually-oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
      (13)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually-oriented businesses where persons view "adult"
oriented films.
      (14)   The findings noted in divisions (1) through (13) of this section
raise substantial governmental concerns.
      (15)   Sexually-oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (16)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually-oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually, oriented business
is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its
patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the Municipality. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the sexually-oriented business, fully in possession and control of
the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (17)   Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
      (18)   Requiring licensees of sexually-oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments.
      (19)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually-
oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
      (20)   In the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases, it is
desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent, or who
are likely to be witnesses to such conduct.
      (21)   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been
convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the
applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
      (22)   The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses
for a period of years serves as a deterrent to, and prevents conduct which
leads to, the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
      (23)   The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of
the Municipality will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

application. In the event that an application for renewal of a provisional
license is denied and the applicant seeks judicial review of that denial, the

following:
      (1)   On all gross earnings, salaries, wages, bonuses, sick pay, subpay,
commissions, deferred compensation, pension plans and other compensation earned
on and after February 1, 1973, by resident individuals of the City;
      (2)   On all gross earnings, salaries, wages, bonuses, sick pay, subpay,

services performed or rendered in the City;
      (3)   On the net profits attributable to the City earned on and after

business or other activities conducted in the City;
      (4)   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits earned

Internal Revenue Code shall be allowed against gambling and sports winnings.
   (b)   The portion of the net profits attributable to the City of a taxpayer
conducting a business, profession or other activity, both within and without

and in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by Council pursuant to

   880.03   DETERMINATION OF INCOME SUBJECT TO TAX.
   (a)   In the taxation of income which is subject to taxation under this
chapter, if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or
profession both within and without the boundaries of the City disclose with
reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit is attributable to that part
of the business or profession conducted within the boundaries of the City, then
only such portion shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the City for
purposes of income taxation. In the absence of such records, net profit from a
business or profession conducted both within and without the boundaries of the
City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the City for purposes of
income taxation in the same proportion as the average ratio of:
      (1)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
City during the taxable period, to the average net book value of all of the
real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used in
this paragraph, "real property" includes property rented or leased by the
taxpayer. The value for such property shall be determined by multiplying the
annual rental thereon by eight.
      (2)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the City, to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed; and
      (3)   The gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made
and services performed during the taxable period in the City, to gross receipts
of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
so as to produce such result.
   (b)   As used in this section, "sales made in the City" means:
      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the City, regardless of where title passes, if shipped or delivered from a
stock of goods within the City;
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the City, regardless of where title passes, even though transported from a
point outside the City, if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion; and
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the City to purchasers outside the City, regardless of where title
passes, if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in
the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
(Ord. 39-92. Passed 12-21-92.)
   880.04   EFFECTIVE DATE.
   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be levied, collected and paid with
respect to salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned on and
after February 1, 1973, and with respect to the net profit of businesses,
professions and other activities earned on and after February 1, 1973,
provided, however, that where the fiscal year of the business, profession or
other activity differs from the calendar year, the tax shall be applied to that
part of the net profit for the fiscal year as is earned on and after February
1, 1973, to the close of the taxpayer's fiscal year. Thereafter, the taxpayer
shall report on its fiscal year basis.

(Ord. 39-92. Passed 12-21-92.)

   The failure of an employer, taxpayer or other person to receive or procure a
return, declaration or other required form shall not excuse him or her from
making any information return or declaration, from filing such form or from

(Ord. 39-92. Passed 12-21-92.)
   880.16   EFFECTIVE PERIOD.
   This chapter shall remain in effect until it is amended or repealed by
Council.
(Ord. 39-92. Passed 12-21-92.)
   880.17   ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Twelve-day occasional entry rule.
      (1)   A nonresident individual who works in the City 12 or fewer days per
year shall be considered an occasional entrant, and shall not be subject to
municipal income tax for those 12 days. For purposes of the 12-day calculation,
any portion of a day worked in the City shall be counted as one day worked in
the City.
      (2)   Beginning with the thirteenth day, the employer of said individual
shall begin withholding City income tax from remuneration paid by the employer
to the individual, and shall remit the withheld income tax to the City in
accordance with this chapter. Since the individual can no longer be considered
to have been an occasional entrant, the employer is further required to remit
taxes on income earned in the City by the individual for the first 12 days.
      (3)   If the individual is self-employed, it shall be the responsibility
of the individual to remit the appropriate income tax to the City.
      (4)   The 12-day occasional entry rule does not apply to entertainers or
professional athletes, their employees or individuals who perform services on
their behalf, or to promoters and booking agents of such entertainment events
and sporting events.
      (5)   Income tax withheld by a nonresident employer and paid to the City
as a result of the employer being subject to the $150 de minimus provision
cannot be refunded to an individual under the 12-day occasional entry
provision.
   (b)   $150 de minimus rule.
      (1)   If not currently required to withhold City income tax, then a
nonresident employer, agent of such employer, or other payer not situated in
the City shall not further be required to withhold City income tax from
remuneration paid to employees of the employer until the collective tax
liability of the employees initially exceeds $150.
      (2)   Independent contractors of a nonresident employer shall be deemed
employees for work performed in the City on behalf of the employer, and are
subject to the collective tax liability provision as if they were employees,
and are not excluded from taxation.
      (3)   When the collective tax liability exceeds $150, the employer is
required to begin withholding the appropriate income tax for the City on behalf
of all the employees performing work in the City. The withheld income tax shall
be remitted to the City in accordance with this chapter. After exceeding the
$150 de minimus amount, the employer shall continue to have no responsibility
for remitting any portion of the initial $150 liability that was not withheld.
      (4)   Once the collective tax liability has exceeded the $150, the
employer must withhold income tax for the City (i.e., for work performed in the
City) for the remainder of that calendar year and for subsequent years, even if
the liability in subsequent years does not exceed $150. However, if the tax
liability for each of the three consecutive years (subsequent to that year in
which the employer became liable for withholding the income tax) does not
exceed $150, the employer will be considered as not having performed work in
the City in regard to further tax liability, and will again be subject to
division (a) of this section.
   (c)   Forms. All income tax returns, reports or other documents required
under this chapter may be filed on the forms promulgated by the City or upon
generic forms of such returns, reports or documents. The City shall accept
generic forms, if the generic forms, once completed and filed, contain all of
the information required to be submitted with the City's prescribed returns,
reports or documents, and if the taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic
form otherwise complies with this City's rules or ordinances governing the
filing of returns, reports or documents.
   (d)   Extensions. The Finance Director shall extend the time for filing of
the annual City tax return upon the filing of a copy of the taxpayer's request
for a federal extension. No extension may exceed six months, or one month
beyond the extension requested of or granted by the Internal Revenue Service
for filing of the federal income tax return, and will not be approved for a
period less than the federal extension request. The request for extension shall
be filed no later than the last day for filing the municipal income tax return
as prescribed by ordinance or rule of the City income tax. The City may require
a tentative return accompanied by payment of the amount shown to be due thereon
by the date the return is normally due. The City may deny a taxpayer's request
for extension only if the taxpayer fails to timely file the request, fails to
file a copy of the request for the federal extension, owes the City any
delinquent income tax or any penalty, interest, assessment or other charge for
the late payment or nonpayment of income tax, or has failed to file any
required income tax return, report, or other related document for a prior tax
period. The granting of an extension for filing this City's income tax return
does not extend the last date for paying the tax without penalty unless the
City grants an extension of the date.
(Ord. 6-01. Passed 3-12-01.)
   880.99   PENALTY.
   (a)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this
chapter, for no penalty is otherwise provided, is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the first degree and shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000)
or imprisoned not more than six months, or both, for each offense. A separate
offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a violation or
noncompliance occurs or continues.
   (b)   In addition to the penalty provided in division (a) of this section,
whoever violates Section
880.06(e) shall be immediately dismissed from the service of the City. Each
disclosure shall constitute a separate offense.

chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the
Ohio Revised Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term
used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a
comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of
the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)   The singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall include
the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   (c)   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   “Adjusted federal taxable income,” for a person required to file as
a C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C
corporation under division (c)(24)E. of this section, means a C corporation's
federal taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as
determined under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
         A.   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal
taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income.
         B.   Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (c)(1)A. of this section, but excluding that portion of
intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition
of property described in Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         C.   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
         D.   1.   Except as provided in (c)(l)D.2. of this section, deduct
income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the income and
gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of an asset
described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
            2.   Division (c)(l)D.1. of this section does not apply to the

the computation of federal taxable income;
         F.   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated

computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under R.C. § 4313.02;

this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable
year beginning on or after January 1, 2017. The amount of such net operating
loss shall be deducted from net profit that is reduced by exempt income to the
extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable income to zero, with any remaining
unused portion of the net operating loss carried forward to not more than five
consecutive taxable years following the taxable year in which the loss was
incurred, but in no case for more years than necessary for the deduction to be
fully utilized.

of this section to offset qualifying wages.
            3.   a.   For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, or

            5.   Nothing in division (c)(l)H.3.a. of this section precludes a
person from carrying forward, use with respect to any return filed for a
taxable year beginning after 2018, any amount of net operating loss that was
not fully utilized by operation of division (c)(l)H.3.a. of this section. To
the extent that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully utilized in

is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable year
beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in division
(c)(l)H.3.a. of this section shall apply to the amount carried forward.
         I.   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or

the group's federal taxable income in accordance with Section
882.05(d)(5)C.2.
         J.   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or

entity that has made an election described in division (c)(48)B. of this
section, is not a publicly traded partnership that has made the election
described in division (c)(24)E. of this section, and is not an individual, the
taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal taxable income under this section as if
the taxpayer were a C corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar
amounts paid or accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible
expense unless such payments are in consideration for the use of capital and
treated as payment of interest under Section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code
or United States treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified
self-employed retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer,
amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts
paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.
            2.   Nothing in division (c)(1) of this section shall be construed
as allowing the taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be
construed as allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for
purposes of federal self-employment tax.

that commences the person's time limitation for making an appeal to the Board
of Tax Review pursuant to Section

or a tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to
all or a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment
method as described in division F.2. of this section. However, a tax
administrator shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a
manner that it would require a taxpayer to tile a net profit return with a
municipal corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's
qualifying remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.

division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages

Municipality of East Palestine, Ohio or if the individual taxpayer that
receives the net profit is a resident of Municipality of East Palestine, Ohio.

separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to Municipality of East
Palestine, Ohio, if applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the
agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
located in Municipality of East Palestine, Ohio to the commissions received
from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable
year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of Municipality of East
Palestine, Ohio shall report the individual's net profit from all real estate
activity on the individual's annual tax return for Municipality of East
Palestine, Ohio. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the individual
paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the extent that
such a credit is allowed under Municipality of East Palestine, Ohio's income
tax ordinance.
      (7)   When calculating the ratios described in division (d)(l) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (d)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the

Municipality of East Palestine. Except for qualifying wages for which
withholding is not required under Section
882.03 or division (a)(2)D. or (a)(2)F. of this section, the tax shall be
withheld at the rate, specified in Section
882.01 of this chapter, of one percent (1.00%). An employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying

taxes deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and
withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer according to the following
schedule:
            1.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or

behalf of the Municipality of East Palestine in the preceding calendar year
exceeded two thousand three hundred ninety nine dollars ($2,399.00), or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of Municipality of East Palestine in any month of the
preceding calendar quarter exceeded two hundred dollars ($200.00). Payment
under division (a)(2)A.1. of this section shall be made so that the payment is
received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last
day of each month for which the tax was withheld.

to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Municipality of East
Palestine. The payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division
does not affect an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any
return as required under this section.
         C.   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the Municipality of East
Palestine as the return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income
subject to the tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the
employee's employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.

individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of
either the corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued
or of such corporation's successor entity.
         E.   1.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
            2.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the Municipality of East Palestine the tax withheld relieves
the employee from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax
withheld.
         F.   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Municipality of East Palestine income tax or income tax withholding requirement
to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at
the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
         G.   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality of East Palestine until such
time as the withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
         H.   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator

employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with
the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
         J.   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Municipality
of East Palestine income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's
employees and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the
tips and gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this
division, a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or
gratuity is paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to
the employee, or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit
card, or other electronic means.

computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
         C.   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or

of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net
profit sitused to Municipality of East Palestine, Ohio. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         D.   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
            1.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
882.05(d)(1) through (d)(8), exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts
of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net
profit sitused to Municipality of East Palestine, Ohio;

      (2)   As used in this section, “qualifying deferral period” means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
882.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth day
after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is
either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
882.09.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality of East Palestine
does not prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
882.09, with interest on that amount as provided by Section
882.09(e).
   (e)   No civil action to recover the Municipality of East Palestine income
tax or related penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the
following time periods:

      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 19-2015. Passed 10-26-15; Ord. 30-2017. Passed 12-28-17.)
   882.13   AUDITS.
   (a)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
      (1)   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the
taxpayer's attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
      (2)   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest
(Ord. 19-2015. Passed 10-26-15; Ord. 30-2017. Passed 12-28-17.)
   882.14   SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Last known address” means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   “Undeliverable address” means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056 is not able to
deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-
delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (b)   Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. § 5703.056. With
the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator
may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this
section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056. If
the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within sixty days after the assessment's
postmark.
         B.   Once the Tax Administrator or other Municipality of East
Palestine official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the
person to whom the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of
that assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within
sixty days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the
Tax Administrator under division (c)(1)A. of this section is prima facie
evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)   A.   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by
certified mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address,
the Tax Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The
assessment shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and
include the following statement: “This assessment is deemed to be served on the
addressee under applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was
mailed by the Tax Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods
within which an appeal may be filed apply from and after that date.”
         B.   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable
address, the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery
of the assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
         C.   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)
(1)A. of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent (20%), as determined by
voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Municipality
of East Palestine official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing
in this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering
into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an
appeal with the local board of tax review.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the rules and regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 19-2015. Passed 10-26-15; Ord. 30-2017. Passed 12-28-17.)

   (a)   As used in this section, “claim” means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality of East Palestine that arises pursuant to the Municipality
of East Palestine's income tax imposed in accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
Municipal Corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 19-2015. Passed 10-26-15; Ord. 30-2017. Passed 12-28-17.)
   882.16   TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Municipality
of East Palestine as authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a
designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the Tax Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality of East Palestine from
publishing or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose
information with respect to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 19-2015. Passed 10-26-15; Ord. 30-2017. Passed 12-28-17.)
   882.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Municipality of East Palestine
ordinance or state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly
procure, counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report,
return, schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or
amend, or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or
amendment of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality of East
Palestine or the Tax Administrator.

the Municipality of East Palestine to which the return is to be filed or the

      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;

for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return

such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the Municipality of East Palestine or for the withholding of such
tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail

requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or

882.99 for a violation of Section
882.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

   (b)   The Community Reinvestment Area of the City is hereby established,
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3735.66, to include the entire corporation limits of the

   All properties within the designated Community Reinvestment Area are

assessed valuation resulting from improvements to commercial and industrial
real property and the term of those exemptions shall be negotiated on a case-
by-case basis in advance of construction or remodeling occurring according to
the rules outlined in Ohio R.C. 3765.67. The results of the negotiation as
approved by Council will be set in writing in a Community Reinvestment Area
Agreement as outlined in Ohio R.C. 3735.671. All structures containing three or
more dwelling units will be considered "commercial" and will be required to
following the stipulations for a commercial agreement.
      (1)   Up to 12 years for existing commercial and industrial facilities
shall be negotiated on a case-by-case basis in advance of construction or
remodeling occurring.
      (2)   Up to 15 years for new commercial or industrial facilities shall be
negotiated on a case-by-case basis in advance of construction occurring.
   (b)   Residential Property.
      (1)   For residential property, a 100 percent tax exemption on the

Ohio R.C. 3735.67 shall be granted upon proper application by the property
owner and certification thereof by the designated Housing Officer for the
following periods:

thousand dollars ($5,000.00), as described in Ohio R.C. 3735.67.

housing units.

later than six months after construction completion; however, the owner of a
dwelling constructed in a community reinvestment area may file an application
for an exemption after the year the construction first became subject to
taxation. The application shall be processed in accordance with the procedures
prescribed under this section and shall be granted if the construction that is
the subject of the application otherwise meets the requirements for an
exemption under this section. If approved, the exemption sought in the
application first applies in the year the application is filed. An exemption
approved pursuant to this division continues only for those years remaining in
the period described in this section. No exemption may be claimed for any year
in that period that precedes the year in which the application is filed.
      (3)   If remodeling qualifies for an exemption during the period of the
exemption, the exempted percentage of the dollar amount of the increase in
market value of the structure shall be exempt from real property taxation.
      (4)   If new construction qualifies for an exemption during the period of
the exemption, the exempted percentage of the structure shall not be considered
to be an improvement on the land on which it is located for the purpose of real
property taxation.

pea gravel, from the bottom of the opening to one foot above any utility, water
or sewer lines. Backfill with compacted limestone, from the layer of pea gravel
to approximately eight inches below final grade. Limestone sand is not

a number of cross trenches are laid in close proximity to one another, or where
the equipment used may cause such damage, he or she may require a negotiated
contribution from the permittee for the resurfacing in the place of patching
such street if the total area of the proposed patch or probably damaged area
exceeds 25% of the total pavement surfacing between curb faces or between
concrete gutter edges in any block. Such negotiations shall be carried on and
contributions agreed upon prior to issuance of a permit.
   (e)   After excavation is commenced, the work of making and backfilling the
same shall be prosecuted with due diligence.

municipal specifications. Prior to the issuance of a certificate, the Manager
shall make a final inspection of the restoration to determine whether municipal
specifications have been adhered to.
   (i)   If any settlement in a restored area occurs within a period of one
year from date of completion of the permanent restoration, any expense incurred
by the municipality in correcting such settlement shall be paid by the
permittee or recovered from his or her bond, unless the permittee submits proof
satisfactory to the Manager that the settlement was not due to defective
backfilling.

requirement insofar as it pertains to a public utility company if such company
files with the municipality its corporate bond in a form satisfactory to the
Municipal Attorney, conditioned upon the payment to the municipality of all
costs which would otherwise be covered by and paid out of such a deposit. In
the event any public utility company elects to file such a bond, the

(Ord. 17-2016. Passed 10-10-16.)
   1020.16   FORM OF DEPOSIT.

institute an action to recover the same in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Until such deficiency is paid in full, no additional permits shall be issued to
such permittee.

opening or excavation per calendar year, such public utility or municipal
authority may post one deposit in an amount and form as provided above for the
calendar year or part thereof to cover the cost of any and all work.

charges periodically to reflect any increase or decrease in costs used to
establish such charges. The schedule of charges shall be open to public
inspection in the office of the Manager upon demand.

governing body shall decide the amount due the municipality.
(Ord. 17-2016. Passed 10-10-16.)

refund to the permittee his or her deposit less all costs incurred by the
municipality in connection with such permit. In no event shall the permit fee
be refunded.
(Ord. 17-2016. Passed 10-10-16.)
   1020.22   MAINTENANCE BOND REQUIREMENTS.
   Each applicant, upon the receipt of a permit, shall provide the municipality
with an acceptable corporate surety bond to guarantee faithful performance of
the work authorized by a permit granted pursuant to this chapter. The amount of
the bond shall be 100% of the estimated cost of restoring the street opening.
The term of the bond shall begin upon the date of posting thereof and shall
terminate upon the receipt by the permittee of a certificate of final
inspection from the Manager. If the permittee anticipates requesting more than
one permit per year as required by this chapter, he or she may furnish one
continuing corporate surety bond in such amount as the Manager deems necessary
to guarantee faithful performance. The amount of such bond shall be in relation
to the cost of restoring pavement cuts to be made by the permittee throughout
the year. The municipality may elect to waive the requirement insofar as it
pertains to a public utility company if such company files with the
municipality its corporate bond in a form satisfactory to the Municipal
Attorney, conditioned upon compliance with the provisions of this chapter.

indemnify the municipality for the cost of doing the work as set forth in the
notice.
(Ord. 17-2016. Passed 10-10-16.)
   1020.25   INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   Each applicant, upon the receipt of a permit, shall provide the municipality
with an acceptable certificate of insurance indicating that he or she is
insured against claims for damages for personal injury as well as against
claims for property damage which may arise from or out of the performance of
the work, whether such performance be by himself or herself, his or her
subcontractor or anyone directly or indirectly employed by him or her. Such
insurance shall cover collapse, explosive hazards and underground work by
equipment on the street, and shall include protection against liability arising
from completed operations. The amount of the insurance shall be prescribed by
the Village Manager in accordance with the nature of the risk involved.
However, the liability insurance for bodily injury in effect shall not be less
than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) for each person, and three
hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) for each accident, and for property
damages not less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), with an aggregate of

has adequate provision for self insurance, in accordance with the requirements
of this chapter. Public utilities and authorities may submit annually such
evidence of insurance coverage in lieu of individual submissions for each
permit.

      (2)   The utility service provider shall apply to the City Manager for a
certificate of registration or the renewal of a certificate of registration.
The City Manager shall determine the form of the application. An application
shall include the following information and fee:
         A.   Detailed identification information about the utility service
provider; a copy of the current incorporation certificate of the applicant, if
applicable; both regular and emergency contact information for the utility
service provider; a brief description of each utility service provided or
proposed to be provided; a copy of each approval required by law, by any
applicable authority, to provide any utility service described in the
application; evidence of reasonable insurance coverage by the utility service
provider; and any other relevant information the City Manager deems necessary
to determine the fitness of the utility service provider.
         B.   If requested by the City Manager or the applicant, the applicant
utility service provider and the City must meet to coordinate future plans for
the public right-of-way between the utility service provider and the City.
         C.   An application fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) shall be
paid to the City at the time an application for a certificate of registration
is filed with the City. No part of an application fee is returnable to the
applicant.
   (b)   Decision by Council. Unless the applicant agrees to an extension of
the maximum decision time, the City shall have a maximum time period of ninety
consecutive calendar days from the date a complete application for a
certificate of registration by a utility service provider is received by the
City to make a decision on the application. Unless the applicant agrees to an
extension of the maximum decision time, failure of the City to make a decision
on an application for a certificate of registration shall be considered the
same as an approval of the application by the City.
   (c)   Criteria for Issuance. In deciding whether to issue a certificate of
registration, the City Manager shall consider: whether the issuance of the
certificate of registration will contribute to the health, safety, and welfare
of the City and its citizens; whether the issuance of the certificate of
registration will be consistent with this chapter; whether the applicant has
submitted a complete application and has secured all certificates and other
authorizations required by law in order to construct and operate a system in
the manner proposed by the applicant; whether the applicant is delinquent on
any taxes or other obligations owed to the City, to Columbiana County, or to
the State of Ohio; whether the applicant has the requisite financial,
managerial, and technical ability to fulfill all the obligations under this
chapter and the issuance of a certificate of registration; and any other
applicable law.
   (d)   Denial of Application. The City Manager shall have the right to deny
an application for a certificate of registration for adequate cause. If
requested in writing by the applicant, the City Manager must provide to the
applicant in written form specific factual findings in support of the decision
by the City Manager to deny the application for a certificate of registration.
Any decision by the City Manager to deny an application for a certificate of
registration is appealable by the applicant to the City Council in the manner
set forth in Section
1032.25.
   (e)   Expiration of Certificate. Unless terminated by the City at an earlier
date, a certificate of registration shall expire one year from the date of
issuance by the City.
   (f)   Responsibilities of Provider.
      (1)   When required by these Codified Ordinances, a utility service
provider with a valid certificate of registration must obtain a revocable
street privilege permit.
      (2)   The provider must keep all the information required in the
application by the City current.
      (3)   When requested by the City, a public or private utility service
provider, with a utility system element located or proposed to be located in a
public right-of-way in the City, must meet with the City to coordinate future
plans for the public right-of-way between the utility service provider and the
City.
      (4)   A utility service provider with any utility system element located
or proposed to be located in a right-of-way in the City must provide the City
with up-to-date accurate plans in sufficient detail and in a format acceptable
to the City showing the location of all elements of the utility system located
in the right-of-way in the City.
      (5)   In addition to a certificate of registration, providers shall
obtain any and all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses
necessary for the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate
Federal, State and local authorities and, upon the City's reasonable request,
shall provide copies of such documents to the City.
      (6)   A certificate of registration issued pursuant to this chapter shall
not entitle a provider to use, alter, convert to, or interfere with, the
facilities, easements, poles, conduits, lines, pipelines, wires, fiber, cable,
or any other real or personal property of any kind whatsoever under the
management or control of the City.
   (g)   Limitations on Rights of Provider. A certificate of registration shall
not convey equitable or legal title in the rights-of-way. A certificate of
registration is only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy rights-of-way in
the City for the limited purpose and for the limited period stated in the
certificate of registration and in accordance with this chapter and any
associated permit. For those providers with a valid gas or electric franchise,
the provisions of a certificate of registration shall be deemed regulatory in
nature and shall not be interpreted to limit the right to occupy the rights-of-
way which may have been granted by such franchise. The rights to occupy the
right-of-way itself may not be subdivided or subleased, provided, however, that
two or more providers may collocate facilities in the same area of the rights-
of-way so long as each such provider complies with the provisions of this
chapter. A certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from
obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating
its facilities on facilities of others, including the City's facilities. A
certificate of registration does not prevent a provider from leasing space in
or on the provider's system, so long as the sharing of facilities does not
cause a violation of law, including the provisions of this chapter. A
certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from complying with any
provisions of this chapter and other applicable laws.
   (h)   Relocation of Equipment.
      (1)   A provider must promptly and at its own expense, with due regard
for seasonal working conditions, permanently remove and relocate its equipment
and facilities in the right-of-way whenever the City Manager requests such
removal and relocation, and shall restore the right-of-way to the same
condition it was in prior to said removal or relocation. The City Manager may
make such request to prevent interference by the company's equipment or
facilities with:
         A.   A present or future City use of the right-of-way;
         B.   A public improvement undertaken by the City;
         C.   An economic development project in which the City has an interest
or investment;
         D.   When the public health, safety and welfare require it; or
         E.   When necessary to prevent interference with the safety and
convenience of ordinary travel over the right-of-way.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, no person shall be required to
remove or relocate its equipment from any right-of-way which has been vacated
in favor of a non-governmental entity unless and until the reasonable costs
thereof are first paid to the person therefor.
   (i)   Location of Equipment Prior to Excavation. Before the start date of
any right- of-way excavation, each provider who has equipment in the area to be
excavated shall mark the horizontal and approximate vertical placement of all
said equipment. Any provider whose equipment is less that 20 inches below a
concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and work closely with the excavation
contractor to establish the exact location of its equipment and the best
procedure for excavation.
   (j)   Work by City in Right-of-Way; Removal of Provider's Equipment; Damage
to Equipment in Right-of-Way; Costs.
      (1)   When the City does or causes to be done work in the right-of-way
and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a provider's equipment to
protect it, the City Manager shall notify the provider's local representative
as early as is reasonably possible. The costs associated therewith will be
billed to that provider and must be paid within 30 days from the date of
billing.
      (2)   Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
equipment in the right-of-way which it or its equipment damages. Each provider
shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the equipment of
another provider caused during the City's response to an emergency occasioned
by that provider's equipment.
   (k)   Vacating of Right-of-Way.
      (1)   If the City vacates a right-of-way which contains the equipment of
a provider, and if the vacation does not require the relocation of the
provider's equipment, the City shall reserve, to and for itself and all
providers having equipment in the vacated right-of-way, the right to install,
maintain and operate any equipment in the vacated right-of-way and to enter
upon such right-of-way at any time for the purpose of reconstructing,
inspecting, maintaining or repairing the same.
      (2)   If the vacation requires the relocation of the provider's
equipment; and
         A.   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the provider, the
provider must pay the relocation costs; or
         B.   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the City, the
provider must pay the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the City
and the provider; or
         C.   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by a person or persons
other than the provider, such other person or persons must pay the relocation
costs.
   (l)   Discontinued Operations; Abandoned Equipment.
      (1)   A provider who has determined to discontinue its operations in the
City must either:
         A.   Provide information satisfactory to the City Manager that the
provider's obligations for its equipment in the right-of-way under this chapter
have been lawfully assumed by another provider; or
         B.   Submit to the City Manager a proposal and instruments for
transferring ownership of its equipment to the City. If a provider proceeds
under this division, the City may, at its option, purchase the equipment;
require the provider, at its own expense, to remove it; or require the provider
to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the City for reasonably
anticipated costs to be incurred in removing the equipment.
      (2)   The equipment of a provider who fails to comply with the
discontinued operations provisions of this chapter and which remains unused
shall be deemed to be abandoned. Unused equipment means facilities located in
the rights-of-way which have remained unused for a period of two years and for
which the provider is unable to:
         A.   Provide the City with a credible plan detailing the procedure by
which the provider intends to begin actively using such facilities within the
next 12 months; or
         B.   That it has a potential purchaser or user of the facilities who
will be actively using the facilities within the next 12 months; or
         C.   That the availability of such facilities is required by the
provider to adequately and efficiently operate its system. Abandoned equipment
is deemed to be a nuisance. The City may exercise any remedies or rights it has
at law or in equity, including, but not limited to:
            1.   Abating the nuisance;
            2.   Taking possession of the equipment and restoring it to a
useable condition; or
            3.   Requiring removal of the equipment by the provider, or the
provider's successor in interest.
      (3)   Any provider who has unused and abandoned equipment in any right-
of-way shall remove it from that right-of-way during the next scheduled
excavation, or at such different time as designated by the City Manager, unless
this requirement is waived by the City Manager.
(Ord. 4-2007. Passed 3-12-07.)
   1032.22   TERMINATION OF CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   (a)   Written Notice of Violation. The City Manager shall give written
notice of violation to a provider if it is determined that a provider has
violated any material provision or requirement of the issuance or acceptance of
a certificate of registration or any law of the City, State, or Federal
government; attempted to evade any provision or requirement of the issuance of
a certificate of registration or the acceptance of it; practiced any fraud or
deceit upon the City; or made a material misrepresentation of fact in its
application for a certificate of registration.
   (b)   Failure to Cure Violation. If a provider fails to cure a violation
within 30 calendar days after a violation notice is served by the City, then
such violation shall be a material breach and the City may exercise any
remedies or rights it has at law or in equity to terminate the certificate of
registration. If the City Manager decides there is cause or reason to
terminate, the following procedure shall be followed:
      (1)   The City shall serve the provider with a written notice of the
reason or cause for proposed termination and shall allow the provider a minimum
of ten calendar days to cure its breach.
      (2)   If the provider fails to cure within ten calendar days, the City
Manager may declare the certificate of registration terminated.
      (3)   The determination of the City Manager shall be final.
(Ord. 4-2007. Passed 3-12-07.)
   1032.23   REVOCABLE STREET PRIVILEGE PERMITS.
   (a)   Application. An application for a revocable street privilege permit
shall be in accordance with Section
1032.21, including any additional requirements contained in this chapter.
   (b)   Requirements. The requirements in this section shall be in addition to
any requirement set forth in Sections
1032.21 et seq.
      (1)   A utility service provider must have a valid certificate of
registration on file with the City before the City may issue a revocable street
privilege permit.
      (2)   When practical, in the opinion of the City, the policy of the City
is to require the underground location of a new utility system element in the
public right-of-way.
      (3)   The construction, demolition or removal of any element of a utility
system in a public right-of-way by a unity service provider must be
accomplished in a practical manner which, in the opinion of the City, results
in the least potential amount of damage and disruption of the public right-of-
way.
      (4)   The applicant shall provide a specific timetable for the permit
work to be accomplished within, detailed plans, accurate scale drawings, and
specifications in sufficient detail acceptable to the City to describe the area
of work covered in the permit application. In addition, the City may require
the applicant to provide up-to-date, accurate, comprehensive master plans of
the existing and proposed utility system. These master plans are intended to
allow the City to consider the broader context of the utility service
provider's plans upon which the permit application is based.
   (c)   Limitation on Placement of New System or Additional Elements; Denial
of Permit.
      (1)   To protect the public health, safety, and welfare in recognition of
the limitation of space in the public right-of-way, the City Manager shall have
the power to prohibit or limit the placement of a new utility system or
additional elements of an existing utility system within a public right-of-way
if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests of persons to
occupy and use the public right-of-way. In making such decisions, the City
Manager shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and
potential users of the public right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by
considerations of the public interest, the public's need for the particular
utility service, the condition of the public right-of-way, the time of year
with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing elements of
utility systems in the public right- of-way, and future City plans for public
improvements and development projects which have been determined to be in the
public interest.
      (2)   The City Manager may deny a permit to protect the public health,
safety and welfare, to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of
ordinary travel over the public right-of-way, or when necessary to protect the
public right-of-way and its users. The City Manager, in his or her discretion,
may consider one of more of the following factors: the extent to which public
right-of-way space where the permit is sought is available; the competing
demands for the particular space in the right-of-way; the availability of other
locations in the public right-of-way or in other public rights-of-way for the
utility system elements of the permit applicant; the applicability of
ordinances or other regulations of the right-of-way that affect the location of
utility system elements in the right-of-way; the degree of compliance of the
applicant with the terms and conditions of its franchise, this chapter, and
other applicable ordinances and regulations; the degree of disruption to
surrounding communities and businesses that will result from the use of that
part of the public right-of-way; the condition and age of the public right-of-
way, and whether and when it is scheduled for total or partial reconstruction;
the balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage to the public
right-of-way against the benefits to that part of the public served by the
expansion into additional parts of the public right-of-way; and the feasibility
of accomplishing the desired goal outside of the public right-of-way.
(Ord. 4-2007. Passed 3-12-07.)
   1032.24   NONLIABILITY OF CITY; INDEMNIFICATION.
   (a)   By reason of the acceptance of an application or the grant of a
permit, the City does not assume any liability for injuries to persons, damage
to property, or loss of service claims, or for claims or penalties of any sort
resulting from the installation, presence, maintenance, or operation of
facilities.
   (b)   By applying for and being issued a certificate of registration with
the City, a provider agrees, or by accepting a permit a provider is required
and agrees, to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the City's agents, elected
officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors from all costs,
liabilities, claims, and suits for damages of any kind arising out of the
construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair or operation of its
facilities, or out of any activity undertaken in or near a right-of-way,
whether any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited
by a permit, excepting only negligent acts or omissions that are willful and
wanton or intentional torts and for which immunity is not provided by the Ohio
Revised Code for such acts, omissions, or intentional torts. This exception
shall not extend to acts, omissions, or intentional torts occurring as a result
of or in response to an emergency. A provider further agrees that it will not
bring, nor cause to be brought, any action, suit or other proceeding claiming
damages, or seeking any other relief against the City's agents, elected
officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors or any claim, nor
for any award arising out of the presence, installation, maintenance or
operation of its facilities, or any activity undertaken in or near a right-of-
way, whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or
prohibited by a permit. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of
any defense or immunity otherwise available to the provider or to the City, and
the provider, in defending any action on behalf of the City, if allowable by
law, shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that
the City could assert in its own behalf. Any and all exercises of the above
shall be consistent with, but not limited to, the following:
      (1)   To the fullest extent permitted by law, each provider shall, at its
sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, its
agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors
from and against any and all lawsuits, claims (including, without limitation,
worker's compensation claims against the City or others), causes of action,
liability, and judgments for injury or damages, including, but not limited to,
expenses for reasonable legal fees and disbursements assumed by the City
related to the following:
         A.   Injuries or damage to persons or property, in any way arising out
of or through the acts or omissions of the provider, its subcontractors, agents
or employees attributable to the occupation by the provider of the right-of-
way, to which the provider's negligence shall in any way contribute, and
regardless of whether the City's negligence or the negligence of any other
party shall have contributed to such claim, cause of action, judgment, injury
or damage.
         B.   Any claim for invasion of the right of privacy, for defamation of
person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement of any copyright,
trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or any other right of any person,
firm and corporation by the provider, by excluding claims arising out of or
related to City programming.
         C.   The provider's failure to comply with the provisions of any law
applicable to the provider.
      (2)   The foregoing indemnification is conditioned upon the City:
         A.   Giving the provider reasonable notice of any claim or the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is
sought;
         B.   Affording the provider the opportunity to participate in any
compromise, settlement, or other resolution or disposition of any claim or
proceeding subject to indemnification; and
         C.   Cooperating in the defense of such claim and making available to
the provider all pertinent information under the City's control.
      (3)   The City shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any
such action or proceeding and to participate in the investigation and defense
thereof, and the provider shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such
separate counsel, if employed.
(Ord. 4-2007. Passed 3-12-07.)
   1032.25   APPEALS.
   (a)   Authorization. The following decisions of the City Manager pursuant to
this chapter are appealable to the City Council:
      (1)   The decision of the City Manager with respect to the issuance of an
exemption to the requirement of a certificate of registration under Section
1032.09(b);
      (2)   The denial of an application for a certificate of registration
under Section
1032.21(d); and
      (3)   Denial of a permit under Section
1032.23(c)(2). An appeal from the decision of the City Manager with respect to
any of these decisions may be taken to the City Council by any aggrieved
provider.
   (b)   Filing Fee. The filing fee for any appeal under this chapter shall be
one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   (c)   Time Limitation. Appeals to the City Council shall be filed within 30
days from the decision of the City Manager by filing a written notice of appeal
with the Clerk of the City Council. The notice of appeal shall specify the
grounds for such appeal, and shall be on the form prescribed by the Clerk of
the City Council. Upon receipt of an appropriately completed notice of appeal
and filing fee, the Clerk of the City Council shall transmit to the members of
the City Council all papers constituting the record upon which the decisions
being appealed were based.
   (d)   Hearing. The City Council shall schedule the hearing for the appeal
within a reasonable period of time at a regularly-scheduled City Council
meeting. Written notice of the hearing shall be sent to the aggrieved provider
at least ten days prior to the hearing. The failure of delivery of such notice,
however, shall not invalidate any subsequent proceedings. The aggrieved
provider or its representative may appear and be heard at the hearing, and
present any evidence the provider desires in support of its position.
   (e)   Decision. The City Council may affirm, reverse, or modify, in whole or
in part, the decision appealed from, and to that end, the City Council shall
have all the powers of the City Manager with respect to such decision. The
concurring vote of a majority of the members of the City Council shall be
necessary to reverse or modify any decision of the City Manager under this
chapter. The City Council shall render a written decision on the appeal without
unreasonable delay after the close of the hearing, and in all cases within 30
days after the close of the hearing.
   (f)   Records. The Clerk of the City Council shall maintain complete records
of all actions of the City Council with respect to appeals.
(Ord. 4-2007. Passed 3-12-07.)
   1032.99   PENALTY; EQUITABLE REMEDIES.
   (a)   No person shall violate any provision of this chapter. Whoever
violates any provision of this chapter, or fails to comply with any requirement
of this chapter (including a violation of a condition or safeguard established
in connection with a certificate of registration, permit, or any other City
approval), is guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree and shall be fined
not more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) or imprisoned not more than
90 days, or both, for each offense. Each and every failure to comply shall be
considered a distinct and separate offense. Each day during or upon which a
violation occurs or continues shall be considered a distinct and separate
offense.
   (b)   The remedies provided in this chapter are not exclusive or in lieu of
other rights and remedies that the City may have. The City is hereby authorized
at any time to seek legal and equitable relief for actual or threatened injury
to the rights-of-way, including damage to the rights-of-way, whether caused by
a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or other provisions of
applicable law.
   (c)   In addition to any other penalties set forth in this chapter, and the
remedy of specific performance which may be enforced in a court of competent
jurisdiction, the City Manager may assess an additional penalty of civil
forfeiture for failure to comply with any provision of this chapter. Said
penalty shall be a monetary sum, payable to the City, in the amount of five
hundred dollars ($500.00) per 24-hour day of violation and any subsequent
portion of a day less than 24 hours in length. Prior to assessing said penalty,
the City Manager shall provide written notice to the provider detailing the
failure to comply with a specific provision of this chapter. Said notice shall
indicate that said penalty shall be assessed 15 calendar days after service of
the notice if compliance is not achieved. If a provider desires to challenge
said penalty, the provider shall request a hearing before the City Manager
within ten days of service of the notice. Said hearing shall be held within 30
days of the provider's request. If the provider requests such hearing before
the City Manager, said penalty shall be temporarily suspended. However, if,
after the hearing, the City Manager determines that the provider failed to
comply with the specific provision of this chapter referenced in the notice,
said penalty shall be assessed starting 15 calendar days after service of the
notice referenced in this division and continuing for each day thereafter until
compliance is achieved. The determination of the City Manager shall be final.

   1040.01   MANAGER AS SUPERINTENDENT OF SANITARY SEWERS.
   The Manager shall also be the Superintendent of Sanitary Sewers.
   1040.02   MANAGER'S DUTIES.
   (a)   The Manager is hereby charged with the care, management and
maintenance of the entire sanitary sewerage system, under the direction of
Council, including the disposal works and outfall of the same, all main and
lateral sewer lines, manholes, flush tanks, and all the appurtenances thereof,
all the connections with the system, and all the material and labor required
for the efficient operation and maintenance of the same. He shall see that all
the rules and regulations, both of Council and the Board of Health, now in
force or that may hereafter be adopted, regarding the use of the system, are
fully and carefully observed in every particular.
   (b)   The Manager shall superintend all extensions to the system and all
repairs to the same. He shall also have charge of all house connections from
the line of the sewers to the point where the connections join the cast iron
soil pipe outlet of the premises. He shall keep and record, in books prepared
for this purpose, a true and complete plan of every connection, setting forth
the date, location, purpose, size, grade, depth, etc., which record shall be
open to all interested persons. He shall have authority to employ all the
necessary assistants and labor required, with the consent of Council or a
proper committee of the same, to properly carry out the provisions of this
chapter, but he shall incur no debt or expense against the City except such as

connection from the "Y" at the sewer to the joint at the end of the house, east
from the soil pipe three feet outside of the premises to be connected.
   1040.19   RULES FOR SANITARY SEWER CONNECTIONS.
   Rule 1. In opening any street, alley or public place all materials excavated
shall be placed so they will cause the least inconvenience to the public travel
and the excavation shall be immediately enclosed with a good and sufficient
barrier properly protected at night by red or amber lights until the work is
completed.
   Rule 2. No street, alley or public place shall be opened until the location
of the "Y" branch in the sewer has been fixed and the location of the sewer
line indicated. The exact location of the "Y" branch connections is not
guaranteed by the City; the location of the same will be indicated as given in
the original plans and notes. All pipes or other material to be used for the
connection shall be subject to inspection and approval of the Manager before
placed in the work. No old or existing sewer shall be connected with the
sanitary sewerage system unless the same is known to conform in every
particular to the requirements of these rules. Where private sewers are jointly
owned and used, the use of the same shall in all cases be limited to a single
connection and separate connections made for the use of all other premises and
the existing private sewers shall be uncovered, if required by the Manager in
order to ascertain their condition and manner of construction before the same
are allowed to be connected with the sanitary sewerage system.
   Rule 3. "Y" brackets are built into the run of the sewers for each property,
and the same shall be used in making connections to the same. In case an
additional opening is required, a "Y" branch shall be built into the line of
the sewer with the written permission and under the direction of the Manager.
The inserted "Y" branch is to conform in size to the dimensions of the sewer
line. The entire expense of placing the additional "Y" branches shall be the
property owner's.
   Rule 4. All sewer connections shall be laid in open trench, except that
sidewalks may be tunneled, and shall extend from three feet outside the
foundation walls or at the end of the cast iron soil pipe of the house sewerage
system to the street sewers or the top of the deep house connections.
   All pipe shall be at least four inches internal diameter and shall be of
standard first quality, salt glazed vitrified sewer pipe, of uniform bore, with
good sockets and free of cracks and blisters. All pipes shall be laid in a true
line or grade with curves or independent sewers and all changes in the line of
grade shall be made with curves or bands. The minimum grade allowed shall be
three-eighths of an inch to two feet. All joints shall be centered true, made
with a hemp gasket and filled with a good quality of cement mortar. Where the
connection passes through the roots of trees the Manager may order the pipes
and joints to be bedded in and covered with two inches of good cement mortar.
The ends of all pipes which are not to be immediately connected with the house
drainage system shall be securely closed and made watertight with vitrified
clay stoppers set in cement mortar. The inside of all connections shall be left
smooth and clean throughout the entire length and in all cases the same shall
be laid with use of a suitable sized follower.
   Rule 5. Cellar drains for ordinary sewage water from cellars may be
connected at the main connection, but only at a point beyond the end of a cast
iron house drainage pipe outside the cellar walls by means of a suitable "Y"
branch. The cellar connection shall be protected by an efficient and approved
handhole trap and by an approved automatic back-pressure valve between the trap
and the connection to the "Y" branch, and the separate cellar connections shall
have proper venting to the main air shaft. All cellar connections shall be made
under the direction of and to the entire satisfaction of the Manager.
   Rule 6. The Manager shall require a plan or diagram of all the internal
sewerage fittings and connections thereof of all houses where plumbing is now
installed and of all premises where the same is proposed to be installed,
before approving applications for connections to the sanitary sewerage system.
He shall allow no connection to the sanitary sewerage system nor to any
premises where the internal plumbing fittings are not in every particular in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the Board of Health.
   In addition, the Manager may require the use of suitable and accessible
grease-traps as provided in Section
1040.12 and shall see that no sewage other than that permitted by Section
1040.13 enters the main sewer line or connections thereof.
   Rule 7. The backfilling of all trenches made in any street, alley or public
place after the connection has been laid, inspected and approved by the
Manager, shall be done in layers not more than six inches deep, each layer to
be thoroughly rammed and compacted with iron rammers before filling in the next
layer, and the surface of the travel roadway outside of the curb line shall be
restored to a good and safe passable condition the same day the opening was
made. No heaping or piling up of material over the line of the trench shall
exceed four inches and all surplus material shall be at once removed from the
work. The plumbers or pipe tappers making any opening shall be responsible for
and keep the surface of the traveled roadway and lawn at all such places in
good and in safe passable condition for six months and shall be held under
their bond to make good all settlements or other displacements of the surface
due to their work.
   1040.20   INJURY OR REMOVAL OF SEWER FACILITIES.
   No person shall disturb, injure, break or remove any portion of any manhole,
lamphole, flush tank or any part of the sanitary sewers, disposal works, or
outfall of the same, or any of the appurtenances thereof, nor shall anyone
place or cause to be placed therein or thereon any injurious matter or
substance.
(Ord. 374. Passed 6-18-17.)
   1040.21   TAPPING BY NONASSESSED OWNERS.
   Where public sewers have been constructed and the cost thereof has been
wholly or partly paid out of the funds of the City or financed through the
issuance of bonds, and the owner of any property abutting upon such sewers
makes application to tap the sewers, no permit shall be issued to the abutting
property owner to make the connection nor shall the abutting property owner
make the connection unless he has first paid into the City Treasury, or given
security for the payment satisfactory to the Director of Finance, that portion
of the cost of the sewers which the property for which a connection is desired
to be made was formerly charged in the form of an assessment, but which
assessment the City has been unable to collect.
   1040.99   PENALTY; REVOCATION OF LICENSES.
   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter shall be fined not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be deemed
committed each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues. In
addition, plumbers and tappers who violate any of such provisions shall have
their licenses revoked for a period of one year.

sufficient quantity to injure or interfere with any sewerage treatment process,
constitute a hazard to humans or animals or create any hazard in the receiving
waters of the sewerage system.
      (7)   Any water or wastes containing emulsified oil or grease exceeding,
on analysis, an average of fifty milligrams of oil and grease per liter
determined as total soluble matter.
      (8)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded to a degree that
all particles will be carried freely under the flow conditions of the sewer and
with no particle greater than one-half inch in any dimension.
      (9)   Any water or wastes containing suspended solids of such character
or quality that unusual attention or expense is required to handle such
materials at the sewage treatment plant, or having a chlorine demand greater
that twenty-five parts per million.
      (10)   Any waste containing substances that would result in a violation
of the NPDES permit.
   The above list is subject to revision as required to meet current water
quality standards imposed by State or Federal agencies.
   (g)   No statement contained in this section shall be interpreted as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the City for treatment. In all such cases, the provisions
set forth in Chapter 1044 will be the governing factors in any contracts
entered into.
   (h)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the City, they are necessary for proper handling of liquid wastes
containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand and other
harmful ingredients, except that such interceptors shall not be required for
private living quarters of dwelling units. All interceptors shall be so located

the City before construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans
and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify his or her facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter.
   (b)   If, for any reason, a facility does not comply with, or will be unable
to comply with, any prohibition or limitation in this chapter, the facility
responsible for such discharge shall immediately notify the City so that
corrective action may be taken to protect the treatment system. In addition, a
written report addressed to the City detailing the date, time and cause of the
accidental discharge, the quantity and characteristics of the discharge, and
corrective action taken to prevent future discharges, shall be filed by the
responsible industrial facility within five days of the occurrence of the
noncomplying discharge.

   1043.13   REGULATION OF DISCHARGES; SYSTEM STANDARDS.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish rules and
regulations concerning discharges to the sewerage system, including determining
the acceptability or unacceptability of such discharges and the pretreatment
thereof, establishing specific limitations on certain discharges and
establishing certain other system standards.
   (b)   Right of Entry: Construction of Manholes. The City shall at all times
have free access to the premises of any user of its facilities and to the
premises of any person reasonably believed by the City to be a user or a
possible user of its facilities, for the purposes of inspecting, sampling or
testing the discharge emanating therefrom, or any discharge which may emanate
therefrom, in order to determine whether such discharge or potential discharge
is acceptable or unacceptable to the City. Where necessary, the City may
require the owner of any premises which discharges to the system to install a
suitable control manhole, together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate the observation, sampling and
measurement of the discharge or potential discharge. Such a manhole, when
required, shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the City.
The manhole shall be installed at the owner's expense and shall be maintained
by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (c)   Determination of Acceptability or Unacceptability of Discharges. The
City shall determine the acceptability or unacceptability of any discharge to
the sewerage system. Such a determination shall be made on the basis of sound
engineering and operational evaluations, and take into consideration the nature
and concentration of the discharge, its point of entry into the system, its
compatibility with other discharges in the system and the treatment facility
receiving it, and all other factors pertinent to the effect of the discharge on
any part of the system or treatment process. The operational evaluation shall
include compulsory surveys of discharge from commercial and industrial users.
   (d)   Unacceptable Discharges. Unacceptable discharges shall include those
which have been determined by the City to:
      (1)   Contain materials or substances which would constitute a hazard to

hazardous;
      (3)   Contain materials or substances which are in any way deleterious to
any part of the system;
      (4)   Contain concentrations of any toxic or deleterious materials or
substances in excess of any limits set thereon in accordance with this chapter
or State or Federal regulations;
      (5)   Cause the City to incur excessive expenses in the handling or
treatment thereof;
      (6)   Be incompatible with the treatment process or inhibit the
performance of the treatment process at the Municipal treatment facility;
      (7)   Be of such volume or contain such BOD, suspended solids or other
material load (slug) as would cause the treatment facility to exceed its design
capabilities;
      (8)   Cause the treatment facility to fail to meet effluent requirements
set by State and Federal regulatory agencies or cause such effluent to have a
degrading effect on the receiving body of water;
      (9)   Contain viable pathogenic organisms in such quantities as to be a
hazard to public health; or
      (10)   Cause the treatment facility to fail to meet effluent requirements
as established under its NPDES permit.

   1044.03   LEVY OF CHARGES.
   Commencing July 1, 1976, for the purposes provided in Section
1044.02, there is hereby levied and charged upon each lot, parcel of land or
premises having a connection with the sanitary sewerage system or otherwise
discharging sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids, either directly
or indirectly into the system, sewer charges payable as provided in Section
1044.05 and in the amounts set forth in Section
1044.04.
(Ord. 1918. Passed 6-28-76.)
   1044.04   SEWER SERVICE CHARGES.
   The following rates are hereby fixed as the fair, proportional and
reasonable rates for sewer service charges and user charges based on the
metered consumption of water. All users discharging waste to the sewage
collection system shall be billed for wastewater treatment services, including
governmental or institutional users such as schools or other public buildings.
   (a)   The minimum user charge for each user for the first 1,000 gallons of
water used, or fraction thereof, in a month, shall be $27.32 per month. The
charge for use of any amount in excess of the first 1,000 gallons of water
shall be $7.86 per 1,000 gallons per month. The charge for each user who is not
connected to the City water system shall be $52.93 per month.
      (b)   The sewer service charges and user charges may be reviewed annually
by the City of East Palestine, Ohio, in order to determine whether of not they
are sufficient to defray the fixed charges, amortization costs and annual costs
of operation, maintenance and repair of the sewerage system. If the difference
between the total annual revenue derived and the total annual cost is
sufficient to justify an increase or decrease in the sewer service charges or
user charges, the City of East Palestine will adjust the rates as required. The
purpose of the annual review is also to maintain a proportional user charge.
Each user shall be notified at least annually, in conjunction with a regular
bill, of the rate and that portion of the sewer charge which is attributable to
operation, maintenance and repair costs of wastewater treatment services.
   (c)   In the event it can be shown to the satisfaction of the City Manager,
with respect to any premises, that a portion of the water from any source
consumed on such premises does not and cannot enter the system, then in each
such case the owner or other interested party may at his or her expense install
and maintain separate watering devised to the extent necessary to demonstrate
to the satisfaction of the Manager the portion of the water consumed on the
premises which is discharged into the system, which portion shall constitute
the basis for measuring the sewerage service charge for such premises under
this section, or the owner or other interested party may, at his or her option,
request the Manager to determine the amount of water that does not and cannot
enter the sanitary sewerage system from such premises. Such determination shall
be made in accordance with accepted engineering practices, shall be conclusive
on the owner or other interested party and shall constitute the basis for
measuring the sewerage service charge.
   (d)   In the event that a premises discharging sanitary sewage, industrial
waste, water or other liquids into the City's sanitary sewerage system, either
directly or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied by the Municipal Water
Works Department of the City, and the water used thereon or therein is not
measured by a the City water meter or by a meter acceptable to the Manager,
then in each such case the amount of water so used shall be measured and
determined by a meter installed and maintained at the expense of the owner or
other interested party, and acceptable to the Manager for such purpose, or the
owner or other interested party, at his or her option, may request the Manager
to determine the amount of water used or consumed in or on such premises in
accordance with accepted engineering practices. The rate set forth herein shall
apply and shall be determined by the amount measured by such meter or
determined by the Manager.
   (e)   When a premises discharges industrial waste, either directly or
indirectly, into the City sanitary sewerage system, and the Manager finds that
it is not practical to attempt to measure such waste by meter, then such waste
shall be measured or determined in accordance with accepted engineering
practice and in conditions and attendant circumstances of the case, in order to
determine the sewerage service charge under rates set forth herein.
   (f)   Any premises making a connection with the sanitary sewerage system and
using the same after the first day of any month shall be charged a per diem
prorated amount based on the monthly minimum charge, from the time the
connection is made or such discharge into the system is begun, until the
commencement of the next following month, except that if the measured service
should exceed the prorated minimum charge, the measured rate shall be charged.
   (g)   All users of the sanitary sewerage system shall be billed for sewer
service charges. There shall be no free service.
   (h)   All sanitary sewer rental charges shall be due immediately upon
issuance. All sanitary sewer charges rendered by the City shall be paid within
twenty days from the billing date to the City or to the collection agencies
designated by the City. Any sanitary sewer charge not paid within twenty days
shall be considered delinquent and a ten percent late charge shall be assessed
against all delinquent sanitary sewer bills and must accompany the sanitary
sewer bill when paid. However, no more than one ten percent delinquent charge
shall be assessed against a given account when both water and sewer bills
remain unpaid for a period of thirty days from the billing date, after which
the sewer services shall be cut off and terminated immediately by means of
shutting off the water supply. The sanitary sewer service shall be resumed only
upon payment of the delinquent charges together with a reconnection charge of
five dollars ($5.00) in addition to any reconnection charges established with
respect to the water system.

   1044.05   SURCHARGES.
   (a)   Sewage or industrial wastes with above normal sewage strength, but
acceptable for discharge into the sanitary sewerage system, shall be subject to
a surcharge. The surcharge shall be determined on the basis of either or both
of the following two constituents of water or wastes:
      (1)   Total SS; and/or
      (2)   Five-day BOD at twenty degrees C. and as herein provided.
   (b)   When either or both the total SS and the BOD of a water or waste
accepted for admission to the system exceeds the values of their constituents
for normal sewage, the excess concentration in either, or both, as the case may
be, shall be subject to a surcharge as follows:
      (1)   Pounds of excess SS per day x $.32/lb. = SS surcharge.
      (2)   Pounds of excess BOD per day x $.37/lb. = BOD surcharge.
   (c)   In addition to the surcharge, the user will pay the use charges as

all times be responsible for any damage done by freezing, hot water, fire or
other breakage and shall be charged with the cost of repair thereof, plus the
cost of installation.
   (d)   No person shall injure, deface, mar, destroy or tamper with any water
meter.

   1224.32   GENERAL STATEMENT.
   (a)   The regulations in Sections
1224.33 to
1224.49, inclusive, of this chapter, shall control the manner in which streets,
lots, and other elements of a subdivision are arranged on the land. These
design controls shall help insure convenient and safe streets, creation of
usable lots, provision of space for public utilities, and reservation of land
for recreational uses. The planning of attractive and functional neighborhoods
shall be promoted, minimizing the undesirable features of unplanned, haphazard
growth.
   (b)   The Planning Commission has the responsibility for reviewing the
design of each future subdivision early in its design development. The
Commission shall insure that all of the requirements of Sections
1224.33 to
1224.49, inclusive, of this chapter are met.
(Ord. 12-02. Passed 7-8-02.)
   1224.33   CONFORMITY TO DEVELOPMENT PLANS.
   The arrangement, character, width, and location of all arterial and
collector thoroughfares or extensions thereof shall conform with the City's
Comprehensive Transportation Plan. Thoroughfares not contained in the
aforementioned plan shall conform to the recommendation of the Planning
Commission based upon the design standards set forth in Sections
1224.33 to

the area in which an existing zoning regulation is in effect shall be approved
unless it conforms with such regulation.
(Ord. 12-02. Passed 7-8-02.)
   1224.34   SUITABILITY OF LAND.
   (a)   If the Planning Commission finds that land proposed to be subdivided
is unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding, bad drainage,
topography, high shrink and swell soils and subject to soil slips, inadequate
water supplies, schools, transportation facilities, and other such conditions
which would endanger health, life, and property; and if, from investigations
conducted by the public agencies concerned, it is determined that in the best
interest of the public the land should not be developed for the purpose
proposed, the Commission shall not approve the land for subdivision unless
adequate methods are advanced by the subdivider for solving the problems that
will be created by the development of this land.
   (b)   Land subject to flooding, land with excessive slope, and land deemed
by the Planning Commission to be undesirable for development shall not be
platted for residential occupancy, nor for such other purposes as may involve
danger to health, life, or property or to aggravate erosion or flood hazard
Such land shall be set aside for compatible uses.
   (c)   The following rules shall apply to all subdivisions and planned unit
developments:
      (1)   All proposals for subdivisions and planned unit developments,
including those for manufactured home subdivisions, shall be consistent with
the need to minimize flood damage;
      (2)   All proposals for subdivisions and planned unit developments,
including those for manufactured home subdivisions, shall have public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage;
      (3)   All proposals for subdivisions and planned unit developments,
including those for manufactured home subdivisions, shall have adequate
drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage; and
      (4)   All proposals for subdivisions and planned unit developments,
including those for manufactured home subdivisions, and all proposals for other
developments that contain at least 50 lots or five acres (whichever is less),
whether or not subdivision is involved, shall include base flood elevation
data.
      (5)   All proposals for residential subdivisions and planned unit
developments, including those for manufactured home subdivisions, shall include
provisions for a buildable area on each lot to be elevated (naturally or by
means of fill) to the base flood level prior to sale of the lot.
   (d)   "Land subject to flooding" is defined as that land covered with water
by a 100 year flood. The 100 year flood is that which has one percent chance of
occurring in a given location in a single year.
   (e)   The regulatory flood or 100 year flood is divided into three basic
parts:
      (1)   The channel. A natural or artificial watercourse that confines and
conducts sustained or intermittent stream flow.
      (2)   The floodway. The channel and those parts of the adjoining flood
plain that reasonably are required to carry and discharge the 100 year flood
without a substantial increase in stage.
      (3)   The floodway fringe. The area within the regulatory flood plain
that is outside the floodway. The floodway fringe primarily serves as a
backwater storage area.
   (f)   Land described under division (e)(1) and (2) of this section shall be
considered as undesirable for development. Land described under division (e)(3)
of this section may be considered by the Planning Commission for approval as a
possible development area if properly filled.

relation to existing and planned streets, topographical conditions, and public
convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses
of the land to be served by such streets. The street pattern shall be designed
to conform to the topography wherever practicable. The street pattern shall
discourage through traffic in the interior of a subdivision. The subdivider
shall provide, within the boundaries of the subdivision plat, the necessary
right-of-way for the widening, continuance, or alignment of such streets in
conformity with the Comprehensive Plan.

subdivision, and if the Planning Commission finds the extensions across
undeveloped areas would not be warranted as a special assessment to the
intervening properties or as a Municipal expense until some future time, the
subdivider may be required, prior to approval of the final plat, to obtain
necessary easements for right-of-way and construct and pay for such extensions.
Such improvements shall be available for connections by subdividers of
adjoining land, upon appropriate reimbursement of the original subdivider, as

result in a slope exceeding a vertical rise of one foot for each two and one-
half feet of horizontal distance between abutting lots or between adjoining
tracts of land, except where adequate provision is made to prevent slides and
erosion by curbing and retaining walls.
   (b)   Any fill section built upon an existing slope exceeding a vertical
rise of one foot for each five feet of horizontal distance shall be benched as

this section. If such land is within a municipal corporation, such sum may be
recovered in a civil action brought by the legal representative of the City.

   1244.01   BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS; ORGANIZATION, RULES, APPEALS.
   (a)   A Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby created. Such Board shall consist
of five members, to be appointed by Council, all of whom shall be residents of
the City. The terms of all members shall be of such length and so arranged that
the term of one member will expire each year. Each member shall serve until his
successor is appointed and qualified. Members of the Board shall be removable
as provided in Section
7.11 of the Charter. Vacancies shall be filled by Council and shall be for the
unexpired term.
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Subsection (a) hereof was amended to conform to the Charter
adopted by the voters on November 6, 1991.)
   (b)   The Board shall organize and adopt rules in accordance with the
provisions of these regulations. Meetings of the Board shall be held at the
call of the Chairman and at such other times as the Board may determine. The
Chairman, or in his absence the acting Chairman, may administer oaths and the
Board may compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the Board shall
be open to the public and all business of the Board shall be transacted at such
meetings. The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of
each member upon each question, or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating
such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official
actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the Board and
shall be a public record.
   (c)   Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved. Such appeal
shall be taken within twenty days after the decision appealed by filing with
the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the Board a notice of appeal
specifying the grounds thereof. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall
forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record upon
which the action appealed from was taken. The Board shall fix a reasonable time
for the hearing of the appeal, give ten days notice to the parties in interest,
and decide the same within a reasonable time after it is submitted. Upon the
hearing, any party may appear in person or by attorney. Such appeals shall be
accompanied by payment of such fees as Council may determine from time to time.
(Ord. 1775. Passed 10-22-73.)
   1244.02   POWERS OF THE BOARD.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the following powers:
   (a)   To Interpret the Zoning Code, Specifically:
      (1)   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in
any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Building
Inspector in the enforcement of this Zoning Code;
      (2)   To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a
district divides a lot held in a single ownership at the time of the passage of
this Zoning Code; and
      (3)   To interpret the provisions of this Zoning Code in such a way as to
carry out the intent and purpose of the plan, as shown upon the Zoning District
Map fixing the several districts, accompanying and made a part of this Zoning
Code (see original Ordinance 1775, passed October 22, 1973) where the street
layout on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on the Zoning
District Map.
   (b)   To Permit the Following Two Exceptions:
      (1)   The use of premises for public utility and railroad purposes or for
a radio or television tower or broadcasting station; and
      (2)   The reconstruction of a nonconforming building that would otherwise
be prohibited by Section
1252.13(d) where such action would not constitute continuation of a monopoly.
   (c)   To Permit the Following Two Variations:
      (1)   To vary the yard regulations where there is an exceptional or
unusual physical condition of a lot, which condition is not generally prevalent
in the neighborhood and which condition when related to the yard regulations of
this Zoning Code would prevent a reasonable or sensible arrangement of
buildings on the lot; and
      (2)   To vary the parking regulations when an applicant demonstrates
conclusively that the specific use of a building would make unnecessary the
parking spaces required by this Zoning Code, but provided that such a reduction
is not more than fifty percent of the usual requirement.
   (d)   To Grant Conditional Use Permits:
      (1)   To hear and decide upon applications for conditional use permits
specifically listed in the district regulations of this Zoning Code. Before
authorizing the issuance of such a conditional use permit, the Board may impose
such conditions as will, in the Board's judgment, insure that:
         A.   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional
use will
not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or
general welfare.
         B.   The conditional use will not be injurious to the use and
enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already
permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the
neighborhood.
         C.   The establishment of the conditional use will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district.
         D.   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or other necessary
facilities will be provided.
         E.   Adequate measures will be taken to provide ingress and egress so
designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets.
         F.   The conditional use shall in all other respects conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, and the Board
shall find that there is a public necessity for the conditional use.
(Ord. 1775. Passed 10-22-73.)
      (2)   Upon receiving a request for a conditional use permit, the Board
shall set a date for a public hearing upon the proposed conditional use. In
setting the date of such public hearing, Council shall give at least fifteen
days notice thereof. Notice setting forth the time and place of such public
hearing, the name and address of the applicant, the lot number and address of
the property and the conditional use requested, shall be given by the Board in
a newspaper of general circulation in the City.

All such records shall be open to public inspection at reasonable hours, but
shall not be removed from the office of the Building/Zoning Inspector.

   (a)   When Required. No person shall alter, repair, remove or demolish a
building or structure, or commence the construction, alteration, removal, or
demolition of a building or structure, without first filing with the Building/
Zoning Inspector an application in writing and obtaining a formal permit
therefore.
   (b)   Form. An application for a permit shall be submitted in such form as
the Building/Zoning Inspector may prescribe. Such application shall be made by
the owner or lessee, or agent of either, or the architect, engineer, or
building contractor employed in connection with the proposed work. If such
application is made by a person other than the owner in fee, it shall be
accompanied by a duly verified affidavit of the owner in fee or the person
making the application that the proposed work is authorized by the owner in fee
and that the person making the application is authorized to make such
application. Such application shall contain the full names and addresses of the
applicant and of the owner and, if the owner is a corporate body, of its
responsible officers. Such application shall describe briefly the proposed work
and shall give such additional information as may be required by the Building/
Zoning Inspector for an intelligent understanding of the proposed work. Such
application shall be accompanied by payment of such fees as Council may
determine from time to time.
   (c)   Plans. An application for a permit shall be accompanied by such
drawings of the proposed work, drawn to scale, including such floor plans,
sections, elevations and structural details, as the Building/Zoning Inspector
may require.
   (d)   Plot Diagram. There shall also be filed a plot diagram in a form and
size suitable for filing permanently with the permit record, drawn to scale,
with all dimensions figured, showing accurately the size and exact location of
all proposed new construction or, in the case of demolition, of such
construction as is to be demolished, and of all existing buildings, prepared
and signed by a registered surveyor, engineer or architect.
   (e)   Amendments. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the filing of
amendments to an application or to a plan or other record accompanying the
same, at any time before the completion of the work for which the permit was
sought. Such amendments, after approval, shall be filed with and be deemed a
part of the original application.
   (f)   Action on Application. It shall be the duty of the Building/Zoning
Inspector to examine applications for permits within a reasonable time after
filing. If, after examination, he finds no objection to the same and it appears
that the proposed work will be in compliance with the laws and ordinances
applicable thereto, he shall approve such application and issue a permit for
the proposed work as soon as practicable. If his examination reveals otherwise,
he will reject such application, noting his finding in a report to be attached
to the application and delivering a copy to the applicant.
   (g)   Approval in Part. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
prevent the Building/Zoning Inspector from issuing a permit for the
construction of part of a building or structure before all plans and detailed
statements of such building or structure have been submitted or approved, if
adequate plans and detailed statements have been presented for the same and
have been found to comply with this Zoning Code.
   (h)   Conditions of Permit. All work performed under a permit issued by the
Building/Zoning Inspector shall conform to the approved application and plans
and the approved amendments thereof. The location of all new construction as
shown on the approved plot diagram, or an approved amendment thereof, shall be
strictly adhered to. No person shall reduce or diminish the area of a lot or
plot for which a plot diagram has been filed and used as the basis for a permit
unless a revised plot diagram showing the proposed change in conditions has
been filed and approved. However, this shall not apply when the lot is reduced
by reason of a street opening or widening or other public improvement.
   (i)   Signature on Permit. Every permit issued by the Building/Zoning
Inspector under the provisions of this Zoning Code shall have his signature
affixed thereto, but this shall not prevent him from authorizing a subordinate
to affix such signature.
   (j)   Limitations.
      (1)   A permit under which no work is commenced within three months after
issuance shall expire by limitation. The fee for a permit which has expired and
under which no work has been or will be done shall not be refunded.

good cause, an extension of time not to exceed six months may be allowed, in
writing, by the Building/Zoning Inspector when applied for by the person to
whom the permit was issued, and upon payment of a fee in an amount equal to
seventy-five percent of the original permit fee. The request for an extension
of time shall be filed prior to the expiration of the initial permit. Only one
such extension may be granted.
      (3)   Permits that have expired require a new application, and payment of
the full permit fee.
      (4)   The fee for work started without a permit shall be three times the
regular fee. If it is found that any person is in violation of any provision of
this chapter or any other ordinance requiring a permit, the Building/Zoning
Inspector shall issue a stop work order. The owner and/or contractor named in
such stop work order shall cease all further work on the building or structure
placed under a stop work order until such time as all requirements of this
chapter or any other ordinance listed in the order which is being violated have
been resolved to the satisfaction of the Building/Zoning Inspector or any other
official charged with the responsibility of enforcing this or any applicable
ordinances.
   (k)   Posting of Permit. A copy of the permit shall be kept on the premises
open to public inspection during the prosecution of the work and until the
completion of the same. The Building/Zoning Inspector may require a certified
copy of the approved plans to be kept on the premises at all times from the
commencement of the work to the completion thereof.
   (l)   Revocation. The Building/Zoning Inspector may revoke a permit or
approval issued under this Zoning Code when he finds there has been any false
statement or misrepresentation as to a material fact in the application or
plans on which the permit or approval was based.

provisions of this Zoning Code. Pending the issuance of a regular certificate,
a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued by the Building/Zoning
Inspector for a period not to exceed one year, during the completion of
alterations or during partial occupancy of a building pending its completion.
Such temporary certificate shall not be construed as in any way altering the

   1246.01   PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purposes of this chapter are:
      (1)   To ensure that owners of vacant property are known to the Village
and to other interested parties, and can be contacted if necessary;
      (2)   To ensure that owners of vacant property are aware of the
obligations and responsibilities of ownership under applicable laws;
      (3)   To ensure that owners of vacant property meet minimum standards of
maintenance under the law; and
      (4)   To encourage and speed the process of rehabilitating buildings to
achieve increased occupancy.
   (b)   This chapter is adopted to establish a program for identifying and
registering vacant buildings within the Village that may present fire hazards
and other health and safety hazards to the public, that may provide temporary
shelter for transients, drug users, drug dealers and other lawbreakers, that
may devalue other properties in the Village, that may detract from private and/
or public efforts to rehabilitate or maintain surrounding homes and buildings,
and that may, in general, present hazards to the health, safety, and welfare of
the public. Through a registration, inspection, and monitoring process, vacant
buildings will be kept weather tight and secure from trespassers, will provide
safe entry to police officers and firefighters in times of emergency, and will
not impede private and/or public efforts to rehabilitate or maintain
surrounding neighborhoods and buildings.

   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section
1252.10 was repealed by Ordinance 19-92, passed September 14, 1992. See Chapter
1443 of the Building and Housing Code.)
   1252.11   LARGE-SCALE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS.
   Large-scale residential developments, where permitted, are subject to the
following conditions:
   (a)   The development shall have a minimum area of ten acres.
   (b)   The housing type, minimum lot area, yard, height and accessory use
requirements shall be determined by the provisions of this section, which shall
prevail over conflicting requirements of this Zoning Code or the Subdivision
Regulations.
   (c)   The final development plan shall follow all applicable procedures,
standards and requirements of the Subdivision Regulations. The final
development plan shall be prepared by and have the seal of an architect or
engineer duly registered to practice in this State. No building permit shall be
issued until a final plat of the proposed development is approved and recorded.
   (d)   The Planning Commission shall review the conformity of the proposed
development with the standards of the official City plan and recognized
principles of civic design, land use planning and landscape architecture. The
minimum yard and maximum height requirements of the district in which the
development is located shall not apply except that minimum yards shall be
provided around the boundaries of the area being developed. The Commission may
impose conditions regarding the layout, circulation and performance of the
proposed development and may require that appropriate deed restrictions be
filed enforceable by the City for a period of twenty years from the date of
filing. A plat of development shall be recorded, regardless of whether a
subdivision is proposed, and such plat shall show building lines, common land,
streets, easements and other applicable features required by the Subdivision
Regulations.
   (e)   The number of dwelling units permitted shall be determined by dividing
the net development area by the minimum lot area per family required by the
district or districts in which the area is located. Net development area shall
be determined by subtracting the area set aside for churches, schools or other
nonresidential uses from the gross development area and deducting twenty
percent of the remainder for streets, regardless of the amount of land actually
required for streets. The area of land set aside for common open space or
recreational use shall be included in determining the number of dwelling units
permitted.
   (f)   The Commission may hold one or more public hearings on a final
development plan. The recommendations of the Commission shall be forwarded to
Council, which shall approve or disapprove the action of the Commission, with
or without modification and after public hearing. After approval by Council and
after any required restrictions are in effect, the Building Inspector may issue
permits enabling the approved final development plan to be carried out.
(Ord. 1775. Passed 10-22-73.)
   1252.12   MOBILE HOMES.
   (a)   All inhabited mobile homes shall be located in a mobile home park

shall have an area of not less than 5,000 square feet and a width of not less
than fifty feet, and no park shall be permitted an average density of more than
six mobile home lots per acre, and each park shall provide an area of not less
than eight acres.

or any structure, addition or appurtenance thereto is located less than ten
feet from the nearest adjacent court boundary.
      (3)   Space between mobile homes may be used for the parking of motor
vehicles if the space is clearly designated and the vehicle is parked at least
ten feet from the nearest adjacent park boundary.
      (4)   Each lot shall abut or face a clear unoccupied space, driveway,
roadway or street of not less than twenty feet in width, which shall have
unobstructed access to a public highway, street or alley.
      (5)   The park shall be surrounded by a landscaped strip of open space
fifty feet wide along the street frontage of a major street and twenty-five
feet wide along all other park boundaries or street frontage.
   (6)   The physical development, layout and construction of all mobile home
parks shall conform to applicable regulations of the Ohio Department of Health,
except where the requirements of this section are greater than the standards of
the State, in which case these requirements shall prevail.
(Ord. 1775. Passed 10-22-73.)
   1252.13   NONCONFORMING USES.
   (a)   Nonconforming Use of Land. In the Residential Districts, where open
land is being used for a nonconforming use, and such use is the principal use
and not accessory to the main use conducted in a building, such use shall be
discontinued not later than two years from the date of the passage of this
Zoning Code (Ordinance 1775, passed October 22, 1973). During the two-year
period, such nonconforming use shall not be extended or enlarged either on the
same or adjoining property. Any building incident and subordinate to such use
of land, such as a shed, tool house, storage building, office or trailer, shall
be removed at the end of the two-year period, or, if such building is so
constructed as to permit the issuance of a permit for a use not excluded from
the district, such building may remain as a conforming use. Thereafter, both
land and building shall be used only as conforming uses.
   (b)   Nonconforming Use of Buildings. Except as otherwise provided herein,
the lawful use of a building existing on the effective date of this Zoning Code
(Ordinance 1775, passed October 22, 1973) may be continued and expanded by an
amount not to exceed two times its present floor area, although such use does
not conform to the provisions hereof. If no structural alterations are made, a
nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming use of
the same or of a more restricted classification. Whenever a nonconforming use
has been changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming use, such use
shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted use. The nonconforming use
of a building may be hereafter extended throughout those parts of a building
which were lawfully and manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the
time of the enactment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 1775, passed October 22,
1973).
   (c)   Discontinuance of Nonconforming Uses. No building or portion thereof
used in whole or in part for a nonconforming use in a Residential District,
which remains idle or unused for a continuous period of one year, whether or
not the equipment or fixtures are removed, shall again be used except in
conformity with the regulations of the Residential District in which it is
located.
   (d)   Destruction of a Nonconforming Use. No building which has been
damaged, by any cause whatsoever, to the extent of more than fifty percent of
the fair market value of the building immediately prior to damage, shall be
restored except in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Code; all
rights as a nonconforming use shall then be terminated. If a building is
damaged by less than fifty percent of the fair market value, it may be repaired
or reconstructed and used as before the time of damage, provided that such
repair or reconstruction is substantially completed within twelve months of the
date of such damage.
   (e)   Nonconforming Advertising Signs. All advertising signs in violation of
Section
1252.14 shall be removed and such signs brought into conformity with all
requirements of Section
1252.14 on or before a date not later than five years from the effective date
of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 1775, passed October 22, 1973).
   (f)   Conditional Uses Not Nonconforming. Existing uses eligible for
conditional use permits shall not be nonconforming uses but shall require a
conditional use permit for any alteration, enlargement or extension.
   (g)   Intermittent Use. The casual, intermittent, temporary or illegal use
of land or buildings shall not be sufficient to establish the existence of a
nonconforming use, and the existence of a nonconforming use on the part of a
lot or tract shall not be construed to establish a nonconforming use on the
entire lot or tract.
   (h)   Existence of a Nonconforming Use. Whether a nonconforming use exists
shall be a question of fact and shall be decided by the Board of Zoning Appeals
after public notice and hearing and in accordance with the rules of the Board.
   (i)   Nonconforming Uses Not Validated. A nonconforming use in violation of
a provision of legislation which this Zoning Code repeals shall not be
validated by the adoption of this Zoning Code.

(Ord. 19-92. Passed 9-14-92.)
   1443.09   INSPECTIONS; ENCROACHMENTS.
   It shall be the duty of each property owner to determine property lines and
to ascertain that a fence or wall constructed as provided in this chapter does
not deviate from the plans as approved by the Manager, or his or her designated
person, and that the fence does not encroach upon another lot or parcel of
land. The City shall furnish an inspection as is deemed necessary to determine
that the fence is constructed in accordance with plans submitted for the permit
as provided in Section
1443.02. However, the issuance of a permit by the City shall not be construed
to mean that the City has determined that the fence or wall is not encroaching
upon another lot, nor shall it relieve the property owner of the duty imposed
upon him or her as provided in this chapter.

   1447.01   STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the City
Council does ordain this chapter.
(Ord. 32-2005. Passed 11-28-05.)
   1447.02   FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 32-2005. Passed 11-28-05.)
   1447.03   STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 32-2005. Passed 11-28-05.)
   1447.04   METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Ord. 32-2005. Passed 11-28-05.)
   1447.05   LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City as identified in Section
1447.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
City.
(Ord. 32-2005. Passed 11-28-05.)
   1447.06   BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (a)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Columbiana County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas dated April 5, 2006. Flood Insurance Rate Map Columbiana County, Ohio and
Incorporated Areas dated April 5, 2006.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard
include:
"Revised Hydraulic Model and Floodway Analyses for Proposed Modifications to
the East Palestine WWTP", dated June 23, 2004.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a

adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the City Manager's office, 82 Garfield Avenue,
East Palestine, Ohio 44413.
(Ord. 32-2005. Passed 11-28-05.)
   1447.07   ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 32-2005. Passed 11-28-05.)
   1447.08   INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 32-2005. Passed 11-28-05.)
   1447.09   WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 32-2005. Passed 11-28-05.)
   1447.10   SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 32-2005. Passed 11-28-05.)
   1447.11   DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory Structure.” A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.

areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).” The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill.”A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood” or “Flooding.”A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).”Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).”An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood Insurance Risk Zones.”Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMS that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.

flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS).”The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood Protection Elevation.”The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus six (6) feet of freeboard. In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway.”A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard.”A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure.” Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified, or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.” An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC).” A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.
LOMC's are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum

(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home.” A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or

purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park.” As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).”The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction.” Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of East Palestine
Flood Insurance Rate Map, effective September 4, 1987, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.

professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   “Registered Professional Surveyor.” A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   “Special Flood Hazard Area.” Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction.” The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.

the damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial Improvement.” Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction;"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   “Variance.” A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation.” The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

1447.20(d).
   (h)   Above Ground Gas or Liquid Storage Tanks. All above ground gas or
liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral movement
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1447.17(a);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas which
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the City Manager and the Chief Executive
Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1447.20(i)(1)B.1. and 3. through 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RAI-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1447.17(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
(Ord. 32-2005. Passed 11-28-05.)
   1447.21   APPEALS AND VARIANCES
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The City Council shall appoint an Appeals Board consisting of the
membership of the Board of Zoning Appeals. The members shall serve five-year
terms after which time they shall be reappointed or replaced by the City
Council. Each member shall serve until his or her successor is appointed.
      (2)   The Chairperson of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall serve as
Chairperson of the Appeals Board. Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held
as needed and shall be held at the call of the Chairperson, or in his absence,
the Acting Chairperson. All meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the
public except that the Board may deliberate in executive sessions as part of
quasi-judicial hearings in accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep
minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each question
and shall keep records of all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board
shall be kept and filed in the City Manager's office.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1447.21(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within ten (10) days of the date of such notice and order, or other
official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the
mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's
decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be
filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the
Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent
information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the
Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.    Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing.
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1447.21(d)(3)A.1. to 11. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
   (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony in
support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Columbiana County Court of Common Pleas,
as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
      (5)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this

(Ord. 17-2009. Passed 11-23-09.)
1460.03 ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Inspections authorized. The Building Inspector is hereby authorized to
make, or cause to be made, inspections of all structures or premises included
in the scope of this Code and all secondary or appurtenant structures to
determine whether such structures or premises conform to the provisions of this
Code.
   (b)   Right of entry. The Building Inspector may at any reasonable hour,
enter any building, structure, or premises within the City to perform any duty
imposed by this Code provided that permission to enter is obtained from the
occupant or, in the case of unoccupied property from the owner or his agent. If
such permission is refused or is otherwise unobtainable, a search warrant must
be obtained before such entry or inspection is made, except in the case of an
existing emergency in which case entry may be made at any time and no search
warrant is necessary. No person shall refuse to permit such emergency entry or
inspection, nor shall any person hinder, obstruct, resist or abuse any person
making or attempting to make such entry or inspection.
   (c)   Notice of violation; legal service.
      (1)   Whenever the Building inspector finds any building, structure or
premises, or any part thereof, to be in violation of the provisions of this
Code, the Building Inspector shall give or cause to be given or mailed to the
owner of such structure or premises a written notice stating the violations
therein. Such notice shall order the owner, within a stated reasonable time,
not less than thirty days, to repair, improve or demolish the structure or
premises concerned. Such delivery or mailing shall be deemed legal service of
notice.
      (2)   If the person to whom a notice of violation is addressed cannot be
found within Columbiana County after a reasonable and diligent search, then
notice may be sent by certified mail to the tax mailing address listed by the
Columbiana County Auditor, and a copy of such notice shall be posted in a
conspicuous place on the structure or premises to which it relates. Such
mailing and posting shall be deemed legal service of notice.
   (d)   Remedies for noncompliance. Whenever the owner of a structure or
premises, or part thereof, fails, neglects or refuses to comply with any notice
of the Building Inspector the Building Inspector may issue a second notice to
such owner ordering the structure or premises, or part thereof, to be repaired,
improved or demolished within such time as shall be stated in such notice, but
which shall be not less than ten days. Such notice shall be posted in a
conspicuous place on the structure or premises to which it relates. Failure to
comply with said second notice is prima-facie evidence of violation of the
Business Maintenance Code.
   (e)   Right of appeal. The owner of any structure or premises shall have the
right to appeal from any order of, or written notice issued by the Building
Inspector, within ten days from the date such notice was given or mailed or
order issued, and to appear before the Board of Zoning Appeals at a time and
place fixed by the Board, to show cause why he should not comply with such
notice. Such appeal must be in writing. Failure to file a written appeal with
the Board within the time prescribed herein shall constitute a waiver of the
right to appeal. However, filing of an appeal from any such notice shall
suspend action on enforcement of such notice until the appeal is acted upon by
the Board.
   (f)   Appeal powers of Board. In appeals to it, the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall have authority to:
      (1)   Hear and decide any appeal where it is alleged that there is an
error in any order, requirement or determination made by the Building Inspector
in the enforcement of this Code.
      (2)   Allow or permit variations where there is practical difficulty or
unnecessary hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the
provisions of this Code, so long as the varying or modification of a
requirement of this Code will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of the Code, and the public health, safety and general welfare will be
safeguarded and substantial justice done.
   (g)   Penalty does not preclude other remedial action.
      (1)   The imposition of any penalty, as provided for in this Code, shall
not preclude the Director of Law from instituting an appropriate action or
proceeding in a court of proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful repair or
maintenance; to restrain, correct or abate a violation; to prevent the
occupancy of a building, structure or premises; to require compliance with the
provisions of this Code or other applicable laws, ordinances, rules or
regulations; or the orders or determinations of the Building Inspector or the
Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (2)   In the event that the owner shall fail, neglect, or refuse to
comply with the second notice referred to above, the Building Inspector may
proceed to have the building or structure secured for safety purposes, and the
cost of such work shall be paid by the City. If the City is not immediately
reimbursed for such costs, the total cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 715.261(A)
